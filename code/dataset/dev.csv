At least one person was killed in Fukushima prefecture, north of Tokyo where four million homes were without power. The 8.9 magnitude quake caused many injuries, public broadcaster NHK said, sparked fires and the wall of water, prompting warnings to people to move to higher ground in coastal areas.
The Philippines, Taiwan and Indonesia all issued tsunami alerts, reviving memories of the giant tsunami which struck Asia in 2004. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued alerts for countries as far away as Colombia and Peru.
There were several strong aftershocks. In the capital Tokyo, buildings shook violently. An oil refinery near Tokyo was on fire, with dozens of storage tanks under threat."
earthquake,"The most-powerful earthquake in Japan's recorded history struck off the country's northeast coast on Friday, leaving hundreds of people dead, injured or missing.
The 8.9-magnitude earthquake triggered a deadly tsunami that washed far inland, swamping towns, sweeping away a train and sparking massive fires that burned through the night.
The exact death toll was not immediately clear, but there were reports that 200 to 300 bodies were found in the northeastern coastal city of Sendai alone. Another 547 are missing and 798 people were injured, police said.
Kaoru Ishikawa, the Japanese ambassador to Canada, told CBC News that officials haven't determined how many people had died after the devastating quake and tsunami.
""We are trying indeed to check what's going on, but unfortunately the scope of the casualties we don't know yet,"" he said.

earthquake,"At 12.51 p.m. on Tuesday 22 February 2011, a magnitude 6.3 earthquake caused severe damage in Christchurch and Lyttelton, killing 185 people and injuring several thousand.
The earthquake’s epicentre was near Lyttelton, just 10 km south-east of Christchurch’s central business district. It occurred nearly six months after the 4 September 2010 earthquake.
The earthquake struck at lunchtime, when many people were on the city streets. More than 130 people lost their lives in the collapse of the Canterbury Television and Pyne Gould Corporation buildings. Falling bricks and masonry killed another 11 people, while eight died in two city buses that were crushed by crumbling walls. Rock cliffs collapsed in the Sumner and Redcliffs area, and boulders tumbled down the Port Hills, with five people killed by falling rocks.
Although not as powerful as the magnitude 7.1 earthquake on 4 September 2010, this earthquake occurred on a shallow fault line close to the city, so the shaking was particularly destructive.
The earthquake brought down many buildings damaged the previous September, especially older brick and mortar buildings. Heritage buildings that suffered heavy damage included the Provincial Council Chambers, Lyttelton’s Timeball Station, the Anglican Christchurch Cathedral and the Catholic Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament. Two-thirds of the buildings in the central business district were subsequently demolished, including the city’s tallest building, the Hotel Grand Chancellor.
Liquefaction was much more extensive than in September 2010. Shaking turned water-saturated layers of sand and silt beneath the surface into sludge that squirted upwards through cracks. Thick layers of silt covered properties and streets, and water and sewage from broken pipes flooded streets. House foundations cracked and buckled, wrecking many homes. Irreparable damage necessitated the demolition of several thousand homes, and large tracts of suburban land were subsequently abandoned, with 8,000 properties bought by the government and razed."

earthquake,"7.5M Earthquake Jolts Alaska: Scientists Warn Imminent 'Mega-Tsunami' Here Within a Year Due to Melting Ice The Alaska Peninsula was hit by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Monday afternoon, October 19, triggering a tsunami warning in the region. But the threat is not over. Scientists said the melting glaciers in Alaska region could unleash a 'mega-tsunami,' with a destructive high wall of water. As per the scientists, the glacier retreat in Prince William Sound—a narrow sea channel on the south coast of the U.S. state of Alaska—is now destabilizing mountain slopes and a massive tsunami could appear as early as 2021. A group of experts in an open letter to Alaskan authorities said that collapsing mountain slopes in Alaska caused 633 feet high waves in 2015. The researchers also noted that in west Greenland, a landslide in June 2017 produced a tsunami that killed four people and destroyed a large portion of the town of Nuugaatsiaq. According to the findings, the tsunami could impact areas frequently visited by tourists, fishing vessels, and hunters. The team of scientists believes that there is a possibility that this landslide-led tsunami ""will happen within the next year, and likely within 20 years."""
earthquake,"Magnitude 7.0 Earthquake Hits Turkey and Greece The region has experienced 29 earthquakes with a magnitude of 6.0 or higher in the last 100 years On October 30, a 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck the eastern Aegean Sea between Turkey and Greece.

Over 8 million people are in this risk area, including much of eastern Michigan and northwest Ohio. A level 3 of 5, enhanced risk cover much of the rest of Ohio, Michigan and into parts of Indiana."
Typhoon,"Tropical Storm Dolly forms in North Atlantic Ocean but won't last long, forecasters say Dolly will not pose any threat to land. The storm is the 4th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season. It is also the third-earliest ""D"" storm on record. Tropical Storm Dolly formed in the North Atlantic Ocean on Tuesday afternoon, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center said. The storm’s maximum sustained winds were near 45 mph. Dolly was centered about 660 miles southwest of Cape Race, Newfoundland, and it was moving east-northeast at 13 mph. Dolly will not pose any threat to land, and its lifespan will be short, AccuWeather said. The hurricane center said that ""weakening is forecast during the next day or two as Dolly moves over colder waters, and the system is expected to become post-tropical on Wednesday. The low should then dissipate by early Thursday."" The storm is the fourth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, following Arthur, Bertha and Cristobal. It is also the third-earliest ""D"" storm on record, said Phil Klotzbach, a Colorado State University meteorologist. Records go back to 1851."
Typhoon,"Trump sends questionable tweet on Tropical Storm Fay’s threat to New Hampshire The day after the Commerce Department inspector general released the results of an investigation into President Trump’s inaccurate statements regarding Hurricane Dorian last September, Trump sent a problematic tweet about the path of Tropical Storm Fay. The tweet, posted just after 1 p.m. Friday, said that the storm, making landfall in New Jersey, was headed toward the “Great State of New Hamphire,” justifying the rescheduling of a campaign rally on Saturday evening in Portsmouth. Yet the National Hurricane Center only included the very western fringe of the state in its predicted zone of where the storm center might pass, nowhere in the vicinity of Portsmouth. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters Friday that the campaign rally was being delayed due to a “big storm” expected in Portsmouth, when forecasts from the National Weather Service showed just periodic showers and light winds likely tapering off by evening. The National Weather Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the forecast information provided by Trump and McEnany."
Typhoon,"At least 17 people have been killed in Japan by powerful typhoon Wipha, according to media reports.
The typhoon hit Izu Oshima, an island south of Japan’s capital city Tokyo, on Wednesday morning. It threw life out of gear by causing landslides and flooding in the island. More than 80 centimetres of rain fell in a span of 24 hours in the island.
Around 50 people have been reported missing.  Japan Meteorological Agency had earlier called the typhoon as once-in-a-decade-event.
The typhoon has been downgraded to a “tropical storm” and is heading north-east. Reports also say that Fukushima nuclear plant, which was badly hit when a tsunami and an earthquake struck simultaneously in March 2011, did not face much damage. Nuclear plant authorities were quoted saying, “the typhoon has caused no new damage to the plant”.
It has also been reported that many houses have been buried in mudslides, triggered by the rain, trapping people underneath. Rescue operations are on and flights and trains in Tokyo have been cancelled."
Typhoon,"Chinese authorities say at least three people have died and 1,200 homes have collapsed as Typhoon Fitow slammed into the country's east coast.
Typhoon Fitow barrelled into China's east coast early on Monday, packing winds of more than 200 kilometres an hour, state media reported.
At least three people were reported killed, all of them near the city of Wenzhou in Zhejiang province, the state broadcaster CCTV said.
One of the victims, 55-year-old Ni Wenlin, died ""after strong wind blew him off a hill"" late Sunday, Xinhua news agency said, citing municipal flood control authorities.
Another person died of electric shock, CCTV said.
In the hard-hit county of Cangnan in Wenzhou, more than 1,200 homes collapsed and damages amounted to hundreds of millions of yuan, China National Radio said.
The threat of the storm has forced about half a million people from their homes in China's Zhejiang province and tens of thousands more in the country's Fujiian province.
Thousands of fishermen were recalled to port and transport services in 35 cities have been affected with the suspension of train services."
wildfires,"Large wildfires raging throughout California have claimed at least 44 lives statewide, destroyed thousands of structures and prompted hundreds of thousands to evacuate. A fire actively burning in Northern California took at least 42 lives, becoming the deadliest fire on state record.
Large fires have scorched populated areas of California over the past week, including the Camp Fire, north of Sacramento, which incinerated the entire town of Paradise, and the Woolsey Fire, which burns northwest of Los Angeles. Firefighters on Monday also battled the Rocky Peak fire, which sprung up near where the Woolsey fire began and forced the shutdown of the Route 118 freeway. The Camp Fire has become one of California’s most destructive fires in at least a century, according to the Associated Press.
Wildfires are a natural and annual occurrence in California, typically appearing toward the end of the long, dry summers. In four out of five cases, people provide the igniting spark. At the same time, the environment has also become more flammable. As the state grows hotter and increasingly subject to prolonged droughts, and as more people live in high risk areas, the fires simply get bigger, more severe and more costly to put out."
wildfires,"A massive brushfire, the worst in Israel’s history, raged unchecked for more than eight hours Thursday, burning thousands of acres of land, forcing villages to evacuate, and killing up to 40 people when their bus was engulfed in flames. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the blaze as “a catastrophe, the likes of which we have not yet known”.
He appealed to Russia, Cyprus, Greece and Italy for help in putting out the fire, which began on the slopes of the Carmel hill, southeast of Israel’s port city of Haifa, and rapidly spread.
Cyprus and Greece agreed to dispatch firefighting helicopters.
Some nine hours after the blaze was estimated to have begun exhausted firefighters, those from Haifa reinforced by teams from all over Israel, and by soldiers, were still struggling to bring it under control, but without success.
“We’ve lost control of the fire,” a spokesman for Haifa’s firefighting services was quoted as saying.
Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovich said it was impossible to say when the fire could be brought under control. However, firefighters were speculated that as the fire spread west a major road linking Haifa with Tel Aviv to the south could act as a natural firebreak, or, failing that, the sea would.
At least 22 people were confirmed dead, but other accounts put the number as high as 40.
The fatalities were prison guards who had been drafted to help evacuate the 500 prisoners from a jail in the path of the flames. Their bus, with 50 people on board, was trapped by a falling tree and 40 of them burned to death. The others were injured.
The fire had been far from the road when the bus first set off, but spread about 1,500 metres in less than three minutes."
wildfires,"The lightning-sparked blaze began on Saturday and continues to threaten hundreds of homes.
Up to 2,000 firefighters are battling the flames.
The blaze is one of some three dozen large fires burning in the drought-hit western US states, authorities say.
Lightning storms hitting parched grass, brush and timber have brought an unusually early start to the fire season.
On Tuesday, Gov Jerry Brown announced that National Guard troops would be helping with firefighting efforts, already bolstered by federal funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Firefighters assessing the destruction from the Manton blaze, known as the Ponderosa Fire, have concluded that some 50 buildings - many residential - had been destroyed.
""There is a good chance that number [of destroyed buildings] will go up, because they haven't been able to get into the whole area affected by the fire,"" Mike Witesman, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said.
The firefighters are now focused on tackling the blaze - now said to be 40% contained - as it threatens some 3,500 homes in the small communities of Shingleton, Manton and Viola."
wildfires,"The vicious 2012 wildfire season now unfolding in the interior West is hardly a surprise. Much of the region has been in a drought for more than a decade. This winter’s snowpack was sparse, particularly in Colorado, and it melted and ran off early. Temperatures have been high, and humidity has been low—making fuels from grasses to trees very dry and flammable.
All of that means conditions ripe for fires, which have come with a vengeance. New Mexico has had its biggest fire ever, and Colorado has seen the most destructive fires in its history, with the Waldo Canyon Fire near Colorado Springs and the High Park Fire near Fort Collins destroying more than 600 homes combined. Even as firefighters have brought the big Colorado fires near containment, other large blazes have broken out in Wyoming, Utah, and Montana.
Yes, it’s looking like a big fire year. And yes, this is part of the new normal. It’s pretty much exactly what climate experts have been predicting and what the data have been telegraphing for some time. While there are various proposals on the table to deal with increasingly destructive wildfires, they are likely to continue and become worse unless we tackle climate change."
wildfires,"Firefighters in New Mexico and Colorado are battling wildfires that have spread quickly in all directions, forcing hundreds of people to flee from their homes across both states.
In Colorado, at least 18 structures, including homes, have been destroyed, while one person is missing and feared dead, according to authorities. Flames have torched more than 30 square miles in two days.
""If you talk about worst-case scenario, this is our worst-case scenario,"" Larimer County Sheriff Justin Smith said.
Hundreds of residents have been evacuated. Authorities sent at least 2,575 evacuation notices to phone numbers but it wasn't clear how many residents had to leave, according to ABC News Station KMGH-TV in Denver. About 500 people had checked in at Red Cross shelters, according to The Associated Press.
Some residents said they didn't receive any notice and their only warning was hearing the fire coming toward their doorsteps.
""It was terrible. It sounded like a hurricane,"" said Sandra Mullen, according to KMGH. ""I think everything will be gone. My husband is 78 and I'm 75, so when you're that old, it's too hard to start over.""
Resident Joanne Hertz said, ""It looked like Armageddon. I have absolutely no clue if my house is still standing.""
Resources are spread thin in Larimer County as other western states need tankers, helicopters and ground crews to battle their own wildfires, sheriff's spokesman Nick Christensen told KMGH."
wildfires,"A wildfire is burning out of control on North Mountain in Pendleton County in the Monongahela National Forest. More than 80 foresters and local firefighters are battling the blaze that started on Sunday near Upper Tract.
“[The fire] started on private land and it’s moved west/northwest on to national forest land, southwest of Petersburg,” according to Sarah Hankens with the U.S. Forest Service.
The blaze is 20 percent contained. It’s being called the North Mountain Fire and so far has destroyed 720 acres.
Bob Beanblossom with the U.S. Forest Service said crews are having a hard time reaching some parts of the fire because of the terrain in the Potomac Highlands.
“It is steep, rocky terrain. There are a lot of standing, dead trees that firefighters have to be careful of. It does certainly pose some hazards.” Beanblossom said half the battle is reaching those remote areas.
The fire is so large, the U.S. Forest Service has called in crews from out west.
“We have a lot of folks here from the Monongahela National Forest but there are crews from as far west as Oregon, Idaho and Washington,” explained Beanblossom.
Even more foresters are set to arrive from Tennessee, Virginia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Wisconsin.
Most of the fire is contained within the national forest and that’s where crews want to keep it.
“There is private property adjacent to the forest, not too far from where the fire is located,” said Hankens. “We do have personnel out on the fire line assessing both direct and indirect ways to create fire lines to try and keep the fire on national forest.”
So far, that part of Pendleton County has not seen any of the rain or snow much of the state received Tuesday morning. However, the humidity is high and that’s keeping the flames from spreading faster. Beanblossom said precipitation would drastically help the effort to gain control of the blaze."
wildfires,"Firefighters have beaten back parts of the nine blazes raging in southern California, allowing thousands of displaced locals to return to the area.
But a flare-up of a wildfire in San Marcos prompted more than 13,000 new evacuation notices to residents.
The fires have destroyed at least 18 houses and two businesses and caused more than $20m (?12m) in damage.
A badly burned body was found in Carlsbad, but no details were available on its identity or cause of death.
Schools across the region were closed and a nuclear plant and a military base were earlier evacuated.
Months of drought have made California particularly prone to fire this year, and the crews managing the evacuations and battling the blazes have had to contend with sweltering heat.
But calmer winds on Thursday allowed aircraft - including four air tankers and 22 military helicopters - to be deployed to fight the flames.
The Legoland theme park in Carlsbad was closed earlier due to power surges, while San Onofre nuclear power plant briefly evacuated non-essential staff as a precautionary measure.
And the campus of California State University-San Marcos, with almost 10,000 students, was shut down amid the university's final exams, with all commencement ceremonies cancelled.
Fires also hit the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton, between San Diego and Los Angeles.
Carlsbad fire chief Michael Davies said such fires were unprecedented this time of year."
wildfires,"Catastrophic and unprecedented bushfires in Australia have killed more than 28 people, destroyed hundreds of homes and burned hundreds of thousands of hectares of land, causing massive devastation to wildlife, ecosystems and the environment. The fires come after Australia's hottest, driest year on record. They have led to hazardous air quality in major cities throughout Australia, impacted New Zealand and sent smoke drifting thousands of kilometres across the Pacific to South America.
The fires have led to hazardous air quality in major cities throughout Australia, impacted New Zealand and sent smoke drifting thousands of kilometres across the Pacific to South America. 
The long range transport of smoke reached both Argentina and Chile on 6 January, according to the national meteorological and hydrological services.
Wildfires release harmful pollutants including particulate matter and toxic gases such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and non-methane organic compounds into the atmosphere. The fires have already released approximately 400 megatonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, according to the European Union's Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service (CAMS). On 2 January CAMS saw that the highest concentrations of atmospheric carbon monoxide in the world were over the ‘clean’ South Pacific Ocean, having come from fires in New South Wales. Taking Australia as a whole, carbon dioxide emission hasn’t been particularly high this wildfire season, but emissions from New South Wales are many times higher than the 2003_2018 average."
wildfires,"Kangaroo Island is Australia’s third largest. Its glossy black cockatoos have been one of Australia’s conservation success stories. Thanks to a recovery program that began in 1995, their numbers in the wild increased from 150 to 400. Scientists responded by downgrading the birds’ status from critically endangered with extinction to just endangered.
But that all changed in January. Now this bird is part of an unfolding horror story.
Fires have raged across nearly 50 percent of Kangaroo Island. That’s their 4,400-square-kilometer (1,700-square-mile) isle off the coast of the state of South Australia. Flames destroyed the habitat for most of the birds. It’s unclear how many glossy black cockatoos survived. For those that did, food may now be scarce. These birds eat the seeds of a single tree species: the drooping she oak.
Many years of hard work to save these birds have gone up in smoke, says Daniella Teixeira. She’s a conservation biologist who works 2,184 kilometers (some 1,360 miles) away at Australia’s University of Queensland in Brisbane. This fire has brought “a big step backwards for the recovery team,” Teixeira concludes. And it’s something she understands well. She has studied and worked to protect these cockatoos for the last four years. Even if just one in every four of the birds died, she says, this subspecies could again be deemed critically endangered with extinction.
Similar stories are playing out across Australia. As of January 12, months of wildfires had burned nearly 11 million hectares (more than 42,470 square miles). That’s an area larger than the nation of Guatemala and a little bigger than the state of Tennessee. More than 2,200 homes have gone up in flames and 29 people died. And another two months of bush-fire season still remains. Already, the toll on animals and plants, many of which are unique — found nowhere outside Australia — boggles the mind."
wildfires,"Swedish firefighters on Tuesday found the body of a man burned to death in a huge forest blaze that started five days ago, engulfing homes and tearing a path of destruction through a vast area of woodland in central Sweden.
More than 1,000 people had to be evacuated on Monday night from villages in the province of Vastmanland, about 140 kilometers (87 miles) northwest of the capital Stockholm. Thousands more locals have since been put on alert and told to prepare to leave their homes.
A truck driver was also hospitalized with severe burns after his vehicle was surrounded by flames.
""It was thick with smoke and I heard the forest was blazing. They were water bombing just above where we live,"" Tommy Persson, one of the evacuees, told Swedish news agency TT.
Emergency services estimate it could take some weeks to bring the fire under control.
Firefighters are currently being aided by 13 helicopters doing water drops over the affected area, but thick smoke and difficult terrain have hampered their efforts. Italy and France have sent firefighting aircraft to help fight the blaze.
It's unclear what sparked the fire - one of the largest seen in Sweden in recent decades. Hot, dry weather conditions are making it tricky for firefighters to bring the flames under control."
wildfires,"Wildfires continue to cause problems in the Dakotas, from shutting down a stretch of interstate to destroying a fire truck.
Smoke from a grassland fire in south central South Dakota shut down a 15-mile stretch of Interstate 90 Wednesday night. Several other fires burned across the state Thursday, including one near Wessington in the east that scorched about 320 acres and prompted the evacuation of one home. In the west, fire crews did mop-up work on a blaze that threatened several homes west of Rapid City earlier in the week.
In western North Dakota, the Killdeer Fire Department lost a pumper truck when its engine failed while crews were fighting a blaze that prompted the evacuation of one home. A fire on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation burned more than 1,000 acres, or about 1  square miles."
wildfires,"One of the state’s worst wildfire seasons in history has scorched 5 million acres of tundra and forests across Alaska, and experts here fear climate change will cause even more devastating fires through a combination of lower snowpack, drying tundra and melting permafrost.
Like an insulating blanket, snow reduces fire risk by keeping trees and grasses cold and damp. If less snow accumulates, or worse, snow covers less of the state than normal, there will be nothing to stop the near-constant summer sun from drying out the tundra and the permafrost layer below it. Permafrost, which is mostly composed of organic material, burns easily once thawed and lightning strikes.
Anchorage, for example, had its least snowy winter on record, with just over two feet of snow, the National Weather Service reported.
“We’re looking at, potentially over time, more fires burning more area,” said Kent Slaughter, the manager of the federal Bureau of Land Management’s Alaska Fire Service.
From the U.S. Army’s Fort Wainwright, Slaughter commands an army of firefighters, smokejumpers, logistics experts, pilots and supply clerks to coordinate battles most residents of the Lower 48 don't know are even happening. At the height of the fire season in early July, Slaughter and his teams were battling two wildfires that were each nearly three times bigger than any blaze in the rest of the country."
drought,"France experienced its driest July in more than 60 years, prompting the authorities to limit the use of water in more than two-thirds of the territory.
According to Météo France, from July 1 to July 28, average precipitation represented only 28 per cent of normal values ??across the country, making last month the driest July since 1959.
The southwest, Loire Valley and northeast were particularly affected by this significantly prolonged deficit of rains, known as a meteorological drought.
Prefectural decrees limiting the use of water have been issued in 73 of the country's 101 départements with 20 already experiencing crisis situations.
Hard-hit vegetation
As a consequence of this lack of rain, the country's soil is drier than usual, which is impairing the proper development of vegetation.
This agricultural drought ""must be watched"" in the northeastern region Grand Est, as well as in Auvergne-Rh?ne-Alpes, in Hauts-de-France and Lower Normandy, notes the country's meteorological agency.
This situation (drought, high temperature) also favours the development of wildfires.
Dry riverbeds
The largest French river, the Loire, is currently experiencing a sharp drop in its flow. The prefecture of the department of Maine-et-Loire, for example, has put in place many restrictions due to the situation.
Waterways have even completely disappeared in the northeast of the country, like the Doubs which is completely dry with the riverbed transformed into grazing ground for cattle.
This phenomenon had already been observed two years ago when this river had been completely dry for more than six months."
drought,"The water crisis along the California-Oregon border went from dire to catastrophic this week as federal regulators shut off irrigation water to farmers from a critical reservoir and said they would not send extra water to dying salmon downstream or to a half-dozen wildlife refuges that harbor millions of migrating birds each year.
In what is shaping up to be the worst water crisis in generations, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation said it will not release water this season into the main canal that feeds the bulk of the massive Klamath Reclamation Project, marking a first for the 114-year-old irrigation system. The agency announced last month that hundreds of irrigators would get dramatically less water than usual, but a worsening drought picture means water will be completely shut off instead.
The entire region is in extreme or exceptional drought, according to federal monitoring reports, and Oregon’s Klamath County is experiencing its driest year in 127 years.
“This year’s drought conditions are bringing unprecedented hardship to the communities of the Klamath Basin,” said Reclamation Deputy Commissioner Camille Calimlim Touton, calling the decision one of “historic consequence.” “Reclamation is dedicated to working with our water users, tribes and partners to get through this difficult year and developing long-term solutions for the basin.”
The canal, a major component of the federally operated Klamath Reclamation Project, funnels Klamath River water from the Upper Klamath Lake just north of the Oregon-California border to more than 130,000 acres (52,600 hectares), where generations of ranchers and farmers have grown hay, alfalfa and potatoes and grazed cattle.
Only one irrigation district within the 200,000-acre (80,940-hectare) project will receive any water from the Klamath River system this growing season, and it will have a severely limited supply, the Klamath Water Users Association said in a statement. Some other farmers rely on water from a different river, and they will also have a limited supply.
“This just couldn’t be worse,” said Klamath Irrigation District president Ty Kliewer. “The impacts to our family farms and these rural communities will be off the scale.”
At the same time, the agency said it would not release any so-called “flushing flows” from the same dam on the Upper Klamath Lake to bolster water levels downstream in the lower Klamath River. The river is key to the survival of coho salmon, which are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. In better water years the pulses of water help keep the river cool and turbulent — conditions that help the fragile species. The fish are central to the diet and culture of the Yurok Tribe, California’s largest federally recognized tribe."
drought,"Ongoing drought in Idaho will drastically shorten this year’s irrigation season for some farmers, officials said.
Farmers in south-central Idaho’s Wood River basin will face some of the biggest shortages, with an estimated 40 to 45 days before water from the Magic Reservoir runs out, according to David Stephenson, manager of Big Wood Canal Co. In a normal season, farmers might get water into late September.
Magic Reservoir, which supplies water to 36,000 acres of farmland, was only about a quarter full this year before dams were released last week, kicking off the season.
The reservoir holds water that flows through Big Wood River from melted snowfall in the mountains. The river is flowing at about 16% of its normal rate this year after record-low winter precipitation levels, Boise State Public Radio reported.
Prior to the winter, a dry summer and fall last year meant groundwater was already depleted as irrigators south of Bellevue pumped out of the aquifer, searching for any leftover moisture.
Carl Pendleton, a farmer who gets all of his water from Magic Reservoir, said the outlook is dismal.
“I sold my cow herd last week, the first time I’ve been out of livestock in my lifetime,” he said. “That’s the decisions we’re making based on this amount of water.”
The Idaho Department of Water Resources this spring could decide to curtail groundwater pumping to the north, which Pendleton said goes unchecked and exacerbates the shortages so that there isn’t enough to go around.
The federal Natural Resources Conservation Service said Lost River, parts of the Snake River and the Oakley and Salmon Falls reservoirs will also feel the effects of the drought."
drought,"Namibia is facing a ""natural disaster"" because of poor rains, President Hage Geingob says.
He has declared a state of emergency - the second in three years - over the situation, mobilising all government agencies to respond to the drought.
The lack of rain has already left 500,000 people - one in five Namibians - without access to enough food, the government says.
The sparsely-populated country has seen a succession of droughts since 2013.
The government had set aside 40m (30m) to buy food and water tanks, and to transport livestock to and from grazing areas.
Prime Minister Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila has appealed for international help.
""We... call on all Namibians and development partners to assist in any way possible, so that we provide to our people who are affected, as well as the livestock,"" she said in the national assembly.
At least 60,000 domestic animals have died in the past six months.
Those affected are facing severe food shortages following the prolonged drought, the prime ministers's office, which is coordinating the response, has said.
President Geingob blamed a poor rainy season, which is usually comes between January and March, for being behind the problem.
Rivers have dried up in the north of the country, and people are depending on food and water relief from the government, journalist Tuyeimo Haidula told the BBC.
Livestock have been worst affected by the drought, she said.
Information and Communication Minister, Stanley Simataa, has asked farmers to reduce livestock to reasonable numbers that they can build when the situation changes, national broadcaster NBC reports.
The vast mineral-rich southern African nation imports around 70% of its food from neighbouring South Africa.
Its expansive arid geography makes it difficult to grow crops for subsistence use."
drought,"California is officially free of drought after more than seven years, drought monitors said Thursday.
The Golden State has experienced some form of drought for 376 consecutive weeks, the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska, tweeted. It’s the first time the state has been free of drought since Dec. 20, 2011.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration tweeted that weather in 2017 helped matters, but moderate drought persisted. Rainfall this winter further alleviated the drought, although 7 percent of the state remains ""abnormally dry.""
""The storms this year have really helped snowpacks, the reservoirs,"" said Jessica Blunden, a climatologist with NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information. Colder temperatures also helped prevent snow from melting off, she said.
This winter — the meteorological winter starts on Dec. 1 and ends at the end of February — has been the wettest in the United States as a whole since records started being kept in 1895, with an average across the nation of 9.01 inches, which is 2.22 inches above the nationwide average, Blunden said.
That precipitation has not just benefited California. ""It’s been a great winter for the West,"" she said.
The U.S. Drought Monitor website, which is an effort by several agencies including NOAA and the national drought mitigation center, says that well-above precipitation in the West helped build snow pack and fill reservoirs, and that normal conditions have returned to the Salton Sea in the southeastern part of the state.
The Los Angeles area experienced cool winter temperatures that brought the fifth-longest streak of 41 consecutive days with a high temperature below 70 degrees since records began in 1877. Rare snowfall was reported in parts of the Los Angeles area in February."
drought,"A potent combination of record-breaking heat and a lack of rain has led to the rapid development of drought across the southeastern United States and Tennessee and Ohio Valleys during September 2019. Coming off an extremely wet 2018 east of the Rockies, the fast onset of widespread extensive drought has been quite the climate whiplash for millions across the Southeast.  With warmer than average temperatures expected to continue and October being a generally dry month based on climatology, drought conditions are likely to continue and possibly expand and intensify over the next week.
The extent to which drought has overtaken the southeastern United States by the end of September would have been hard to explain to residents of the region just a month prior.  While a few localized areas in Georgia/Alabama were already mired in drought, the broader region extending into the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys was drought free. In fact, the twelve-month period (September 2018-August 2019) coming to an end was record wet. But then, while it continued to be hot, things turned incredibly dry.
The rapid onset and severity of the event qualified it as a “Flash drought.” Generally, droughts are caused by a lack of precipitation over an extended period of time. In contrast, a flash drought is preceded not just by a lack of rain, but also very high temperatures and/or lots of sunny days. Even if the dry period is not especially severe, the latter two can suck moisture from the ground quickly.
For operational purposes, NOAA National Weather Service’s Climate Prediction Center defines a flash drought as an event during which an area experiences degradation by two or more drought categories in a four week period, based on the U.S. Drought Monitor."
drought,"The spectre of drought looms over the country almost as a certainty like the annual floods. This year large swathes of almost all central Indian states are reeling under severe water scarcity. Much beyond the news reports, statistics and the weather graphs, the drought is a calamity that unfolds in the anguish of people struggling for water. India Today sent its team of photographers deep into the drought-affected districts of the country to capture the widespread severity of the situation - what they have photographed goes beyond the routine imagery of cracked earth and dried river beds - these are images that show how the drought is lived through.

(RNS) — The Rev. Cecil Richards is working with members of his Kingstown Baptist Church to help feed people in St. Vincent who have been evacuated due to the volcanic eruption on the island nation. Soon after the initial eruption on Friday (April 9), volunteers prepared 170 meals from their church kitchen to distribute to evacuees at shelters in the southern part of the main island. The total meals increased to 250 by Monday and, he hopes, 300 soon. “That is only our immediate response,” he said of his church that is usually attended by 250 to 300 people in nonpandemic times. “That can’t be it.”"

Experts called it a “huge explosion” that generated pyroclastic flows down the volcano’s south and southwest flanks. “It’s destroying everything in its path,” Erouscilla Joseph, director of the University of the West Indies’ Seismic Research Center, told the Associated Press. “Anybody who would have not heeded the evacuation, they need to get out immediately.”"

Villagers have been left without food and traditional springs and streams have been polluted. The Afar regional government says the numbers affected could rise sharply. Save the Children told the BBC the authorities had sent a team to conduct a detailed assessment of the situation. An initial report by the regional government says the situation in border villages is a serious concern. ""Many community members and especially children are reported sick and in desperate need of medical attention,"" said Teshome Assefa, of Save the Children. ""Vomiting and retching are common."" The whereabouts of one community living close to the eruption is unknown. The Nabro volcano has sent the plumes of ash 13km (eight miles) into the air."
other,"What made Guatemala’s Fuego Volcano eruption so deadly? On Sunday, Guatemala’s Volcán de Fuego — “Volcano of Fire” — erupted violently, spewing ash nearly four miles into the air and burying villages under an avalanche-like phenomenon called a pyroclastic flow. The disaster’s fatalities had risen to 62 by Monday afternoon, with hundreds more injured. The death toll is expected to climb, and the country’s disaster agency said 3,265 people had been evacuated. In the aftermath, some residents criticized local authorities, asking why there was no advance warning and why officials waited so long to tell them to leave. The 12,000-foot “Volcano of Fire” has been erupting on and off since 2002, and Guatemala has a national institute — INSIVUMEH — committed to actively monitoring the country’s volcanoes. The PBS NewsHour spoke with a panel of volcanologists about why this eruption was so devastating. They said despite the destruction so far, the worst may be yet to come."
other,"How Guatemala has dealt with volcanoes over the centuries June 8, 2018 7.33pm AEST When the Fuego volcano near Antigua, Guatemala erupted on June 3, it wasn’t immediately apparent to the people living on its slopes quite how dangerous this event would be. The explosive nature, speed and direction of the eruption were all unexpected. Entire villages were destroyed, and houses covered in thick ash. The death toll stands at at least 99, hundreds of people are missing, and further volcanic activity is hindering rescue efforts. Guatemalans have come together in solidarity with the victims and are responding generously to calls to donate basic necessities and money. Celebrities, foreign governments and aid organisations are all pledging their help. This is the worst volcanic eruption in Guatemala for more than a century, but it’s not an isolated event _ Fuego is an active volcano that erupts with some regularity. As one official put it, at first this seemed like “one of those normal eruptions that people are used to”. Several teenagers died because they wanted to take in the spectacle of the eruption, not realising that this one was different."
other,"Despite risks, villagers made Taal Volcano island their home TALISAY, Philippines — It’s the second-most active volcano in the Philippines, a designated permanent danger zone long declared off-limits to human settlements. Yet to more than 5,000 people the Taal Volcano is home. A lush island dotted with dozens of craters in the middle of a shimmering lake, the volcano roared into action Sunday with a mighty eruption that shot rocks, ash and steam miles into the sky just hours after the inhabitants of its four villages fled on a flotilla of boats. A man who defied official warnings about the ongoing eruption to sneak back to the island to check on his pigs, says there is complete devastation."
other,"A Covid outbreak first discovered in the Chinese city of Nanjing has spread to five provinces and Beijing, with state media calling it the most extensive contagion after Wuhan.
Almost 200 people have been infected since the virus was first detected at the city's busy airport on 20 July.
All flights from Nanjing airport will be suspended until 11 August, according to local media.
Officials also began city-wide testing amid criticism for their ""failure"".
All 9.3 million of the city's residents - including those visiting - will be tested, said state-controlled Xinhua news.
Posts on social media show long lines of people queuing, and authorities have reportedly urged people to wear masks, stand one metre apart and avoid talking while they wait.
Officials said the highly contagious Delta variant of the virus was behind the infections, adding that cases had spread further because of how busy the airport is.
Ding Jie, a health official in Nanjing, told reporters the cases were linked to cleaners who worked on a flight from Russia that arrived in the city on 10 July.
The cleaners did not follow strict hygiene measures, Xinhua News reported.
The airport management has been rebuked, with a senior disciplinary body of the Communist Party saying it had ""problems such as lack of supervision and unprofessional management"".
Testing has shown that the virus has now spread to at least 13 cities including Chengdu and the capital Beijing.
However, experts quoted by the Global Times said they believed the outbreak was still at an early stage and could be controlled.
Local officials in Nanjing said that seven of those infected were in critical condition.
The new spike in cases has led some on Chinese social media to speculate about whether the Chinese vaccines were working against the Delta variant.
It is unclear if those infected were vaccinated.
A number of South East Asian countries relying on Chinese vaccines have recently announced they will use other jabs.
China has so far managed to keep the virus largely under control by closing borders and moving quickly to stamp out local outbreaks."
other,"After more than a decade of dominance the era of Usain Bolt is over and someone other than the Jamaican great will be crowned men's 100m champion at the Tokyo Olympics.

Bolt will go down as one of the greatest athletes of all time having stormed to 100m victory at the Beijing, London and Rio Games, adding three successive 200m golds for good measure.

But the world record holder retired from athletics in 2017, finally giving someone else a chance of glory.

With time having also caught up with 2004 gold medallist Justin Gatlin, and world champion Christian Coleman serving an 18-month anti-doping ban, this feels very much like the start of a new era in the Olympics' traditional blue riband event."
other,"Critics have praised Billie Eilish's hotly-anticipated second album Happier Than Ever for its unflinching portrayal of life as a teenage pop megastar.
The follow-up to her 2019 debut When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?, it addresses the pressures of fame, as well as weighty issues facing young women, including sexual coercion.
Reviewers said the record is ""defiant"" despite its ""muted"" tone.
The Guardian's Alexis Petridis gave the ""universally great"" album four stars.
He said that ""on perhaps the most anticipated album of 2021, Eilish uses subdued yet powerful song writing to consider how fame has seeped into every corner of her life.
""Listening to a pop star complaining about being a pop star is usually enervating. It says something about Eilish's skill as a song writer that, in her hands, the topic feels genuinely affecting.""
This is partly, he wrote, because despite her stratospheric success, Eilish continues to express her fears with relatable intimacy as pop's anti-hero."
other,"President Joe Biden says US forces will end their combat mission in Iraq by the end of this year, but will continue to train and advise the Iraqi military.
The announcement came after Mr Biden held talks with Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi at the White House.
There are currently 2,500 US troops in Iraq helping local forces counter what remains of the Islamic State group.
Numbers of US troops are likely to stay the same but the move is being seen as an attempt to help the Iraqi PM.
The US presence in Iraq has become a major issue since top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani and the leader of an Iran-backed Shia Muslim militia were killed in a US drone strike in the capital Baghdad last year.
Political parties aligned to Iran have demanded the withdrawal of all forces from the US-led global coalition against IS, despite the continuing threat posed by the Sunni jihadist group.
Shia militias have meanwhile been accused by the US of carrying out hundreds of rocket, mortar and drone attacks on Iraqi military bases that host coalition forces in an apparent attempt to pressure them to leave.
For the US president, the announcement marks the end of another war that began under former President George W Bush. This year he said US troops would leave Afghanistan."
