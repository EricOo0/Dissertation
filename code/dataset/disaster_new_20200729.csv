earthquake,"Deadly earthquake hits Indonesia: Dozens killed, hundreds injured","The earthquake unleashed dozens of aftershocks, some six kilometres northeast of the city of Majene,  causing heavy damage across the city, including to the five-story Mitra Manakarra Hospital where eight people were reportedly trapped inside.  
“The Governor’s office, two hotels, a mall, a community health centre, and over 300 houses also sustained damage”, said the spokesperson for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Jens Laerke. 
Local authorities have reported that 638 people have been injured and more than 18,000 have been temporarily displaced to 10 evacuation sites.  
However, these numbers are expected to increase as assessments continue.  
“The earthquake interrupted the access road between?Majene?and the provincial capital?Mamuju?in three different locations”, said Mr. Laerke.  
“Electricity, communications network and fuel supply have also been disrupted”, he added.
The OCHA spokesperson pointed out that the earthquake?followed?a 5.7 magnitude shock that rocked the same area on Thursday afternoon.? 
The chief of Indonesia’s Meteorology and Geophysics agency, Dwikorita Karnawati, warned that strong aftershocks could follow, telling a news conference that there had already been at least 26, after the two quakes had rocked the area, since Thursday afternoon. 
“The structures of the materials and rocks under the earth are unstable or weak after 28 tremors, and these may cause an underwater landslide and trigger a tsunami”, she said, recommending that people stay away from the coast if another strong quake strikes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
earthquake,Indonesia earthquake: dozens dead after tremors and landslides hit Sulawesi,"Thousands flee for safety and higher ground after island’s second quake in 24 hours
At least 37 people have been killed and hundreds injured following a strong earthquake that shook the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia early on Friday morning, prompting landslides and destroying houses.
Thousands of people fled their homes to seek safety when the 6.2-magnitude earthquake hit just after 1am local time on Friday morning. The epicentre was 6km north-east of Majene city in West Sulawesi.
Hundreds of buildings were destroyed or damaged, including a hospital, which collapsed with more than a dozen patients and staff trapped beneath it.
“The hospital is flattened,” said Arianto, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, from the rescue agency in Mamuju city, near Majene. Rescuers were also trying to reach a family of eight buried beneath the rubble of their destroyed home, he told AFP.
At least 37 people have been killed in Majene and Mamuju, and rescue workers fear the death toll will rise further. “Many of the dead are buried under rubble,” said Ali Rahman, the head of the local disaster mitigation agency in Mamuju.

The Alaska Peninsula protrudes from mainland Alaska and is flanked to the southwest by the Aleutian Islands.
Reports of significant damage, if any, weren't immediately available. A tsunami warning initially was issued for south Alaska and the Alaska Peninsula, but was canceled by early Wednesday, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The warning sent people to higher ground in cities like Sand Point, an island community of about 1,000 people off the peninsula, the Anchorage Daily News reported.
People in Sand Point gathered at a high school until shortly after midnight, when officials gave an all-clear, Jordan Keeler, an Anchorage-based city administrator, told the newspaper.
""The first wave didn't materialize, which is a great thing,"" Keeler, who was in contact with staff in Sand Point, told the Anchorage Daily News. No reports of major structural damage were made on the island, Keeler told the newspaper.

earthquake,,"A strong 7.3-magnitude earthquake struck off Japan's east coast late Saturday, rattling the region hit by the powerful 2011 quake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown just weeks before the disaster's 10th anniversary.
The quake produced powerful shaking along parts of Japan's eastern coast, and was felt strongly in Tokyo, but triggered no tsunami alert.
Kyodo news agency reported at least 30 people injured, but gave no further details.
There were no immediate reports of significant damage, though local news broadcast images of a landslide on a highway.
Japan's meteorological agency said the quake hit at 11:08 pm (1408 GMT) at a depth of 60 kilometres (37 miles) in the Pacific off Fukushima -- near the epicentre of the 2011 killer quake which triggered a towering tsunami and killed more than 18,000 people.
The agency initially reported the strength of the quake as 7.1, but later revised the figure upwards. It said the quake was considered an aftershock of the massive 2011 temblor.
Aftershocks continued to rattle the region in the hours afterwards and officials cautioned local residents to be vigilant. A handful of people were reported to have sought shelter at evacuation centres.
""We are working quickly to collect information but we still have no details to announce. There were some unconfirmed reports about landslides but we are still checking,"" Mikihiro Meguro, an official from the Fukushima prefectural government, told AFP.
Around 950,000 homes lost power throughout the affected region, but no abnormalities were reported at the Fukushima nuclear plant, which melted down in the wake of the 2011 tsunami.
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga was called to his office, and broadcaster NHK said the government would set up a special liaison office to coordinate with affected regions.
""All messed up""
Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato addressed reporters after midnight and said evaluations were under way.
""As far as damage, casualties and structural damage are being assessed,"" he said, adding that sections of the bullet train had been suspended due to power outages.
""Surveys are being done at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant,"" he said.
""We have received reports that Onagawa nuclear plant and Fukushima Daichi nuclear plant are not showing any abnormality,"" he added.

earthquake,,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- One of the biggest earthquakes to hit the South Pacific in modern history forced thousands of people in New Zealand to evacuate and triggered tsunami warnings across the world Friday, but it did not appear to cause injuries or major damage because it struck in remote ocean.
The magnitude 8.1 quake was the largest in a series of tremors that hit the region over several hours, including two earlier quakes that registered magnitude 7.4 and magnitude 7.3.
The earthquakes triggered warning systems and caused traffic jams and some chaos in New Zealand as people scrambled to get to higher ground, but their remoteness meant they did not appear to pose a widespread threat to lives or infrastructure.
The largest quake struck about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) off the coast of New Zealand. One of the earlier quakes hit much closer to New Zealand and awoke many people as they felt a long, rumbling shaking.
“Hope everyone is ok out there,” New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern wrote on Facebook during the night.
After the largest quake, civil defense authorities in New Zealand told people in some coastal areas to immediately get to higher ground. They said a damaging tsunami was possible, and waves could reach up to 3 meters (10 feet).
Emergency Management Minister Kiri Allan told reporters that people had followed the advisory.
“They felt the long or strong earthquakes and they knew to grab their bag and head into the highlands,” she said. “I can only thank and acknowledge the tireless efforts of the men and women from up and down the coast who knew how to act, when to act, and what to do.”
She warned that the threat could remain throughout much of the afternoon and people should not return home until authorities gave the all-clear. Allan said evacuations took precedence over coronavirus distancing measures.
The U.S. Tsunami Warning System also cautioned the quake could cause tsunami waves of up to 3 meters (10 feet) in Vanuatu and up to 1 meter (3 feet) in Australia, Fiji, French Polynesia and as far away as Mexico and Peru.
The U.S. Geological Survey said it was centered near the remote Kermadec Islands at a depth of 19 kilometers (12 miles).
The agency said in a report that the quake occurred at the intersection of the Pacific and Australia tectonic plates and eclipsed the largest quake previously recorded in the region, a magnitude 8.0 in 1976.
It said the interaction between the plates creates one of the most seismically active regions in the world, and it has recorded 215 quakes there above magnitude 6.0 over the past century.
Jennifer Eccles, an earthquake expert at the University of Auckland, said the quake was at the top end of the scale for those involving only the Earth's ocean crust.
“This is about as big as it gets,” she said.
She said most quakes larger than magnitude 8.0 tend to occur when a section of more robust continental crust is involved.
The U.S. Geological Survey said the magnitude 7.4 quake was likely a “foreshock” that contributed to the larger quake but that the first quake that hit closer to New Zealand was too far away in time and distance to have directly contributed.
Officials in New Zealand had hours earlier issued a tsunami warning for coastal areas after the first quake struck off its northeastern coast at about 2:30 a.m. Friday. There were no immediate reports of serious damage or casualties, and the warning was lifted just before the largest quake hit.
The U.S. Geological Survey said the first quake was centered at a depth of 21 kilometers (13 miles) under the ocean about 174 kilometers (108 miles) northeast of the city of Gisborne.
It was widely felt in New Zealand, and residents in the major cities of Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch reported being shaken awake.

earthquake,,"AS SO often with earthquakes, this one started almost imperceptibly. It was lunchtime, and people in Tokyo are apt to take tremors lightly. It took just a frozen heartbeat, though, for that to change. One of us was seated at a coffee shop along a huge slab of oak that sat 14. It shook so violently, people raced outside. Another of us was next to a busy kitchen; metal pots shook, then crashed off the shelves, and with the noise diners came rushing up from tables in the basement and out into the streets. Within minutes, Tokyo's narrow alleys were choked with people, some visibly shocked, most eerily quiet, listening to the clanking power lines overhead, and quite understandably bereft without mobile-phone signals. As I walked onto one of the shopping boulevards of Omote-Sando, a sea of evacuees from the buildings that run along it let out a roar of fear when a second—and then a third—aftershock hit. As cars swayed, and trees lurched overhead, you could feel the power of the beast writhing underneath Japan.
The country has long prepared for something like this—and it showed. Friends quickly offered advice. Stay in open spaces; when back at home, fill up your bath and your rice cooker, so that there is plenty of food and water in reserve. Though phone signals were mostly dead (apparently to leave bandwidth for emergency services), the internet functioned. That meant e-mail and Skype worked, and Facebook and Twitter conveyed news, tips and just the sort of offbeat information that is uplifting in the face of adversity (according to one Facebook rumour, this being Japan, airlines are generously offering cheap flights for anyone wanting to leave the country).

earthquake,,"The most surprising thing about the magnitude-8.9 earthquake that hit Japan today is that it was a surprise. Despite what may be the world's most intensive effort to map faults and assess risks by a notoriously earthquake-prone and earthquake-conscious nation, such a strong quake was not anticipated for the region, says University of Tokyo geophysicist Robert Geller.
The earthquake occurred 130 kilometers east of Sendai and 373 kilometers northeast of Tokyo, along or very near the boundary between two tectonic plates, where the Pacific plate is being drawn under the Japanese islands. Movement along plate boundaries is known to be capable of producing major earthquakes. And Japan's latest national seismic risk map gave a 99% chance of a magnitude-7.5 or greater quake occurring in that area in the next 30 years, Geller says.
Although today's quake technically satisfies that prediction, the logarithmic scale used for measuring the power of earthquakes means that a magnitude-8.9 earthquake releases well over 100 times more energy than does a magnitude-7.5 quake.

earthquake,,"At 12.51 p.m. on Tuesday 22 February 2011, a magnitude 6.3 earthquake caused severe damage in Christchurch and Lyttelton, killing 185 people and injuring several thousand.
The earthquake’s epicentre was near Lyttelton, just 10 km south-east of Christchurch’s central business district. It occurred nearly six months after the 4 September 2010 earthquake.
The earthquake struck at lunchtime, when many people were on the city streets. More than 130 people lost their lives in the collapse of the Canterbury Television and Pyne Gould Corporation buildings. Falling bricks and masonry killed another 11 people, while eight died in two city buses that were crushed by crumbling walls. Rock cliffs collapsed in the Sumner and Redcliffs area, and boulders tumbled down the Port Hills, with five people killed by falling rocks.
Although not as powerful as the magnitude 7.1 earthquake on 4 September 2010, this earthquake occurred on a shallow fault line close to the city, so the shaking was particularly destructive.
The earthquake brought down many buildings damaged the previous September, especially older brick and mortar buildings. Heritage buildings that suffered heavy damage included the Provincial Council Chambers, Lyttelton’s Timeball Station, the Anglican Christchurch Cathedral and the Catholic Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament. Two-thirds of the buildings in the central business district were subsequently demolished, including the city’s tallest building, the Hotel Grand Chancellor.
Liquefaction was much more extensive than in September 2010. Shaking turned water-saturated layers of sand and silt beneath the surface into sludge that squirted upwards through cracks. Thick layers of silt covered properties and streets, and water and sewage from broken pipes flooded streets. House foundations cracked and buckled, wrecking many homes. Irreparable damage necessitated the demolition of several thousand homes, and large tracts of suburban land were subsequently abandoned, with 8,000 properties bought by the government and razed.",https://nzhistory.govt.nz/page/christchurch-earthquake-kills-185,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It hit at 2:10 p.m. and the epicenter was a relatively shallow 6 miles beneath the surface. The quake could be felt strongly in Santiago, the largest city in eastern Cuba, said Belkis Guerrero, who works in a Catholic cultural center in the center of Santiago “We were all sitting and we felt the chairs move,” she said. “We heard the noise of everything moving around.” She said there was no apparent damage in the heart of the colonial city. “It felt very strong but it doesn’t look like anything happened,” she told The Associated Press. The quake also hit the Cayman Islands, leaving cracked roads and what appeared to be sewage spilling from cracked mains. There were no immediate reports of deaths, injuries or more severe damage, said Kevin Morales, editor-in-chief of the Cayman Compass newspaper.

earthquake,,"Sand Point’s docks and road damaged in 7.8 quake A magnitude-7.8 Aleutian earthquake late Tuesday night prompted tsunami warnings in communities across coastal Alaska, from Homer to Unalaska.  Sand Point is a fishing community of about a thousand people, located about 550 miles southwest of Anchorage in the eastern portion of the Aleutian Chain. Earthquake damage closed both its city docks, which it uses to land the M/V Tustumena ferry and freight boats, and damaged the road to the harbor. The floor sank in a warehouse on Sand Point’s old dock, creating a large crack across the length of the cement, according to City Administrator Jordan Keeler. He said a team of engineers will inspect the damage in the next week or so, and he’s confident that it looks worse than it actually is.  “We have two docks total and they are both closed, effective immediately until we can get an inspection to verify the extent of the damage to both the new dock and the old dock,” Keeler said.  In the meantime, closing down the docks could mean that freight shipments will be cancelled until they reopen. That could impact the island community’s ability to get fresh food, he added.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

earthquake,,"Large earthquake off Alaska prompts tsunami fears, fleeing A magnitude 7.5 earthquake prompted a tsunami warning Monday for a nearly thousand-mile stretch of Alaska’s southern coast, with waves over 2 feet at the nearest community as the threat subsided. The quake was centered near Sand Point, a city of about 900 people off the Alaska Peninsula where wave levels late Monday topped 2 feet (0.61 meters), according to the National Tsunami Warning Center. The warning was downgraded to an advisory just over two hours after the quake hit. “It was a pretty good shaker here,” said David Adams, co-manager of Marine View Bed and Breakfast in Sand Point. “You could see the water kind of shaking and shimmering during the quake. Our truck was swaying big time.” Adams didn’t take any photos or video: “It just kind of happened all of a sudden.” The quake struck in the North Pacific Ocean just before 1 p.m. It was centered about 67 miles (118 kilometers) southeast of Sand Point, according to the Alaska Earthquake Center. The community is about 800 miles (1,288 km) southwest of Anchorage. The quake was recorded at a depth of 19 miles (30 kilometers). The National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, Alaska, said the tsunami warning — and later advisory — was in effect for roughly 950 miles (1,529 kilometers), from 40 miles (64 kilometers) southeast of Homer to Unimak Pass, about 80 miles (129 km) northeast of Unalaska. The quake was felt widely in communities along the southern coast, including Sand Point, Chignik, Unalaska and the Kenai Peninsula, according to the Alaska Earthquake Center, which said a magnitude 5.2 aftershock was reported 11 minutes later, centered roughly in the same area. Patrick Mayer, superintendent of the Aleutians East Borough School District, said parents picked up their children from Sand Point School, which also served an evacuation point. The earthquake was felt to varying degrees at the other four schools in the district, the closest of which is 90 miles away, he said. Mayer said a school bus was dispatched to a fish processing facility to bring workers to the school since it’s on high ground. The workers were to wear masks to protect against the spread of the coronavirus, he said, in a community where there have been only “limited cases.” Public safety officials in King Cove urged residents to remain vigilant after the warning was downgraded and to stay off the beach and out of harbors and marinas. Waves by late afternoon in King Cove were less than 2 feet (0.61 meters), according to the National Tsunami Warning Center. The size of the quake was originally reported to have been a magnitude of 7.4, but was revised to a 7.5, said Paul Caruso, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey. He said an earthquake of this size, in this area, is not a surprise. “This is an area where the Pacific Plate is subducting underneath the North American Plate. And because of that, the Pacific Plate actually goes underneath the North American Plate, where it melts,” Caruso said, noting that’s why there are volcanoes in the region. “And so we commonly have large, magnitude 7 earthquakes in that area.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The quake Monday was first reported as magnitude-7.4 and was revised to a 7.5 before the latest revision. There was no major damage from the quake or tsunami. Don Blakeman, a geophysicist with the National Earthquake Information Center, said magnitudes are calculated using various mathematical formulas. He said revisions can occur as agencies contribute information or add more analysis.

But the threat is not over. Scientists said the melting glaciers in Alaska region could unleash a 'mega-tsunami,' with a destructive high wall of water. As per the scientists, the glacier retreat in Prince William Sound—a narrow sea channel on the south coast of the U.S. state of Alaska—is now destabilizing mountain slopes and a massive tsunami could appear as early as 2021. A group of experts in an open letter to Alaskan authorities said that collapsing mountain slopes in Alaska caused 633 feet high waves in 2015. The researchers also noted that in west Greenland, a landslide in June 2017 produced a tsunami that killed four people and destroyed a large portion of the town of Nuugaatsiaq. According to the findings, the tsunami could impact areas frequently visited by tourists, fishing vessels, and hunters. The team of scientists believes that there is a possibility that this landslide-led tsunami ""will happen within the next year, and likely within 20 years.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

earthquake,,"7.7-magnitude earthquake generates small South Pacific tsunami NOUMEA: A 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck in the South Pacific on Thursday (Feb 11), generating a small tsunami that caused no damage to island nations in the region before authorities gave the all clear. The quake struck at just after midnight on Thursday local time (9.20pm on Wednesday, Singapore time) about 415 kilometres east of Vao in New Caledonia at a depth of 10 kilometres, according to the US Geological Survey. The US government's NWS Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said ""hazardous tsunami waves"" were forecast for some coasts. It said waves reaching between 0.3 and one metre above the tide level were possible for Fiji, New Zealand and Vanuatu. A wave of 0.3 metres struck Fiji, according to the Twitter feed of the island nation's seismology department. However, Fiji Seismology later cancelled its tsunami warning. ""The seismology observatory upon its assessments has now verified and confirmed the cancellation of the warning and 'all clear information' (is) issued to the whole Fiji group,"" it said. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology confirmed in a tweet that a tsunami had been generated. The bureau warned of a threat to Lord Howe Island, which is about 550 kilometres east of Australia's mainland, but said there was no need for evacuations. Locals in the Vanuatu capital Port Vila said they felt the quake but there was no damage from either the shake or subsequent waves. The New Zealand National Emergency Management Agency warned of ""strong and unusual currents"" in northern coastal areas but said there was no tsunami risk. ""There isn't a threat to land so we haven't issued a tsunami alert,"" the disaster agency's acting director Roger Ball told Radio New Zealand. He advised those in affected areas to ""stay out of the water and stay off the beaches"" but said the danger posed was not enough to warrant a nationwide warning. ""Waking everybody up at 4:00 or 5:00 am in the morning with emergency mobile alerts we didn't feel was a proportionate response,"" he said. There were no initial reports of casualties or damage from the tsunami or the quake, which was initially recorded by USGS at magnitude 7.5 before being revised to 7.7. The Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", where tectonic plates collide, experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity. In 2018, a 7.5-magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami on Indonesia's Sulawesi island left more than 4,300 people dead or missing. A 9.1-magnitude quake struck off the coast of Indonesia's Sumatra island in 2004, triggering a tsunami that killed 220,000 throughout the region.

Typhoon,"Super Typhoon Goni, world’s most powerful storm in four years, smashes into the Philippines","MANILA — Super Typhoon Goni, the world's most powerful storm in four years, crashed through the Philippines on Sunday, smashing buildings, toppling trees, and causing floods and mudslides. At least 10 people were reported dead as of Monday morning.
Peak winds were estimated at 195 mph early Sunday before Goni slammed into Catanduanes Island, home to more than 260,000 people. Those winds, equivalent to those of a strong Category 5 hurricane, made the storm comparable to Super Typhoon Haiyan, the catastrophic cyclone that devastated Tacloban City in the Philippines in 2013 and killed more than 6,000 people. The winds were similar to those of Typhoon Meranti, which struck the Philippines in 2016.
Goni landed in a country already reeling from two typhoons in the past two weeks, the coronavirus pandemic, a recession and a record unemployment rate this year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,Typhoon Goni: Philippines hit by year's most powerful storm,"Typhoon Goni is barrelling across the Philippines, bringing with it ""catastrophic"" winds and rain.
At least 10 people have died amid reports of storm surges, flash floods, power outages and blown-off roofs.
Goni made landfall as a super typhoon at Catanduanes island on Sunday at 04:50 local time (19:50 GMT Saturday) packing winds of 225km/h (140mph).
It has since weakened, but is still wreaking damage across the main Luzon island, home to the capital Manila.
President Rodrigo Duterte is monitoring the disaster response from his home in Davao city, a presidential spokesman said.
Mark Timbal of the Philippines' national disaster agency said that 19 million people may have been affected by the path of Goni. ""This 19 million already includes the populations in danger zones for landslides, flooding, storm surges and even a lava flow,"" he told the BBC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its the Philippines’ nineteenth named storm for year 2020. Typhoon Goni is considered as the strongest landfalling tropical cyclone in world recorded history.
At its peak strength on landfall on Catanduanes and Albay, Super Typhoon Goni caused widespread damage to high-risk structures and almost total damage to structures made of light materials in the highly exposed coastal areas. Many roof failures were observed in houses and industrial buildings. Electrical power distribution and communication services were severely disrupted. Water systems were severely damaged. Agriculture and livelihoods were severely affected. In one area, on the slopes, of Mayon Volcano there was a lahar flow that caused the near total destruction of one village.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,Typhoon could hit Port of Hong Kong this weekend,"Hong Kong may have to brace for a typhoon slamming its large container port this weekend.
A cluster of thunderstorms over the Philippines has the potential to become a typhoon during the next couple of days. This would be the second named storm of the 2020 Pacific typhoon season. The first was Typhoon Vongfong, known as Typhoon Ambo in the Philippines, which hit that island nation in May. The season runs throughout the year, but most Pacific typhoons develop from May through October.
This storm, which would be named Typhoon Nuri, will likely track over the northern Philippines on Friday, June 12, moving into southeastern China over the weekend. The projected track takes the storm close to Hong Kong on Sunday, June 14.
The potential typhoon could delay various services, from container cargo to cruises and public transportation.
Hong Kong is one of the busiest container ports in the world, according to the Hong Kong Maritime and Port Board website. It handled 18.3 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) of containers in 2019, and provided about 300 container liner services per week connecting to around 420 destinations worldwide.The Port of Hong Kong is also home to cruise liners and government fleets, and it operates ferries between Hong Kong and mainland China.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,Typhoon Nuri lands in Hong Kong,"Typhoon Nuri weakened to a severe tropical storm as it landed in Hong Kong on Friday, bringing strong winds and rainfall but inflicting little damage.
No major destruction was reported, unlike in the Philippines, where Nuri killed seven people and triggered landslides and floods in the north.
But with Nuri landing in Hong Kong late Friday afternoon, the Hong Kong Observatory said it had weakened from a typhoon to a severe tropical storm. By late Friday night, the storm was headed northwest toward the southern Chinese city Guangzhou.
In Hong Kong, a man went missing while swimming off a local beach and 11 people were injured during the storm, with three in serious condition, the government said in a statement.
There also were reports of toppled trees, collapsed walls and scaffoldings.
The Hong Kong Observatory issued its second-highest tropical cyclone warning.
Flights, bus and ferry services were canceled, and offices, schools and financial markets were closed. At least 388 passenger flights were either canceled or delayed and another 15 diverted, the government said in a statement.
Officials have evacuated 87,000 people and recalled more than 45,000 vessels in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.

Typhoon,Typhoon Nuri barrels into Hong Kong,"Typhoon Nuri lashed Hong Kong with heavy rain and strong winds sparking major flight delays, disruption to public transport and a halt to trade on the city's financial markets.
Many offices in the southern Chinese territory were closed, and ferry services suspended as meteorologists issued the level-eight storm signal, signifying the likelihood of gale-force winds.
At 11:00 am, the typhoon was centred about 100 kilometres (60 miles) east-southeast of Hong Kong and was moving towards the city at a speed of about 14 kilometres an hour.
""Nuri will be rather close to Hong Kong this afternoon and ON Friday night with a chance of a direct hit,"" a spokesman for the Hong Kong Observatory said.
Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacific and its sister company Dragonair announced that all flights would be cancelled for 12 hours starting at 2:00 pm (0600 GMT).

The storm — known as Tropical Storm Nuri in China — will travel across the South China Sea this weekend, maintaining tropical storm status. As of 11 a.m. EDT Friday (11 p.m. Friday Hong Kong time), its sustained winds were 40 mph, with gusts of 50.
The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has issued a T1 tropical cyclone warning. This indicates that a tropical cyclone is centered within 500 miles (800 km) of Hong Kong, which may affect the city and its ports.
Winds and swells in Hong Kong are expected to gradually increase Saturday. The HKO will consider issuing the T3 strong wind warning depending on how badly conditions deteriorate. Meteorologists with the HKO are predicting gale force winds up to 54 mph for Saturday, flirting with severe tropical storm status (55 to 73 mph).

Typhoon,"Hurricane Iota Makes Landfall In Nicaragua, Region Braces For 'Catastrophic' Impact","Hurricane Iota has made landfall in Nicaragua as a Category 4 storm, with the Central American region bracing for the possibility of catastrophic damage.
Iota crossed into Nicaragua near the town of Haulover, approximately 15 miles south of where Hurricane Eta also struck as a Category 4 on Nov. 3.
Nicaragua, along with Honduras, Guatemala, and southern Belize, which are flanked by the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean, are still trying to recover from the widespread devastation caused by Hurricane Eta, which left tens of thousands homeless.
At the time, Eta was the strongest storm to ever hit Nicaragua in the month of November.
The National Hurricane Center has warned of ""catastrophic winds, life-threatening storm surge, and torrential rainfall"" across Central America from the latest storm.
When it made landfall, Iota had sustained winds of 155 mph _ a Category 4 hurricane, but by 4 a.m. ET, it had lost strength, becoming a Category 2 storm, with winds at 105 mph, according to the U.S.-based National Hurricane Center. The storm was centered about 10 miles east-northeast of El Pia, Nicaragua. Before making landfall, Iota reached Category 5 for a time.
Besides Iota's incredible strong winds — expected to rip apart roofs and shatter some buildings completely — it is also bringing a massive storm surge, rain and flooding. Water is always the biggest killer in any tropical event and this will be no exception; Iota is a ""bigger"" storm than Eta in terms of how wide the windfield is. That means more people will feel the effects of the storm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,Hurricane Iota Now a ‘Catastrophic’ Category 5 Storm,"U.S. forecasters say Hurricane Iota has strengthened to a catastrophic Category 5 storm as it nears landfall with Nicaragua.
In its latest report, the National Hurricane Center says Iota is closing in on Nicaragua, where it is expected to bring “catastrophic winds, life-threatening storm surge, and torrential rainfall.”
Iota, currently packing maximum sustained winds of 260 kilometers per hour, is expected to make landfall in almost the exact location where Hurricane Eta came ashore two weeks ago.
Authorities in Honduras and Nicaragua rushed to evacuate their respective citizens from coastal areas Monday ahead of the storm.
""What's drawing closer is a bomb,"" Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez said at a news conference alongside Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei.
Hurricane Eta killed at least 50 people, destroyed buildings, knocked out power and caused flooding and landslides.
Iota is the record-breaking 30th named storm of the 2020 hurricane season. Along with Eta, it marks the first time that two major hurricanes have formed in the month of November.
It is also the 10th named storm to strengthen by more than 55.5 kph in a 24-hour period. Meteorologists attribute the effect to warm waters in the southern Caribbean.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Typhoon,Unsurvivable surge': Laura makes landfall on Texas-Louisiana border,"Galveston, Texas: Hurricane Laura made landfall near Cameron in Louisiana on Thursday afternoon (AEST) as one of the region's worst hurricanes, threatening to devastate the US Gulf Coast with catastrophic storm surges, flash floods and powerful winds that could leave areas uninhabitable for weeks or months.
It came ashore as a category four storm with maximum winds of about 240km/h, according to the National Hurricane Centre. Laura is strong enough to rip down houses, uproot trees and cause power outages that could last weeks or even months.The storm is set to push a wall of water more than 6.1 metres high in some places on to shore, with potentially deadly effects - a catastrophic surge the centre earlier described as ""unsurvivable"".
It could inflict more than US15 billion (20 billion) in insured losses.
It is just a few kilometres per hour short of the most powerful storm category possible, and it's matching the previous record-breaker, the Lost Island Hurricane of 1856.
Some additional strengthening is possible before Laura reaches the north-west US Gulf of Mexico coast, the centre said. It's coming with more power than Hurricane Harvey when it made landfall in Texas in 2017.

Typhoon,,"Thick mud and debris coated many villages around the Philippine capital on Friday after a typhoon killed at least 42 people and caused extensive flooding that sent people fleeing to their roofs, officials said.
Troops, police, coast guard and disaster-response teams rescued tens of thousands of people, including many who flooded radio and TV networks and social media with desperate pleas for help.
Floodwaters receded and the weather cleared in many areas after Typhoon Vamco blew out into the South China Sea on Friday, but the military said it was still rescuing people trapped in some flooded communities.
Amphibious assault vehicles usually used in counter-insurgency operations were deployed for the rescue work, military chief of staff Gen. Gilbert Gapay said in a meeting with disaster-response officials.
“We’ll continue to look for the missing, help in damage assessment,” Gapay said.
The national police reported that the death toll had risen to at least 42 with 20 missing. The government’s main disaster-response agency, which waits for provincial reports and follows a laborious process of verifying casualties, reported a much lower death count, causing confusion.
Among the dead were at least 12 villagers who were dug out from mud and rockslides in the northern provinces of Cagayan and Nueva Vizcaya, police said.
After slamming into northeastern Quezon province, Vamco gained strength with sustained winds of 155 kilometers (96 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 255 kph (158 mph). It blew north of metropolitan Manila overnight Wednesday, toppling trees and power poles, swelling rivers, flooding residential communities and setting off landslides and storm surges.
In hard-hit Marikina city in the capital region and the towns of Rodriguez and Cainta in nearby Rizal province, several villages were inundated by water that reached the second and third floors of many houses, prompting hundreds of residents to flee to their roofs and call TV and radio networks or post desperate messages on social media. The panic was exacerbated by widespread power outages and loss of internet access.
Videos of Marikina showed a thick coat of muddy water covering roads and staining houses and cars. Residents carried appliances and furniture from their homes and used pails and shovels to remove the mud after the water receded.

Typhoon,,"A typhoon swelled rivers and flooded low-lying areas as it passed over the storm-battered northeastern Philippines, leaving at least 13 people dead and 15 others missing, officials said Thursday.
The Philippine National Police reported the casualty figures, but gave no details.
Typhoon Vamco passed north of Manila between Bulacan and Pampanga provinces, toppling trees and knocking out power. Officials said earlier that nearly 200,000 people had been evacuated, some forcibly, from vulnerable coastal and low-lying areas.
Officials said about 1.9 million households were without power in Metro Manila and nearby provinces. Many electricity poles were toppled, power lines were knocked down and power transformers were damaged.
President Rodrigo Duterte took a break from an online summit of Southeast Asian leaders to fly by helicopter over the affected areas.
“As president I guarantee you that your government will do its best to provide assistance in the form of shelters, relief goods, financial aid and post-disaster counseling. Rest assured, the government will not leave anybody behind. We will get through this crisis,” Duterte said in a televised address.
Rescue teams were deployed to flooded areas in Rizal province, coast guard chief Adm. George Ursabia told DZBB radio.
Marikina city Mayor Marcie Teodoro said fierce winds knocked down power lines overnight, leaving many areas without power and internet service. Heavy rains also flooded many areas and the Marikina River was swollen. Many people in Marikina city were waiting to be rescued from roofs.
“There are many areas that historically don’t get flooded but now they are swamped, like city hall,” he told DZBB radio.
Mark Timbal, spokesman for the government’s disaster response agency, said 363 rescue teams had been deployed consisting of 1,000 rescuers with at least 40 rubber boats.
The typhoon had maximum sustained winds of 130 kilometers per hour (80 mph) with stronger gusts Thursday morning. It was moving west-northwest at 30 kph (19 mph) and was headed for the South China Sea.
The government’s main disaster-response agency had pleaded to the media to relay typhoon alerts in northeastern areas devastated by an earlier typhoon, Goni, saying the agency’s messages could not be sent by cellphones due to damaged telecommunications systems.
Goni, one of the strongest typhoons in the world this year, left more than 30 people dead or missing and damaged or destroyed more than 270,000 houses, many in coastal villages. Tens of thousands of people remain displaced.

Typhoon,,"At least 20 people were killed as Typhoon Goni lashed the Philippines over the weekend, and about 13,000 shanties and houses were damaged or swept away in the eastern island province that was first hit by the ferocious storm, officials said Monday.
Goni blasted into Catanduanes province at dawn Sunday as a super typhoon with sustained winds of 225 kilometers (140 miles) per hour and gusts of 280 kph (174 mph). But it weakened considerably after making landfall and shifted direction to spare the capital, Manila, before blowing out into the South China Sea.
The Office of Civil Defense said at least 20 people were killed in Catanduanes and nearby Albay province.
Catanduanes, an island province of more than 260,000 people that is often lashed by Pacific storms, was isolated after losing power and communications due to Goni and another typhoon that had hit a week earlier. But officials there managed to connect to the outside world on Monday after disaster-response authorities flew to the devastated island with satellite phones.
Catanduanes Gov. Joseph Cua and other officials said the typhoon whipped up 5-meter (16-foot) storm surges and damaged or swept away about 13,000 houses. Many residents fled to safety from their homes as the typhoon approached.
More than 66,000 other houses and huts were damaged elsewhere in the region, officials said.
Cua described the onslaught as “severe” and reported that some coastal areas were swamped by frightening storm surges.
About 80% of the electricity posts on the island were toppled and roads linking the province’s 11 towns remained impassable, Cua said.
An army general on the island appealed for more troops to help distribute food packs and water to residents. He added that the army camp was destroyed by the typhoon and soldiers have camped out at the airport, which remained open.
An air force cargo plane was to deliver food packs, drinking water, blankets and other relief goods to the province.
The typhoon also devastated the nearby province of Albay, where heavy rains washed down boulders and mudflows from Mayon Volcano, engulfing about 150 houses in a single community in the town of Guinobatan, Albay Gov. Al Francis Bichara said.",https://apnews.com/article/typhoons-south-china-sea-philippines-storms-typhoon-goni-90748529b120afdab9b041d64af1f043,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"A super typhoon blew into the eastern Philippines with disastrous force Sunday, killing at least 10 people and triggering volcanic mudflows that engulfed about 150 houses before weakening as it blew away from the country, officials said.
Typhoon Goni blasted into the eastern island province of Catanduanes at dawn from the Pacific with sustained winds of 225 kilometers (140 miles) per hour and gusts of 280 kph (174 mph), threatening some provinces still recovering from a deadly typhoon that hit a week ago.
Goni barreled through densely populated regions and threatened to sideswipe Manila, which shut down its main airport, but shifted southward Sunday night and spared the capital, the government weather agency said.
At least nine people were killed in the hard-hit province of Albay, including a father and son. Villagers fled to safety as the typhoon approached, but the two apparently stayed put in the community in Guinobatan town where about 150 houses were inundated by volcanic mudflow.
“The child was found 15 kilometers (9 miles) away,” Albay Gov. Al Francis Bichara told DZMM radio, adding that the boy was swept away by mudflows and found in the next town.
He did not say whether there were any other residents trapped by the rampaging mudflows in the community and added that downed communications made it hard for people to communicate. The Office of Civil Defense reported that three Guinobatan residents were missing, but it was not immediately clear if they were from the mudflow-hit community.
The other deaths in Albay included a villager who was pinned by a fallen tree. One person was killed in Catanduanes province.

Ricardo Jalad, who heads the government’s disaster-response agency, had feared that the typhoon could wreak major damage due to its enormous force. The Philippine weather agency reinforced those concerns, saying that within 12 hours after the typhoon’s landfall, people could face “catastrophic, violent winds and intense to torrential rainfall.”
Residents were warned of possible landslides, massive flooding, storm surges of up to 5 meters (16 feet) and powerful winds that can blow away shanties. But after hitting a mountain range and repeatedly slamming into coastal provinces, the typhoon gradually weakened, although it remained potentially deadly as it blew out into the South China Sea, forecasters said.

Typhoon,,"China issued its top warning for coastal areas of Zhejiang province Friday ahead of a strong typhoon carrying heavy rain and winds and expected to send an intense storm surge up the mighty Yangzte River.
Heavy rain was expected in Zhejiang, Shanghai and nearby provinces on Friday before Typhoon Lekima hits land on Saturday morning, then weakens as it moves north.
Parts of northern Taiwan closed offices and suspended classes at schools on Friday as the storm passed northeast of the island. The same area was hit by a magnitude 6.0 earthquake Thursday that caused minor damage but no deaths or injuries.
The red alert China issued is the most serious in its four-tired alert system, prompting authorities to prepare evacuations, suspend train and air travel and require vessels to return to port. In Zhejiang, ferry service had been cancelled and more than 200 tourists evacuated from popular Beiji island.
The National Meteorological Center said Lekima was gusting at 209 kph (130 mph) and traveling northwesterly at 13 kph (8 mph). Taiwan’s Central Weather Bureau put its sustained winds at 173 kph (108 mph) and said the bands of wind and rains around the storm’s eye were shrinking.
The State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters warned authorities overseeing seven provinces including Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangsu and Shanghai Municipality to make preparations and have emergency response systems ready to be deployed. In Zhejiang, nearly 5,000 fishing boats had been recalled to port, authorities reported.
An intense storm surge was expected to raise waters in the estuary of the Yangzte River, China’s mightiest, beginning Friday. Three main streams of the Yangzte River are likely to exceed alert levels and the commission overseeing the river for the Ministry of Water Resources has ordered efforts to prevent floods and oversaturation of levees along the river’s banks.",https://apnews.com/article/ap-top-news-international-news-shanghai-storms-typhoons-e5545b68614a469e856d45abb882d40f,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Typhoon,,"Hurricane Delta, which made landfall about 11 miles (about 18 kilometers) from where the devastating Hurricane Laura hit a little more than a month earlier, cost 2.9 billion in the United States and was linked to six deaths in the U.S. and Mexico, according to a report from the National Hurricane Center.
The report released Tuesday details the hurricane’s origins, trajectory and things such as wind speed and storm surge when it made landfall in southwestern Louisiana.
The Center releases similar reports on every named storm that hits during a season. The reports on some of the 2020 season’s most devastating hurricanes - including Laura, Iota and Zeta - have yet to be published.
In the United States, two people died as a direct result of Delta — a 19-year-old woman and a 49-year-old man who both drowned in rip currents near Destin, Florida — and there were two indirect deaths associated with electrocutions and fires. In Mexico, there were two indirect deaths — an electrocution and a fall — linked to the hurricane.
The Center classifies deaths as direct or indirect. Direct deaths are those considered directly tied to the storm such as drowning in storm surge or being in a house that collapses from wind. Someone who dies of a heart attack during a storm or is electrocuted by a downed power line, for example, is considered an indirect death.
The hurricane came ashore as a Category 2 storm with winds of 97 miles per hour (156 miles per hour) and produced a storm surge that got up to nine feet (2.7 meters) in some areas east of where it made landfall near Creole, the report said. While Laura’s earlier damage came through devastating winds, Delta produced huge rain totals in some areas particularly between Lake Charles and Alexandria. Nearly 18 inches of rain fell in LeBleu Settlement northeast of Lake Charles, the report said.
The Center also released a report Tuesday on Hurricane Marco. That storm, which came days before the much more destructive Laura made landfall on August 27, was originally thought to have made landfall at the mouth of the Mississippi River on Aug. 24 based on satellite imagery. But in the report, the Center said further research suggests it stayed just south and did not actually make landfall. There were no reports of casualties linked to the storm and only minor damage.
The 2020 Atlantic hurricane season set multiple records while producing a record 30 named storms. There were so many that the list of 21 conventional names was exhausted and the Greek alphabet was used for only the second time. The season also saw the second-highest number of hurricanes on record after 13 of the storms reached hurricane status.",https://apnews.com/article/mexico-storms-hurricane-laura-hurricane-delta-hurricanes-c6c8503b057ab46d52bfc931d5b1766c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nicaragua Vice President and first lady Rosario Murillo on Wednesday raised the nation’s death toll to 16. The victims were spread across the country, swept away by swollen rivers or buried in landslides.
Rescuers searched at the site of a landslide in northern Nicaragua, where the local government confirmed four deaths and neighbors spoke of at least 16. A short video from the nation’s emergency management agency showed a massive bowl-shaped mountainside shrouded in clouds that collapsed. Police blocked media access to the site on the Macizo de Pe?as Blancas, a mountain in Matagalpa province, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) north of Managua.
There were seven confirmed dead at the mountain, and the search continued, Murillo said.
Miguel Rodríguez, who works on a ranch next to the site, said he saw at least seven bodies.
“The landslide came with all the dirt, and it became like a river going down. It took all of the little houses that were there. There were five homes, five families,” Rodríguez said.

Iota had intensified into an extremely dangerous Category 5 storm early in the day, but the U.S. National Hurricane Center said it weakened slightly to Category 4, with maximum sustained winds of 155 mph (250 kph). Its center made landfall about 30 miles (45 kilometers) south of the Nicaraguan city of Puerto Cabezas, also known as Bilwi.
Iota already had been hitting the Caribbean coasts of Nicaragua and Honduras with torrential rains and strong winds.
Iota came ashore just 15 miles (25 kilometers) south of where Hurricane Eta made landfall Nov. 3, also as a Category 4 storm. Eta’s torrential rains saturated the soil in the region, leaving it prone to new landslides and floods, and that the storm surge could reach 15 to 20 feet (4.5 to 6 meters) above normal tides.
In Bilwi, business owner Adán Artola Schultz braced himself in the doorway of his house as strong gusts of wind and rain drover water in torrents down the street. He watched in amazement as wind ripped away the metal roof structure from a substantial two-story home and blew it away like paper.
“It is like bullets,” he said of the sound of metal structures banging and buckling in the wind. “This is double destruction,” he said, referring to the damages wrought by Eta just 12 days earlier.
“This is coming in with fury,” said Artola Schultz.

The storm arrived as a Category 2 hurricane in Gulf Shores, Alabama, around 4.45am with 105mph winds and rain depths in the feet, not inches, flooding homes and streets _ as people were forced to evacuate from the southern coast.
Some areas have already been hit with 24 inches of rain, and a total of 35 inches could come in parts of Florida and Alabama, according to the National Weather Service. Why specific areas were getting hammered with high rains was due, in part, to how slowly the storm was moving. It was traveling at just 7mph up the coastal states.
First responders used boats and high water vehicles in parts of Florida and Alabama to rescue hundreds of trapped residents while Hurricane Sally transformed into a tropical storm, with winds decreasing to 70mph.
The rescues came after some of the areas hit the hardest were not issued mandatory evacuations. Residents were encouraged to voluntarily leave, but some people still stayed behind in their homes.

The storm is moving to the north-northeast on a track across central and north Louisiana that is expected to continue through Saturday morning, forecasters said.
The system is expected to become a tropical depression by later Saturday as it moves across northern Mississippi into the Tennessee Valley.
THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE: AP’s earlier story appears below.
Ripping tarps from already damaged roofs and scattering debris piled by roadsides, Hurricane Delta inflicted a new round of destruction on Louisiana as it struck communities still reeling after Hurricane Laura took a similar path just six weeks earlier.
Delta hit as a Category 2 hurricane, with top winds of 100 mph (155 kph) but rapidly grew weaker. It dwindled within hours to a weak Category 1 storm with 75 mph (120 kph) winds. Still, forecasters warned of danger from storm surge and flash floods across much of southwestern Louisiana and parts of neighboring Texas.
Delta made landfall Friday evening near the coastal town of Creole — a distance of only about 15 miles (24 kilometers) from where Laura struck land in August, killing 27 people in Louisiana. The earlier storm damaged nearly every home and building in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Piles of moldy mattresses, sawed-up trees and other debris still lined the streets.
Mayor Nic Hunter said tarps were flying off homes across the city.
“I’m in a building right now with a tarp on it and just the sound of the tarp flapping on the building sounds like someone pounding with a sledgehammer on top of the building,“ Hunter said as he rode out the storm downtown. ”It’s pretty intense.”
In Lake Charles, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland from where Delta came ashore, water leaked through the ceiling of Ernest Jack's bedroom as he tried to sleep Friday night. Jack said the tarp cover the roof damage caused by Laura hadn’t blown off. His windows were covered to protect against flying debris.
“It’s raining real hard; it’s flooding; the wind is strong,” Jack said Friday night. “I’m OK. I’m not worried about nothing, just praying that everything goes well.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/delta-inflicts-new-damage-on-stormweary-louisiana-delta-louisiana-track-depression-damage-b929354.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two people were confirmed on Sunday to have been killed after Delta made landfall on Friday evening near the coastal town of Creole, with top winds of 100mph. 
Delta on Friday and Saturday moved over Lake Charles, a city where Hurricane Laura damaged nearly every home and building in late August.
Aerial photographs showed the destruction around Creole, with roofs torn from buildings and communities surrounded by floodwater.
John Bel Edwards, the governor of Louisiana, said the storm dumped more than 15 inches of rain on Lake Charles over two days, and more than 10 inches on Baton Rouge.

“It’s hard to come back and see it again and then to know there’s another (hurricane) that’s out there,” Vincent, of Cameron told The Advertiser of Lafayette. “It’s tough.”
She said people leave with every hurricane that batters Louisiana's lightly populated southwest coast.
“Yeah, our house is still there, but do you know how lonely this place is going to be?” she said.
Coastal Cameron Parish had about 9,800 residents when Hurricane Rita hit in 2005. The next census, in 2010, found about 6,800 people in the parish, Louisiana's equivalent of a county elsewhere.
“I don’t know what’ll happen now, with these two storms,” said Scott Trahan, vice president of the parish police jury.
Hurricane Laura made landfall in Cameron on Aug. 27 and Delta came in Friday near Creole, just 13 miles (21 kilometers) to the east, where Trahan lives.
“Everywhere you look it's destruction around here,” he said in a phone interview Monday with The Associated Press. “Leave Cameron Parish and go into Calcasieu it's bad there too. You can run from the water but you can't run from the winds.”
The Army Corps of Engineers said Monday that it is still installing tarps on homes damaged by Hurricane Laura, and will check on and replace if needed those already installed and then hit by Delta in Allen, Beauregard, Calcasieu, Cameron, Jefferson Davis and Vernon parishes. “ALL eligible homeowners within the six affected parishes are eligible to sign-up for a FREE temporary roof ... through Oct. 24,” a news release said.

Typhoon,,"Another busy hurricane season appears likely, although it won’t be as bad as last year, according to a prediction released Wednesday by AccuWeather, a private weather forecasting service.
The prediction calls for seven to 10 hurricanes. Three to five of these are expected to reach major hurricane strength, which means winds of at least 111 mph.
“Current indications are this will be another above-normal season,” said Dan Kottlowski, AccuWeather’s lead hurricane forecaster. “This can translate into high impacts on the United States.”
The season still is unlikely to be as busy as last year’s record-breaking season, which generated 30 storms, including 13 hurricanes, subjecting the United States to 12 direct hits and exhausting the storm names selected for that year.
But the danger to the U.S. east coast may be higher this year because of the weakening of the Bermuda high, a high-pressure zone that last year stiff-armed many storms into the Gulf of Mexico. This year, the Bermuda high’s rim could be farther northeast, allowing storms to curve north earlier and strike the east coast.
The Accu-Weather forecast cited warm Atlantic temperatures as one factor in the prediction of an active season.

Typhoon,,"There has been a lull in tropical activity around the globe for the beginning of September, with most of the activity occurring in the Atlantic.

For now, the main focus is across the western North Pacific Ocean where a super typhoon has its eyes set for parts of South Korea and the Japanese island of Okinawa. The good news about Super Typhoon Sanba is that it will likely gradually weaken as it pushes to the north. However, the storm will likely pack a punch across South Korea.
Sanba, which was the 17th tropical depression to form in the western North Pacific Ocean developed on September 11, 2012. Within two days, Sanba hit ideal conditions to strengthen into a Category 5 hurricane, which we call a “Super Typhoon” in the western Pacific. “Super-typhoon” is a term utilized by the U.S. Joint Typhoon Warning Center for typhoons that reach maximum sustained 1-minute surface winds around 130 knots or 150 miles per hour. If you compare this to the Saffir-Simpson scale, it would be a very strong category 4 or 5 hurricane in the Atlantic basin. Yesterday, Sanba moved over very warm waters and was able to develop maximum sustained winds of 175 mph with gusts approximately around 200 mph. Just as a reference to give you an idea how strong Sanba truly is, an EF-4 tornado has sustained winds around 168-199 mph. Fortunately, systems that gain such a large increase in strength tend to weaken and undergoes an eye wall replacement cycle.

Chosun Central News Agency reported on the approach of ‘Typhoon Bolaven’ this afternoon, saying, “Typhoon-15 is now moving northwestward at a velocity of 12km/h, as of 09:00 Thursday.”
“It is expected to come to the sea off Shanghai, China on around August 27th and move northward along the west coastal area of Korea before reaching the Chinese northeastern region on the evening of August 28th. The typhoon-15 will trigger strong wind and heavy rains in overall areas of Korea on August 27th and 28th,” the brief report added.
According to South Korea’s meteorological authorities, meanwhile, Typhoon Bolaven was 460km south of Sogwipo, the largest city on the south coast of Jeju Island, at 12PM today, moving at 34km/h in a north-northwesterly direction. It appears set to make landfall over Hwanghae Province in North Korea late on the afternoon of the 28th.

Typhoon,,"Hurricane Hanna, the first hurricane of the season, makes landfall in Texas Hurricane Hanna, the first hurricane of the 2020 Atlantic tropical storm season, saw its sustained winds reaching 90mph before making landfall on the Texas coastline late yesterday. Post-landfall update towards the foot of this article. Hanna was a tropical storm on Friday and while it was expected to strengthen it was only given a low probability of reaching hurricane status. But hurricane Hanna defied some of the forecast models, to become the first hurricane of the 2020 Atlantic season on Saturday and intensify further as it moved towards the Texas coastline. Insurance, reinsurance and ILS market interests may have had a closer eye on tropical storm Gonzalo as yesterday forecasts suggested it could make it through the Caribbean, but now that storm is dissipating and hurricane Hanna has become the one to watch. Hurricane Hanna achieved sustained winds of 90mph with higher gusts to 110mph or more, as it moved slowly towards a landfall in Texas somewhere on the central Padre Island seashore. Hurricane Hanna could have strengthened further and the storms intensity was only limited by the amount of time it had over the warm Gulf waters. The modelled intensity forecast from TropicalTidbits.com showed a continued spike in wind speeds was expected up until landfall. The Texas coastal islands are already experiencing storm surge from hurricane Hanna, while the forecast is for coastal inundation totals of 2 to 6 feet above normal sea levels widely around the landfall region. Corelogic said in an update on hurricane Hanna that more than 14,000 residential properties lie in surge exposed areas near the area of the storms expected landfall. Significant rainfall totals are expected with hurricane Hanna, with the potential for isolated totals of 18 inches or perhaps more and life-threatening flash flood warnings raised for the southern Texas coastal region. Adding to the challenges, hurricane Hanna is coming ashore in a region of Texas where Covid-19 cases have been spiking in recent weeks, raising issues around distancing at evacuation centers should they be needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Hurricane Hanna makes landfall in Texas Hurricane Hanna battered southern Texas with sustained winds of 75 mph and continued to deliver heavy rain and flash flooding as it moved inland late Saturday. The Category 1 hurricane was moving west at about 8 mph when it made landfall at Padre Island, about 15 miles north of Port Mansfield, around 5 p.m. local time on Saturday. Very heavy rain, strong winds and storm surge impacted the south Texas coast, the worst of it south of Corpus Christi, down to the mouth of the Rio Grande River. While wind and storm surge were notable along the coast during the afternoon, very heavy rain and the potential for widespread flash flooding across the Rio Grande Valley was the biggest concern into Saturday night. Rainfall totals over extreme southern Texas to the Mexico border could lead to dangerous flash flooding. ""Any hurricane is an enormous challenge, this challenge is complicated and made even more severe seeing it is sweeping through an area that is the most challenged area in the state for COVID-19,"" said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. ""We cannot allow this hurricane to lead to a more deadly event by stoking COVID-19 leading to more fatalities."" Abbot said disaster declarations have been made in 32 counties. The National Weather Service in Brownsville reported ""significant structural damage"" in nearby Port Mansfield and a gust up to 83 mph. As is usually the case with land-falling tropical systems, isolated tornadoes are possible along the southern Texas coast through Saturday evening. Hanna will begin to rapidly weaken Saturday tonight and Sunday morning as it moves into northern Mexico. However, it will continue to bring widespread heavy rain and the threat of dangerous flash flooding across the Rio Grande Valley even as the wind speeds go down.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Typhoon,,"Hanna is expected to be a hurricane before it makes landfall in Texas Tropical Storm Hanna to bring flooding rain to Texas 01:09 (CNN)The earliest H-named storm ever in the Atlantic basin is gaining strength and forecast to make landfall as a hurricane in Texas on Saturday afternoon or evening. Tropical Storm Hanna is forecast to be a Category 1 hurricane with sustained winds of 75 mph when it makes landfall along the south-central coast of Texas, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida. ""Steady strengthening is forecast for the next 24 hours, and Hanna is expected to become a hurricane before the cyclone makes landfall,"" according to an advisory from the hurricane center. The storm currently has sustained winds of 65 mph that extend 60 miles out from the center as it moves across the Gulf of Mexico toward Texas. ""Storms like Hanna in the Gulf of Mexico are notoriously the hardest to forecast,"" CNN meteorologist Chad Myers says. ""The water is so warm under the storm that rapid intensification can happen at any time, especially overnight when atmospheric shear goes down naturally. "" Shear is the changing of wind speed and direction with height and can inhibit hurricanes from forming. If Hanna strengthens into a hurricane, it will be the first hurricane of the season in the Atlantic. As of 10 p.m. Friday, the storm was 165 miles (270 km) east-southeast of Corpus Christi, Texas. An eye is beginning to form based off radar imagery, the hurricane center said, which means the storm is better organized and developing a stronger core structure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two days after Hurricane Hanna touched down in South Texas, thousands remained without power and communities were grappling with how to deal with the damage caused by flooding and strong winds. The storm, which made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane Saturday evening at Padre Island, packed sustained winds as high as 90 mph before weakening into a tropical storm early Sunday and moving into northern Mexico. It was the first hurricane of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season. Hanna unleashed more than 15 inches of rain in parts of South Texas, resulting in serious flash flooding, according to The Washington Post. Gov. Greg Abbott warned Texans on Sunday that there are continued threats of flash flooding even as rainfall slows, due to overflowing rivers. ""Any additional rainfall will exacerbate these threats, but the State of Texas is ready to respond and protect our fellow Texans,"" he said in a statement. The Federal Emergency Management Agency and President Donald Trump approved a federal emergency declaration in response to Hanna, allowing for some federal assistance and reimbursement for evacuation efforts and shelter support. Abbott previously issued a disaster declaration for 32 counties. Downed power lines and trees have caused road closures across South Texas. As of 1 p.m. Monday, American Electric Power Texas, one of the state's largest electric providers, reported more than 58,000 power outages in Corpus Christi, Laredo and the Rio Grande Valley. Before Hanna made landfall, Corpus Christi Mayor Joe McComb told The Associated Press that the city was prepared to deal with both the pandemic and the hurricane. ""Don't feel like since we've been fighting COVID for five months that we're out of energy or we're out of gas,” he said. “We're not.

According to Mexican newspaper accounts, the bodies of a 7-year-old girl and her mother were found Monday in Saltillo, near Monterrey in northeastern Mexico, after the van they were in ran out of gas and was dragged down an overflowing tributary. They were swept away by the current. Some family members escaped, according to the Mexican papers, including the girl's 11-year-old sister, who reportedly managed to survive by clinging to branches. In the border city of Reynosa, one woman reportedly died after suffering a seizure and drowning in the floodwater left by Hanna. Three children were reported missing in a nearby neighborhood, after they fell from a tree into the water. Texas saw no casualties. After Hanna — the first hurricane of the season before being downgraded to a tropical storm, and then a tropical depression — hit the southwestern part of the state on Saturday, 200,000 locations were left without power. As of Monday morning, AEP Texas reported 60,000 outages remaining. Restoring power was complicated by severe flooding in some areas that limited access to substations, the utility said. Hanna made landfall about 90 miles south of Corpus Christi on Saturday evening, before moving into Mexico. In Texas, it dropped up to 15 inches of rain in some areas and caused extensive flooding and beach erosion. The Texas State Aquarium saw minor damage — mostly debris brought in by the storm surge. And the Bob Hall Pier, a local tourist destination, was damaged for the first time in its 37-year history. A video that circulated widely on social media over the weekend purported to show a section of the southern border wall crashing down in Hanna's high winds. But U.S. Customs and Border Protection told Texas Public Radio that the video appears to be from last month, when wind gusts knocked over several border wall panels at a construction site in New Mexico. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced Sunday that the Federal Emergency Management Agency and President Trump granted the state's request for emergency disaster relief. The state prepared for impact late last week, as hospitals in the area were already strained to near-capacity with coronavirus patients. Houston's deputy director for emergency management said Hurricane Hanna was a test of the state's ability to respond to disaster while trying to limit the spread of the coronavirus.

The storm threatened some minor flooding and rough seas as the system moves off the Southeast seaboard. Arthur formed Saturday in waters off Florida, marking the sixth straight year that a named storm has developed before the official June 1 start of the Atlantic hurricane season. Tropical Storm Arthur crawled closer to the North Carolina coast early Monday, amid threats of some minor flooding and rough seas as the system moves off the Southeast seaboard. Arthur formed Saturday in waters off Florida, marking the sixth straight year that a named storm has developed before the official June 1 start of the Atlantic hurricane season. The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami issued a tropical storm warning for North Carolina’s Outer Banks on Sunday. At 2 a.m. EDT, the storm’s center was located about 185 miles (300 kilometers) south-southwest of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Arthur had top sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kph) and was moving to the north-northeast at 12 mph (19 kph). The hurricane center said Arthur is expected to move near or just east of the coast of North Carolina, where 1-3 inches of rain is expected, on Monday and they turn away from the East Coast on Monday night and Tuesday. By Sunday night, the storm’s swirling outer rain bands were skirting closer to the coast. A tropical storm warning was issued for parts of North Carolina’s coast, from Surf City to Duck, including Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds. Michael Lee, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Newport, North Carolina, said tropical-storm-force winds are possible along the coast, particularly in the Outer Banks. “Otherwise, it’s going to be some heavy rainfall for a large part of eastern North Carolina,” Lee said. “But the main threat that we’re really trying to get out there is that there is enhanced risk for dangerous rip currents both today and tomorrow. So, any folks who want to try to go to the beach and get in the water, we have a high risk out for most of our beaches.” The weather service said eastern North Carolina should prepare for some localized flooding and dangerous marine conditions along the coast. “Minor inundation from storm surge is possible for very low-lying areas adjacent to the ocean, sounds, and rivers, with overwash of dunes and flooding of properties and roadways possible for locations where dune structures are weak,” mainly north of Cape Lookout, the weather service said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Tropical Storm Arthur hits North Carolina coast with rain Tropical Storm Arthur moved out to sea Monday after dumping heavy rain on North Carolina as forecasters warned that the first named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season could continue to whip dangerous surf and rip currents for another day or more along the U.S. East Coast. The storm represented another early start for the Atlantic hurricane season. Arthur formed Saturday in waters off Florida, marking the sixth straight year that a named storm has developed before June 1. By late Monday, storm watches and warnings that had been in effect for parts of the North Carolina coast were canceled. As Arthur’s center passed off North Carolina earlier in the day, a pocket along the coast that includes Newport and Havelock recorded more than 4 inches (10 cm) of rain, according to the National Weather Service. Other areas along the coast saw 2 inches (5 cm) or more, causing some secondary roads to flood. Wind gusts of 40 mph or more (64 kph) were recorded in at least two places on the Outer Banks, the weather service said. The Hurricane Center said Arthur was moving northeast at 16 mph (26 kph) Monday afternoon as its center pulled away from the U.S. mainland. At 5 p.m. EDT, the storm’s center was located about 110 miles (175 kilometers) northeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Arthur had top sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph). Forecasters said Arthur could strengthen some as it moves away from land, but was likely to lose its tropical storm characteristics later Monday or Tuesday. North Carolina Emergency Management Director Mike Sprayberry said that over-wash or standing water had closed a highway on the Outer Banks and another on the mainland. Other secondary roads had flooded. Otherwise, he said conditions were stable and that no other serious problems had been reported to the state. Still, he warned that surf conditions will remain dangerous and advised people to be cautious around the water even as the storm pushes out to sea. “People in the eastern part of our state should remain cautious, especially while driving in areas where water may collect on roads,” he said at a news conference. “Today is not the day to take risks at the beach or in the surf.” Forecasters said rough surf could continue for another day or two. While other pre-June storms may be influenced by warming waters and climate change, Arthur is more of a subtropical system than a traditional named storm, said Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach, who added that its water is cooler than what’s usually needed for storm formation. A lot of these out-of-season storms are weak ones that meteorologists can detect because of satellites and other technology, but comparable storms would have been missed in an earlier era, Klotzbach said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Updated 07:00 BTS Jun 3rd: Tropical storm Cristobal has formed out of a low pressure remnant that formed after a Pacific tropical storm named Amanda crossed over Central American country of Guatemala and crossed Mexico. Once the low pressure remnant emerged over the Bay of Campeche it became a tropical depression and then was soon upgraded to tropical storm Cristobal. Tropical storm Cristobal is currently packing 60 mph sustained winds and higher gusts, with minimum central pressure of 994 mb. Having spent recent hours circling close to the Mexican coastline, Cristobal has shifted southeast and is likely to make landfall crossing the southern Bay of Campeche coast later today. After a time inland, the forecast models show Cristobal moving back north and emerging back over the Bay of Campeche around Thursday night and into Friday. Forecast models then show Cristobal moving steadily north across the Gulf, which does mean it could be the first landfall threat to insurance and reinsurance market interests of the 2020 Atlantic storm season. The storm is now forecast to head slowly out into the Gulf of Mexico after meandering for a time near the shore, with strengthening likely and many forecast models are showing storm Cristobal heading towards the U.S. Gulf Coast and strengthening, with a slim chance currently of reaching hurricane status before its arrival. The immediate threat is severe rainfall to Mexico, with totals of 10 to 20 inches and isolated maximum amounts of 25 inches expected over parts of the Mexican states of Tabasco and Campeche. More broadly, 10 to 15 inches of rain is expected over parts of the Mexican states of Chiapas, Veracruz, Quintana Roo, Yucatan and Oaxaca, while rainfall of 10 to 15 inches, with isolated amounts of 25 inches, is expected along the Pacific coasts of Chiapas, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Some of these Pacific areas have already experienced up to 20 inches of rain, so ground is sodden and there is a risk of life-threatening flash floods and mudslides. After tropical storm Cristobal emerges back into the Gulf there remains significant uncertainty over how well organised it will be and whether it will make it to the U.S., the probability appears to have declined overnight. Many forecast models continue to point towards a more central Gulf Coast landfall scenario, but there is still significant uncertainty and range in the forecast path for Cristobal, as well as in terms of potential intensity.

Typhoon,,"Cristobal becomes the earliest third Atlantic named storm on record (CNN)The 2020 hurricane season is only two days old and is already an active one. Cristobal is now the third named storm of the season. It's the earliest a third named storm has ever formed. 2020 Atlantic Hurricane Season Facts >>> Right now Cristobal is a tropical storm with sustained winds of 40 mph with higher gusts. It is moving to the southwest at 3 mph. On its current track, it is expected to continue to interact with southern Mexico over the next several days. The main risk for this storm will continue to be rain. Ten to 20 inches of rain is possible across the Mexican states of Tabasco, Veracrus and Campeche. There could be isolated amounts of more than 2 feet of rain. Some of the Pacific locations in southern Mexico received 20 inches of rain over the weekend, and could get an additional foot of rain. According to the National Hurricane Center, ""Rainfall in all of these areas may produce life-threatening flash floods and mudslides."" ""The Bay of Campeche is notoriously the warmest part of the Gulf region this time of year,"" said CNN Meteorologist Chad Myers. In fact, sea surface temperatures for this area are running 3-4 degrees Fahrenheit above normal right now, providing a lot of fuel for the storm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tropical Storm Cristobal was spinning in the Bay of Campeche at midday Tuesday. By the end of the week, the system is expected to slowly intensify in the Gulf of Mexico, with some data suggesting the storm could ultimately approach or even make a U.S. landfall. Tropical storm warnings are already up in Mexico from Campeche to Puerto de Veracruz as the system continues to organize, while there is concern closer to home for possible impacts by the weekend, depending on the storm’s track and intensity. The system was declared a “tropical depression” on Monday evening and upgraded to a tropical storm at 12:30 p.m. Eastern. This is the earliest third-named storm to form in the Atlantic basin, with the previous record being Tropical Storm Colin, which formed on June 5, 2016.

Typhoon,,"Tropical Storm Cristobal brings heavy rain and flooding to southern US Tropical Storm Cristobal made landfall on Louisiana’s coastline on Sunday 7 June, but the impacts of the storm were felt far and wide. Rainfall rates of 152.4mm an hour were recorded in Florida resulting in flash flooding destroying cars, as well as a tornado forming in downtown Orlando. Prior to landfall on US soil, Cristobal brought destruction along the Gulf of Mexico, with nearly 328.9mm of rain falling in a 24-hour period causing significant flooding, cutting off communities, and triggering landslides. Cristobal is the third named storm of an already busy Atlantic hurricane season. The start of the monsoon season was officially announced last week in Kerala, India, where favourable conditions for the south-west monsoon have developed. The monsoon season is critical for the agricultural sector, which accounts for approximately 15% India’s economy, playing a vital role in crop irrigation. However, heavy monsoon rains can be hazardous too, bringing the threat of landslides and flash flooding, frequently resulting in the loss of life. In the central Netherlands, three waterspouts developed over Markermeer Lake, near Lelystad, on Friday. These waterspouts formed as a series of heavy showers passed over the region from the east, these showers later developing into a thunderstorm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tropical storm Fay formed off the North Carolina coast on July 9th and headed north, with the storm gaining structure and wind speed strength to become a strong tropical storm with sustained winds of around 60mph before it headed for a landfall in the northeast U.S. on July 10th. Tropical storm Fay made landfall just north of Atlantic City, New Jersey, and continued north through New York, with its sustained winds weakening as it passed through this area of particularly high insurance and reinsurance market exposure. KCC explained that parts of Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York all saw damaging winds from tropical storm Fay. Some power outages were reported in New York and New Jersey, although these were largely quickly resolved. The most likely impacts from tropical storm Fay are light wind damage, but some structural damage is possible from trees falling on buildings, KCC said. The catastrophe risk modeller highlighted that in New York City alone hundreds of downed trees were reported, while parts of New Jersey and Pennsylvania, among other areas, also experienced tree damage that resulted in infrastructure disruption. Low levels of storm surge were also seen along a swathe of the U.S. eastern seaboard from South Carolina to New York. Having run its catastrophe risk model, KCC believes that tropical storm Fay will result in an estimated close to $400 million of losses that fall to the insurance market. At that low-level losses to reinsurance capital would be expected to be minimal. KCC said its estimate includes privately insured wind and storm surge damage to residential, commercial and industrial properties, as well as automobiles.

NASA's Aqua satellite provided a look at the small record-breaker. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) reports that Gonzalo is the earliest seventh named storm on record in the Atlantic basin, beating Gert of 2005 by 2 days. Tropical Depression Seven formed on July 21 by 5 p.m. EDT in the Central North Atlantic Ocean, and by 8:50 a.m. EDT on July 22 it strengthened into a tropical storm and was renamed Gonzalo. One of the ways NASA researches tropical cyclones is using infrared data that provides temperature information. The AIRS instrument aboard NASA's Aqua satellite captured a look at those temperatures in Gonzalo and gave insight into the size of the storm and its rainfall potential. Cloud top temperatures provide information to forecasters about where the strongest storms are located within a tropical cyclone. Tropical cyclones do not always have uniform strength, and some sides have stronger sides than others. The stronger the storms, the higher they extend into the troposphere, and the colder the cloud temperatures. NASA provides that data to forecasters at NOAA's National Hurricane Center or NHC so they can incorporate it in their forecasting. On July 22 at 12:11 a.m. EDT (0411 UTC) NASA's Aqua satellite analyzed the storm using the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder or AIRS instrument. AIRS found coldest cloud top temperatures as cold as or colder than minus 63 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 53 degrees Celsius).

Forecast track of Typhoon ""Yolanda"" as of 2 a.m., 08 November 2013. Image from PAGASA
PAGASA said Yolanda is forecast to move west northwest at 39 kph. After hitting Guiuan, it is expected to traverse the provinces of Biliran, the northern tip of Cebu, Iloilo, Capiz, Aklan, Romblon, Semirara Island, southern part of Mindoro and then Busuanga.
Yolanda is expected to exit Philippine landmass on Saturday morning, moving towards the West Philippine Sea.
An estimated rainfall amount of 10 to 30 millimeters per hour (heavy - intense) is expected within the typhoon's 400-km diameter.
Sea travel is risky over the seaboards of Northern Luzon and the eastern seaboard of Central Luzon.
Residents in low lying and mountainous areas under signal nos. 4, 3 and 2 are alerted against possible flash floods and landslides. Likewise, those living in coastal areas under signal nos. 4, 3 and 2 are alerted against storm surges which may produce waves with height of at least 7 meters.
Storm surge warning
The Department of Science and Technology's Project NOAH (Nationwide Operational Assessment of Hazards) said areas in the path of the typhoon could experience tidal and storm-induced waves that could reach as high as 17 feet.
Project NOAH said Ormoc, Leyte could experience waves as high as 5.2 meters (17 feet), with its peak occurring at 2 p.m. today.
Other areas that will see seawater rise above more than 4 meters (13 feet) because of typhoon Yolanda include Matarinao Bay, Eastern Samar (4.7 meters); Port Pusgo, Quezon (4.6 meters); Santa Cruz Harbor, Quezon (4.3 meters); Poro Island, Biliran (4.3 meters); Banate, Iloilo (4.1 meters); and Port Barton, Palawan (4 meters).
An estimated 17 million people are forecast to be affected by cyclone-strength winds brought by the typhoon.
The Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System (GDACS), a cooperation framework between the United Nations, the European Commission and disaster managers worldwide to improve alerts, said 14.2 million people may be affected by Category 1 (120 kilometers per hour) wind speeds.
In an advisory issued at 5 a.m. on Friday (Manila time), GDACS said Yolanda was already packing 315 kph maximum sustained winds.
Massive evacuation
President Benigno Aquino had on Thursday warned his countrymen to make all possible preparations for Haiyan, which was packing monster wind gusts of nearly 380 kilometers (235 miles) an hour as it approached the Philippines.
""To our local officials, your constituents are facing a serious peril. Let us do all we can while (Haiyan) has not yet hit land,"" Aquino said in a nationally televised address.
""We can minimize the effects of this typhoon if we help each other. Let us remain calm, especially in buying our primary needs, and in moving to safer places.""
Aquino warned areas within the expected 600-kilometer typhoon front would be exposed to severe flooding as well as devastating winds, while coastal areas may see waves six meters (20 feet) high.
More than 125,000 people in the most vulnerable areas had been moved to evacuation centers before Haiyan hit, according to the civil defense office, and millions of others braced for the typhoon in their homes.
Authorities said schools in the storm's path were closed, ferry services suspended and fishermen ordered to secure their vessels.
In the capital of Manila, which was not directly in the typhoon's path but still expected to feel some of its impact, many schools were also closed.
Philippine Airlines, Cebu Pacific and other carriers announced the suspension of hundreds of flights, mostly domestic but also some international.
Cajulis said Haiyan was travelling quickly, at 39 kilometers an hour, and would travel across the country towards the South China Sea throughout Friday.
There were no immediate reports of casualties.
State weather forecaster Glaize Escullar said on Thursday Haiyan was expected to hit areas still recovering from a devastating storm in 2011 and from a 7.1-magnitude quake last month.
They include the central island of Bohol, the epicenter of the earthquake that killed 222 people, where at least 5,000 survivors are still living in tents while waiting for new homes.
Other vulnerable areas are the port cities of Cagayan de Oro and Iligan on the southern island of Mindanao, where flash floods induced by Tropical Storm Washi killed more than 1,000 people in December 2011.
Haiyan had maximum sustained winds on Friday morning of 315 kilometers an hour, and gusts of 379 kilometers an hour, according to the US Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Center.
The Philippine state weather service, which typically gives lower wind readings, said the maximum gusts on Friday morning were 275 kilometers an hour.
But even that reading would still make Haiyan the world's strongest typhoon this year, according to David Michael Padua, a meteorologist with the Weather Philippines Foundation, a storm monitoring organisation that runs the www.weather.com.ph website.
""The wind speeds of this extremely catastrophic cyclone has increased further to 315 km/hr, making it the most powerful typhoon ever observed since Super Typhoon Tip of 1979,"" Padua said.
The Philippines is battered by an average of 20 major storms or typhoons each year, many of them deadly, but scientists have said climate change may be increasing their ferocity and frequency.

Typhoon,haiyan,"At least 10,000 people are thought to have died in the central Philippine province of Leyte after_yphoon Haiyan, one of the strongest storms ever to make landfall, lashed the area, swallowing coastal towns, a senior police official said early on Sunday morning.
About 70-80% of the buildings in the area in the path of Haiyan in Leyte province was destroyed, said chief superintendent Elmer Soria. ""We had a meeting last night with the governor and the other officials. The governor said based on their estimate, 10,000 died,"" he said.
Tacloban city administrator Tecson Lim said that the death toll in that city alone ""could go up to 10,000"". Tacloban is the provincial capital of Leyte, with a population of more than 200,000. The Philippine Red Cross said in Tacloban bodies had been found ""piled up around the roads"" and in churches. Between 300 and 400 bodies had been recovered, Lim said.
On Samar island, which faces Tacloban, Leo Dacaynos of the provincial disaster office told Associated Press on Sunday 300 people were confirmed dead in Basey town and another 2,000 were missing.
He said the storm surge caused sea waters to rise 20 feet when the typhoon hit. There were still towns on Samar that had not been reached, he said, and appealed for food and water. Power was knocked out and there was no mobile signal, making communication possible only by radio.
Many corpses hung on tree branches, buildings and sidewalks, Associated Press reported.
""On the way to the airport we saw many bodies along the street,"" said Philippine-born Australian Mila Ward, 53, who was waiting at the Tacloban airport to catch a military flight back to Manila.
""They were covered with just anything tarpaulin, roofing sheets, cardboards,"" she said. Asked how many, she said, ""Well over 100 where we passed.""
The super-typhoon made landfall on Samar and Leyte islands in the eastern Visayas at about 4.40am on Friday local time, with winds up to 315km/h (195mph) tearing roofs off buildings, turning roads into rivers full of debris and knocking out electricity pylons.
With many provinces left without power or telecommunications, and airports in the hardest-hit areas, such as Tacloban, in tatters, experts say it is impossible to know the extent of the storm's damage _ or deliver badly needed aid.
Roughly 12 hours after the 600km (370-mile)-wide Haiyan blew west towards Vietnam, where it is expected to make landfall early on Sunday, officials and aid workers are only now beginning to piece together details on the number of dead and injured.
Government figures showed that more than 4 million had been directly affected. The World Food Programme has mobilised some $2m (£1.25m) in aid and aims to deliver 40 tonnes of fortified biscuits to victims within the next few days.
Satellite images show normally green patches of vegetation ripped up into brown squares of debris in Tacloban, where local TV channel GMA broadcast images of huge storm surges, flattened buildings and families traipsing through flooded streets with their possessions held high above the water.
The head of the UN Disaster Assessment Co-ordination Team, Sebastian Rhodes Stampa, described ""destruction on a massive scale"" in the city of 220,000 and said: ""The last time I saw something of this scale was in the aftermath of the Indian Ocean tsunami. There are cars thrown like tumbleweed and the streets are strewn with debris.""
Al-Jazeera correspondent Jamela Alindogan was trapped in her hotel as the eye of the storm passed overhead and ripped the roof off the building. Evoking scenes of chaos as badly hurt victims wandered the streets without medicine, food or water, and doctors at the local hospital attended to the wounded in the dark without electricity or candlelight, she said: ""There is no food, not even in the hotels, and there's no water. The situation is really very desperate.""
Other sources told of victims trying to climb out from under rubble to find assistance, and mobs rampaging through the streets looking for food, water or medicine, and looting electrical goods and groceries from malls. ""Almost all the houses were destroyed,"" said Major Rey Balido of the_hilippines_ational disaster agency. ""Only a few are left standing.""
Relatives of those living in the typhoon's path have had no news from their loved ones and are nervously waiting until power is restored to the area. ""I spoke to my mother just a few hours before the typhoon made landfall in my city, Tacloban,"" said taxi driver Sherwin Martinata, 32, in the capital, Manila. ""She was saying she was all right but now I have no idea if my family is safe. There is no power, no phones. I can't get through at all. I'm worried, but I'm powerless.""
Those living in the hardest-hit areas, such as the eastern Visayas, are among the poorest in the Philippines, say aid agencies, who warn that there will be little or no savings for many of the victims to fall back on _ putting an already vulnerable population at even greater risk of future food and job insecurity.
On Bohol island _ where a 7.3-magnitude earthquake toppled colonial-era churches and killed some 200 people last month _ residents were successfully evacuated ahead of the storm and as a result many lives were probably saved, said Mathias Eick of the European commission's humanitarian aid department (Echo). However, because the island's main power supply comes from neighbouring Leyte, residents are still without electricity or water.
In Tacloban, where many residents live along the coast, the sheer force of the storm was just too much for the buildings to withstand, with evacuation centres such as stadiums and churches later collapsing. ""The sheer magnitude and scale of the disaster sort of overpowered all the contingency measures, and we're fearing that we'll be finding more dead bodies in those evacuation centres themselves,"" said Alwynn Javier of Christian Aid.
Without information on the ground or access to hard-hit areas, aid agencies have been stuck, not knowing how much aid is needed or which areas need it most.
""The only information we have been able to get so far is from the UN and some from the news,"" said Javier. ""We should have good ground reach, but are really impeded by this lack of access because even our partners on the ground have been hit themselves.""
Officials and rescue workers hoped that Sunday would see concerted efforts by authorities to set up command centres and rescue groups, which will in turn help bring supplies to those who need them most. But gaining access to those areas will prove hard, said Richard Gordon of the Philippine Red Cross, who added that without bulldozers or tractors to clear paths, volunteers will have to bring cutting equipment to clear uprooted trees and debris.
The Philippines sees roughly 20 typhoons every year, with some more devastating than others. Last year's Typhoon Bopha killed more than 1,100 people and caused over $1bn in damage.
Haiyan _ the 25th typhoon to hit the Philippines this year _ is expected to make landfall in several provinces in central Vietnam with winds around 220km/h (137mph). More than 450,000 troops have been deployed, as well as 12 planes, 356 ships and thousands of vehicles, in order to mobilise supplies, with more than 300,000 people evacuated in Da Nang and Quang Ngai provinces.
""It may be the strongest storm to hit Vietnam in history,"" said Vietnam's director of the Central Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting Centre in Bui Minh Tang. Coastal areas should expect to see waves as high as 5-8 meters (16-26ft) and a wind radius up to 500km wide, officials warned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Experts say Typhoon Haiyan was about as strong as it could theoretically get when it swept through the Philippines, killing thousands of people and driving hundreds of thousands from their homes. But intensity limits have been rising over decades past — and climate models suggest they will keep rising over the decades to come, with the potential for bigger and more devastating storms.
""The tragedy of this particular storm is that it reached its limit just about the time it made landfall,"" Kerry Emanuel, a climate scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told NBC News.
Based on satellite imagery, the U.S. military's Joint Typhoon Warning Center estimated that Haiyan's winds reached a sustained peak as high as 195 mph shortly before it made landfall, with gusts rising to 235 mph. Estimates from Philippine weather officials were lower, suggesting that the storm packed sustained winds of 147 mph and gusts of 170 mph when it hit land. Either way, the typhoon ranks among the world's strongest tropical storms and appears to have been more powerful than Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
If the higher estimates are correct, the warning center said Haiyan's maximum strength would exceed that of its previous record-holder: Hurricane Camille, which hit the northern Gulf Coast in 1969 with sustained winds of 190 mph.
""This is at the top end of any tropical system that we've seen on our planet,"" said Bryan Norcross, The Weather Channel's hurricane specialist.
The definition of that top end has been shifting, Emanuel said. He was part of a team of researchers who predicted climate change could make tropical storms more intense, particularly in the Pacific.
""That part of the ocean, the Western Pacific, in November is pretty juicy,"" he said. ""It has a high thermodynamic limit. That limit has been going up in time, perhaps in response to global warming. It's a little hard to say that for sure."" 
Although the maximum intensity of tropical storms is projected to rise, the climate models suggest a scenario that's more complex than merely turning up the dials. ""It doesn't mean there'll be more storms,"" Emanuel said. ""In fact, the weaker storms might be less frequent, but it's not the weaker storms that do the damage. In the end, we're much more concerned about what happens at the high end. It's those guys that do all the terrible destruction.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Super Typhoon Haiyan smashed into the central island of Samar early on Friday morning, packing sustained winds of up to 315 kilometres per hour.
At least three people have been killed and seven injured, the government said.
Communications and power are down in several provinces, and authorities are still trying to make contact with some of the worst-hit areas.
There's particular concern about the city of Guiuan, with a population of 47,000, which was the first in line when Haiyan made landfall.
The typhoon has brought down power lines and trees, and destroyed crops, buildings and houses.
Amateur video has shown flooded streets caused both by heavy rain and a storm surge that was predicted to be as high as to seven metres.
Sea travel and flights have been suspended, and schools have been closed in the central region.
Rescue agencies say they are struggling to assess the full extent of the damage as the storm continues to batter the country.
The head of the Philippines Red Cross, Gwendolyn Pang, has told Asia Pacific even those who have sought emergency shelter are still at risk.
""Even people in evacuation centres - we are not quite sure if they're safe because the wind is very strong,"" she said.
""We have seen in the previous disasters - especially typhoons - still evacuation centres are not really safe for the people.
""We're trying our best to continue to monitor the situation...but it's so huge - so big.""
Ms Pang says the wind is making any aid efforts difficult.
""The challenge now is how are we going to continue to support the people in the next few hours or days because...our the wind is very strong and our activities are very limited at the moment,"" she said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The_ropical cyclone_roduced high_inds, coastal storm surges, heavy rains, and_looding_n the land areas over which it passed. By far the worst-hit region was the central Philippines, where the storm produced widespread devastation and killed thousands of people. Many considered it to be the country’s worst natural disaster. With maximum sustained winds at landfall there that measured 195 miles (314 km) per hour, Haiyan was among the most powerful tropical cyclones ever recorded, if not the most powerful, to strike land.
The typhoon began as an area of_onvection_ocated in the equatorial Pacific Ocean some 230 nautical miles (425 km) east-southeast of_ohnpei_n November 2. Later that day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) at_earl Harbor,_awaii, reclassified the disturbance as a tropical depression, naming the storm Tropical Depression 31W. The system traveled westward across the tropical Pacific Ocean over the next few days, growing in size and strength. The Japan Meteorological Agency reclassified the phenomenon as a_ropical storm_t midnight_reenwich Mean Time(GMT) on November 4 and assigned the name Haiyan, after its winds had reached a measured speed of 40 miles (64 km) per hour. With winds increasing to 75 miles (120 km) per hour sometime during the early afternoon on November 5, Haiyan had become a typhoon.
The storm continued to increase in intensity, and the JTWC upgraded Haiyan to a super typhoon (equivalent to a strong category 4 or category 5 hurricane, with maximum sustained one-minute surface winds of at least 150 miles [241 km] per hour) at 2:45_M_MT (10:45_M_ocal time) on November 6. At that moment Haiyan was located some 113 nautical miles (209 km) east-northeast of Palau and was moving westward at about 21 miles (about 34 km) per hour. Later in the day, the storm swelled to more than 500 miles (about 800 km) in diameter with a 9-mile- (14.5-km-) wide eye. Early in the morning of November 7, the storm’s eye wall passed over Palau’s Kayangel Islands with winds that, according to some reports, approached 155 miles (250 km) per hour. Haiyan’s winds continued to increase through the day, rising to 195 miles (314 km) per hour with gusts measured at 235 miles (378 km) per hour.
Haiyan made landfall in the Philippines at the city of Guiuan on the island of_amar_t 4:40_M_ocal time on November 8. The storm’s_tmospheric pressure_t that point was measured at 895 millibars (its lowest reading), and Haiyan had maximum sustained winds of 195 miles (314 km) per hour, the highest wind speed ever recorded at landfall.

Typhoon,,"Strong hurricanes could hit Asia and the U.S. East Coast more often this century, a new study finds.
The research adds to a growing body of evidence that hurricanes are becoming more intense as global warming heats the oceans. This means Category 1, 2 and 3 storms will have fiercer winds, bumping them up to Category 3, 4 and higher. Overall, the study's modeling approach predicts a 40 percent global increase in tropical cyclones of Category 3 and higher during the 21st century.
The findings were published in Monday's issue of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
The new study also projects that these strong storms will become more frequent in the North Pacific, the North Atlantic and the South Indian Oceans.
""We see an increase, in particular, toward the middle of the century,"" said Kerry Emanuel, study author and an MIT climatologist. ""The results surprised us, but we haven't gotten so far as to understand why this is happening.""
Scientists actively debate whether tropical cyclones (the broad name for hurricanes, typhoons and tropical storms) will become more frequent, more intense or both as a result of climate change. Global warming has heated the oceans along with the atmosphere, and sea-surface temperature is one of the most important influences on hurricane strength. But other factors — such as climate cycles, like the El Ni_o Southern Oscillation, and interactions with other storms, which can weaken or strengthen storms — also alter tropical storm strength. Hurricanes are also marvelous heat transporters, affecting climate by moving energy around the planet. [Hurricanes from Above: See Nature's Biggest Storms]
""For scientists, this is far from a solved problem,"" said Emanuel, who has been a main participant in the debates on the future of hurricanes. ""The main message is, we have to continue to regard there being a not-trivial risk of increasing problems from tropical cyclones because of climate change.""
How global warming fuels hurricanes
Hurricanes feed off warm ocean water. In the ocean's hurricane nurseries, heat rising from the ocean turns into water vapor. As the vapor rises and cools, it condenses into rain. This releases heat, which helps strengthen circulating tropical cyclones. Warmer oceans mean more water vapor, and more intense storms.
Emanuel relies on a technique called downscaling to estimate how future climate change will shift hurricane strength and frequency. In the new study, he used the latest global climate models, called CMIP5, which project future climate change but are too coarse to resolve ""small"" features, such as hurricanes. Emanuel ran the models at higher-resolution and randomly generated disturbances similar to tropical cyclones, and then used a theoretical model to predict how strong the storms would become. Emanuel first presented this approach, with an earlier version of the CMIP models (CMIP3), in a 2008 paper in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.
One limitation of relying on global climate models to predict future hurricanes is that these models do not capture the past decade's climate variability, such as relatively stable temperatures between 1998 and 2008, said Peter Webster, a climatologist at Georgia Tech who was not involved in the study. (The hiatus is attributed to natural variability in Earth's climate system, superimposed on the longer-term warming trend.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"“The United Nations agencies in the Philippines, with their humanitarian partners, are supporting the Government and other responders in their efforts to assess the situation and respond rapidly with vital supplies, through the coordination system led by the local authorities,” said Emergency Relief Coordinator Valerie Amos.
This morning, the UN Disaster Coordination Team (UNDAC) arrived in the city of Tacloban, one of the most affected areas, and reported scenes of total devastation, with all roads from the airport to the town blocked. The UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Food Programme (WFP) have also mobilized their in-country teams to reach those affected.
The Philippines Red Cross said it has received reports of 1,200 deaths in two areas hit by the typhoon, a drastic increase from the three reported yesterday.
“Sadly, it is likely that this figure will rise,” Ms. Amos said. ""The Government estimates that some 4.3 million people are affected, across 36 provinces, and initial assessments show that thousands of homes have been destroyed, roads are impassable and people need food, water, shelter and power.”
According to UNICEF, up to 1.7 million children could be affected by Haiyan. The agency has already mobilized its staff to deliver pre-positioned emergency supplies, and is flying in some 60 metric tonnes of additional supplies from Copenhagen, including medical and shelter equipment. They are expected to arrive within the next three days.
“UNICEF's first priorities are focused on life-saving interventions _ getting essential medicines, nutrition supplies, safe water and hygiene supplies to children and families,” said UNICEF's representative in the Philippines, Tomoo Hozumi.
In addition, the World Food Programme (WFP) has mobilized $2 million for the response, and will be appealing for more funds as the needs become clearer. As a preliminary measure, 40 metric tonnes of high-energy biscuits will be flown in from Dubai in the coming days. These are often provided in the early days of a crisis as they are light to transport and do not need cooking. WFP is also looking at other food commodities to stabilize the nutrition situation.
“The devastation we saw in Tacloban today was shocking,” said WFP Representative and Country Director Praveen Agrawal. “People have lost their homes and livelihoods, and the damage to infrastructure is substantial.""
In a statement issued by his spokesperson, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he was deeply saddened by the extensive loss of life and the serious damage to the infrastructure of the country.
“The Secretary-General offers his sincere condolences to the people and Government of the Philippines, particularly to those who have lost family members, their homes or have been otherwise affected by this disaster,” the statement said.
Haiyan, known locally as Yolanda, is one of the strongest storms ever recorded, hitting landfall with sustained winds of 295 kilometres per hour (kph), placing it above the 252 (kph) threshold for a Category 5 hurricane, the highest category on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. The typhoon is expected to hit Viet Nam later today.
Haiyan is the third major crisis to hit the Philippines in just two months. In October, the Bohol earthquake affected more than 3 million people, triggering landslides engulfing entire homes, ripping apart bridges and tearing down centuries-old churches. Seven cities in three different provinces were initially affected. In September, tens of thousands were forcibly displaced by armed clashes in Zamboanga City in the southern part of the country.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The national weather forecaster said Haiyan made landfall in northern province of Quang Ninh at5:00am local time_n Monday (22:00 GMT on Sunday)_s a tropical storm. It was moving towards southern China and is expected to weaken to a low depression later on Monday.
Downpours hit the capital, Hanoi, and houses in some northern provinces were damaged by strong winds.
“Several hundred houses had their roofs ripped off. Thousands of trees in the province were uprooted,” said Nguyen Cong Thuan, a disaster official in Quang Ninh province.
“Three people were reported missing,” he added.
National disaster officials said no deaths had been reported so far on Monday, although state media said five people had died during preparations for the typhoon.
Haiyan has weakened significantly since scything through the Philippines at the weekend, and had sustained winds of 120km per hour as it hit Vietnam. That was down from winds of over 300km per hour when the storm hit the Philippines, devastating Leyte and Samar provinces, as well as other areas.
More than 600,000 Vietnamese were evacuated from their homes at the weekend as Haiyan bore down on Vietnam.
The storm changed course on Sunday, prompting further mass evacuations of about 52,000 people in northern provinces by the coast.
“People must bring enough food and necessities for three days. Those who do not move voluntarily will be forced,” online newspaper_NExpress_aid, adding all boats have been ordered back to shore.

Typhoon,,"Just three weeks after a powerful earthquake shook the central area of the Philippines, the country has been hit by on of the most dangerous storms ever recorded. Typhoon Haiyan, known locally as Yolanda, made landfall on Friday with winds of around 300km/h and the diameter of up to 400 km, causing heavy rainfalls, flash floods and landslides. Despite preparedness measures taken by the national authorities devastation is vast, millions of people have been affected and the death toll is expected to be substantial. A team of ECHO humanitarian experts has been deployed on the ground and is conducting a rapid needs assessment with partner organisations. The European Commission stands ready to assist.
The Emergency Response and Coordination Centre (ERCC) of the European Commission's Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department ECHO is closely monitoring the situation. Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) reached the equivalent of a Hurricane Category 5 during its quick passage through the archipelago and is now heading towards Vietnam. Nearly 800 000 residents on the potentially affected areas were pre-emptively evacuated, including survivors of the island communities struck by the 7.2 magnitude earthquake on 15 October, who were staying in tent shelters, but humanitarian impact has nevertheless been high. Access to affected areas remains difficult, with power and telecommunications shutdowns in most of them as well.
The Philippines is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world, with 15 to 20 cyclones a year and major seismic upheavals, among other natural catastrophes. The European Commission has provided _42.7 million in disaster relief since 1997 and almost _8 million in preparedness. In 2013 alone, _2.5 million were made available for the response to the earthquake in Bohol, a total of _10 million were released to help rebuild the communities stricken in December 2012 by Typhoon Bopha (Pablo), and following flooding caused by Typhoon Trami (Maring) in August ECHO committed _200 000 to assist those affected.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"A senior U.N. humanitarian official said Monday that nearly 10 million people in the Philippines have been affected by the massive typhoon that ravaged the country on Friday.
John Ging, operations director of the U.N.’s humanitarian office, told reporters that 9.8 million people have been affected and 660,000 displaced from what he said was the biggest typhoon recorded in nearly a century.
Ging said the devastation wa huge and the U.N. was mobilizing for a massive response.
“We, in the United Nations and with our international NGO partners, are very much in support and we are focused on - as you would expect -- first and foremost, on the requirements for food, the requirements for shelter support, the requirements for medical support, to prevent the outbreak of public health disasters with so many people - estimated now over 10,000 people perished,” he said.
Ging expressed hope that the death toll would not go higher, but said everyone must be prepared for the worst as responders reach remote areas.
He commended the Philippine authorities, who he said were responding in a “very impressive” way.
Ging said efforts to reach those in need were complicated by logistical constraints, including damage to infrastructure, roads and airports.
U.N. Humanitarian chief Valerie Amos is on her way to the Philippines where she will launch an appeal for funds on Tuesday. In the meantime, the U.N. has released $25 million from its Central Emergency Relief Fund to assist aid agencies in quickly mobilizing relief efforts.

Our thoughts and prayers go out to the millions of people affected by this devastating storm.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"As the full devastation of Typhoon Haiyan became more evident Sunday, frustrations were running high among survivors desperate for relief aid three days after the disaster.
Typhoon Haiyan pummeled the Philippines’ eastern seaboard Friday. It flattened buildings and toppled trees, and authorities are still struggling to assess the full extent of damage left behind.
Survivors in some areas hardest-hit do not have access to food, water or an ability to communicate. Even the Philippine Red Cross and the ICRC offices in badly-hit Tacloban had been damaged, forcing staff to relocate temporarily.
“The devastation is ... I don't have the words for it,"" Interior Secretary Mar Roxas said. ""It's really horrific. It's a great human tragedy.""
The country had been bracing for rain and winds, but a massive storm surge of six metres caught the archipelago by surprise Friday, reaching up to a kilometre inland. Residents drowned and were washed away.
With winds that gusted to 275 kilometres per hour, officials say the typhoon was more powerful than 2007’s Hurrican Katrina, and twice as strong as Hurricane Sandy, which devastated parts of Northeastern United States last year.
The destruction is far-reaching:
	_	_stimates say at least 4 million people have been affected by the storm.
	_	_aiyan inflicted serious damage to at least six of the archipelago's more than 7,000 islands
	_	_he islands of Leyte, Samar and the northern part of Cebu appearing to bear the brunt of the storm.
	_	_NICEF estimated that 1.7 million children live in areas affected by the typhoon.
At least 300 people were confirmed dead and 2,000 missing on the eastern island of Samar, where some towns remain inaccessible to emergency crews. An official from the provincial disaster office in Samar said there was no power or cellphone signals.
The death toll in Tacloban, the capital city of Leyte Island, is estimated at 10,000. There, corpses were found laying in the streets, cars floating in water. Homes along the shoreline were severely damaged. In one area of the city, a large ship had been pushed ashore.
Tacloban Mayor Alfred Romualdez said the devastation has touched all residents. “I have not spoken to anyone who has not lost someone, a relative close to them,” he said.
Philippine-born Australian Mila Ward, 53, told The Associated Press that she passed “well over 100” bodies on the street on the way to Tacloban airport.
“They were covered with just anything _ tarpaulin, roofing sheets, cardboard,” she said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"_ giant typhoon, churning with winds of more than 230 mph, descended on the central Philippines this morning, killing at least four people and leaving thousands more homeless and without electricity.
The speed of the storm may have ultimately been the country's salvation, as Typhoon Haiyan quickly blew across the island nation rather than sitting over land to wreak havoc.
The typhoon_ade landfall at 4:40 a.m. local time near Guiuan, on the Philippine island of Samar, about 405 miles southeast of the country's capital, Manila.
At least four people have been killed, according to local media. Two people were electrocuted in storm-related accidents, one person was killed by a fallen tree, and another was struck by lightning.
More than 748,000 people have already been evacuated to the 644 evacuation centers across the country. Government officials said more than 3,000 are stranded in ports.
The U.S. Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Center said shortly before the typhoon made landfall that its maximum sustained winds were 195 mph, with gusts up to 235 mph.
The world's strongest recorded hurricane, typhoon or cyclone to previously make landfall was Hurricane Camille of 1969, which roared ashore with 190 mph winds in Mississippi. Haiyan's sustained winds easily make it a category 5 hurricane.
The Philippines government weather bureau said Haiyan had sustained winds of 147 miles per hour, with gusts of 170 mph when it made landfall.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Associated Press quotes officials in the Philippines saying at least 13 people are dead in the wake of a powerful typhoon that swept through the northern part of the country early Saturday morning.
Officials say Typhoon Nari slammed into the east coast around midnight Friday, toppling trees and electric pylons, and dumping heavy rain across the rice-growing central plains of Luzon. Local authorities say the storm cut electricity to more than 2 million people.
Thousands of people were evacuated from coastal villages before the typhoon struck.
Nari forced U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry to cancel a trip to Manilla scheduled for Friday and Saturday. Kerry told reporters Thursday the he will try to reschedule the trip in the coming weeks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,wipha,"At least 17 people have been killed in Japan by powerful typhoon Wipha, according to media reports.
The typhoon hit Izu Oshima, an island south of Japan’s capital city Tokyo, on Wednesday morning. It threw life out of gear by causing landslides and flooding in the island. More than 80 centimetres of rain fell in a span of 24 hours in the island.
Around 50 people have been reported missing.  Japan Meteorological Agency had earlier called the typhoon as once-in-a-decade-event.
The typhoon has been downgraded to a “tropical storm” and is heading north-east. Reports also say that Fukushima nuclear plant, which was badly hit when a tsunami and an earthquake struck simultaneously in March 2011, did not face much damage. Nuclear plant authorities were quoted saying, “the typhoon has caused no new damage to the plant”.
It has also been reported that many houses have been buried in mudslides, triggered by the rain, trapping people underneath. Rescue operations are on and flights and trains in Tokyo have been cancelled.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"An island south of Tokyo, Izu Oshima, was worst hit by Typhoon Wipha, suffering landslides and flooding.
Many people died when houses collapsed or were buried in mudslides. At least 50 people remain unaccounted for.
Work to protect the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant was carried out but the operators say it appears to have escaped the worst of the storm.
In Tokyo, flights were cancelled, bullet train services suspended and schools closed.
""It is the strongest typhoon in 10 years to pass the Kanto [Tokyo area] region,"" Hiroyuki Uchida, the Japan Meteorological Agency's chief forecaster, told journalists on Tuesday.
Typhoon Wipha has now been downgraded to a tropical storm as it moves north-east.
The storm brought strong winds and record rainfall on Wednesday morning.
Nearly 5 inches (12cm) of rainfall fell in just one hour on Izu Oshima island, some 120km (75 miles) south of Tokyo.
The storm sent large volumes of earth down mountainsides and caused rivers to burst their banks.
Television footage showed the remains of wooden homes buried in mud and covered in debris.
""I heard a crackling sound and then the trees on the hillside all fell over,"" a woman on the island told national broadcaster NHK television. ""Then mud slid as far as the house.""
Japanese media said the death toll had risen to 16 but 51 people remained unaccounted for on Izu Oshima.
Rescuers were struggling to access many areas, local reports said.
""City hall and fire officials are doing rescue work in places that are accessible,"" a local official told AFP news agency.
Extra police officers and soldiers as well as helicopters have been sent to the island - a popular tourist destination with more than 8,000 residents - to help with the rescue effort.
In Tokyo, a woman died after falling in a river and a search was under way for two young boys last seen on a beach, reports said.
About 400 domestic and international flights were also cancelled in the capital, Kyodo news agency said.
Nearly 20,000 people were ordered to leave and thousands of schools shut as a result of the typhoon, Reuters news agency reported.
Around midday (03:00 GMT), the typhoon passed close to Fukushima, where contaminated water used to cool reactor cores is being stored in temporary tanks.
Plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Company said it had to pump out rain water from around the storage tanks, but added that its radiation readings were within a safe limit.
The storm had caused the plant no new problems, a spokesman said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Typhoon Wipha, which is currently a storm with 110 mph winds located several hundred miles south of Kyoto, Japan, appears poised to sideswipe, or possibly even make a direct hit on Japan in the coming days. The storm is expected to bring strong winds, heavy rain, and high waves to the Japanese coast from Tokyo northward, including the ailing Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, where cleanup efforts have already hit serious roadblocks.
Current forecasts show Wipha making landfall, or coming close to making landfall, near Tokyo on Tuesday into Wednesday, while transitioning from a weakening tropical cyclone into a hybrid storm, with characteristics of both a tropical storm and an extratropical system. Those characteristics are similar to some of the features that Hurricane Sandy had when it devastated the U.S. East Coast nearly a year ago this month. Wipha could bring an expanded area of high winds and pounding surf along with several inches of rain to heavily populated areas of Japan, including the vulnerable nuclear plant that was incapacitated by the massive earthquake and tsunami in 2011. The tsunami led to a series of cascading engineering failures, culminating in a triple nuclear meltdown at the plant in the worst accident at a nuclear power plant since Chernobyl in 1986.
Ryan Maue, a meteorologist at WeatherBell Analytics, a private forecasting firm, told Climate Central that the storm poses a “huge flood potential” for the Fukushima area. “Deep convection on the westward flank of the storm . . . plus the topography of Japan means heavy rain for the coastline regardless of the Typhoon's track,” he said in an email message. “Wipha is extra-large size-wise,” Maue said, predicting it will grow and strengthen as it makes its closest pass to Japan, aided by strong jet stream winds in the upper atmosphere.
Even in the absence of landfalling typhoons, cleanup work at Fukushima has hit numerous serious roadblocks, with recent discoveries that the plant has been leaking radioactive water into the Pacific Ocean. A team of 16 experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency is currently in Japan to visit the plant and advise the Japanese government on how to deal with the challenge of storing large amounts of radioactive material on site.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Here’s an astonishing statistic: Typhoon Wipha dumped 33 inches (850 mm) of rain in 24 hours on Oshima Island, 75 miles south of Tokyo.
It is the greatest rainstorm to occur on Oshima, populated by 8,200 people, since records began in 1991 reports the AP. It also twice the entire average rainfall for the month of October, notes the Wall Street Journal.
Incredibly, 17 inches (426 mm) fell in 4 hours and nearly 5 inches in one hour.
Those are unfathomable rainfall rates and, thus, it is no surprise they led to destructive mudslides and fatalities.
At least 17 people are dead from the typhoon and 45 to 50 missing according to wire reports. 16 of the 17 casualties occurred on Oshima.
283 homes were damaged or destroyed on Oshima, the AP says.
“The storm sent large volumes of earth down mountainsides and caused rivers to burst their banks,” reports the BBC. “Television footage showed the remains of wooden homes buried in mud and covered in debris.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"At least 13 people were killed and over 50 missing, with nearly 20,000 people ordered to evacuate and hundreds of flights cancelled as Typhoon Wipha pummelled Japan’s Pacific coast on Wednesday, leaving piles of wreckage on one small island but largely sparing the capital Tokyo.
Operators of the wrecked Fukushima nuclear power plant north of Tokyo pumped rainwater out of protective containers at the base of some 1,000 tanks storing radioactive water, and were taking other precautions, as the typhoon brushed past Tokyo and moved up the coastline.
Television footage showed roads clogged with heaps of wreckage and houses with gaping holes.
“I heard a crackling sound and then the trees on the hillside all fell over,” a woman on Oshima island told NHK national television. “Then mud slid as far as the house.”
The storm brought hurricane-force winds and drenching rain to the metropolis of 30 million people at the peak of the morning rush hour, halting some train services. Other trains operated at partial capacity.
The storm, which was picking up speed as it moved north, was 170 km (105 miles) south of the city of Miyako and moving north northeast at 75 kph (47 mph) at 11am (0200 GMT), according to the Japan Meteorological Agency’s website.
It carried sustained winds at its centre of 126 kph (78 mph) and gusts up to 180 kph (112 mph) and was expected to weaken into a tropical depression later on Wednesday.
Over 500 flights at Tokyo’s Haneda and Narita airports were cancelled, and several subway lines in the city stopped running due to the high winds. Thousands of schools closed as a precaution.
The typhoon passed close to the crippled Fukushima plant, 220 km (130 miles) north of Tokyo, shortly before noon.
The operator of the plant, Tokyo Electric Power Corp , which has been struggling to contain radioactive leaks, said it would cancel all offshore work and would decide whether to continue work onshore after assessing the weather.
It was pumping out rainwater at the tanks storing radioactive water, a by-product of a jerry-rigged cooling system designed to control reactors wrecked in a 2011 earthquake and tsunami.
The rainwater will be pumped into an empty tank, checked for radioactivity and, if uncontaminated, released into the sea, the company said.
Nissan Motor Co cancelled the Wednesday morning shift at its Oppama and Yokohama plants south of Tokyo and said it was waiting to decide what to do about later shifts. Oppama makes the all-electric Leaf and other models.
Typhoon Wipha is the strongest storm to approach eastern Japan since October 2004. The cyclone that year triggered floods and landslides that killed almost 100 people, forced thousands from their homes and caused billions of dollars in damage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Often the first reinsurance-linked investment manager to come out with an official statement after a catastrophe event, Swiss ILS investment manager Plenum Investments has said that it does not expect any impact to its catastrophe bond fund from Japanese Typhoon Wipha.
Typhoon Wipha struck Japan just over 24 hours ago, brushing the main island of Honshu and passing by Tokyo only around 30 miles offshore. Wipha brought typhoon force winds and tropical rainstorms to much of Japan, the storm itself was almost as large as the entire country and the Japanese meteorological association called it the largest and most powerful typhoon to strike Japan in a decade.
Japanese typhoon risks are a peril which is part of the catastrophe bond market, with a few outstanding cat bonds having exposure to the peril and thus to typhoon Wipha.
Plenum Investments said that as typhoon Wipha passed Japan it merged with a cold front and transitioned into an extratropical storm, much like Sandy did in the U.S. Wipha was much weaker though and also passed by Tokyo near to low tide which meant that storm surge damage will have been minimal.
Typhoon Wipha badly impacted some islands in the Izu cluster to the south of Tokyo, causing extensive damage and some loss of life, but damage to Tokyo and other metro areas of Japan is not expected to have been severe. Plenum notes that Japanese building codes and construction standards are designed to withstand storms of this severity meaning that only minor damages are to be expected.
Plenum Investments cat bond fund has only a limited exposure to Japan typhoon risk, of around 1.5% of the funds NAV. Due to the nature of the storm and the minimal exposure, Plenum Investments does not expect typhoon Wipha to have an adverse effect on its Japan typhoon cat bond investments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Tokyo: Hundreds fled their homes on Sunday on a Japanese island already devastated by a typhoon for fear that torrential rain would trigger fresh mudslides.
The town of Oshima, 120 kilometres south of Tokyo, advised 2,300 residents in two districts on the island of the same name to evacuate, saying rain was expected to intensify due to a depression.
A total of 632 people had taken shelter in school gyms and community halls by early afternoon, an official at the town’s administrative office said.
Many others were staying at relatives’ homes in safer areas of the island, she said.
The meteorological agency has warned that rainfall could reach 40 millimetres per hour in the afternoon and has urged residents to be on alert.
The rain could trigger fresh landslides on the island where at least 27 residents were killed as a typhoon struck last week. Two others died in or near Tokyo.
Twenty-one people were still missing but search operations were suspended due to the bad weather.
Military airplanes flew 14 inpatients at the island’s medical centre to hospitals in central Tokyo while Prime Minister Shinzo Abe cancelled his visit to the island set for Sunday.
Powerful typhoon Wipha triggered mudslides that buried some 30 houses and damaged more than 300 structures on Oshima last week.
Empress Michiko cancelled events scheduled Sunday at the imperial palace in Tokyo to celebrate her 79th birthday in the wake of the disaster.

Typhoon,,"Typhoon Wipha, currently located in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, is pushing to the northeast towards Japan over the next 24 hours. It will likely bring heavy rain, gusty winds, and large surf across the east coast of Japan today (October 15, 2013). Fortunately, Wipha is projected to weaken as it moves over cold waters and into an atmosphere that is unfavorable for strengthening as wind shear increases. Still, Typhoon Wipha is likely to add more problems to those trying to fix Japan’s damaged Fukushima nuclear plant, where there have been leaks of radioactive water into the ocean and several workers last week were accidentally doused with radioactive water.
As of October 15 at 9Z (or 5 a.m. EST), the Joint Typhoon Warning Center reports that Typhoon Wipha contains 80-knot winds, which is estimated around 90 miles per hour (mph) or 148 kilometers per hour (kph). The storm is accelerating to the northeast at 17 knots.
At one point, Wipha was a strong Category 4 typhoon with sustained winds around 130 mph this past Sunday. Now, Wipha is transitioning from a tropical system into an extratropical system. What does that mean? It means that its winds will likely expand outward and create a larger impact across Japan today. Rainfall totals of 3-7 inches are possible.
The extra rain and large surf is a major concern for the Fukushima plant trying to recover since the tragic earthquake and tsunami devastated the area back in 2011. Wipha will only complicate matters and result in delays in trying to fix radioactive leaks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,utor,"Last night (August 10, 2013), Typhoon Utor intensified into a Super Typhoon with winds estimated around 130 knots, or roughly 150 miles per hour. It is pushing to the northwest into the Philippines today, and made landfall around 3 a.m. according to local clocks there on Monday, August 12, 2013. Heavy rain, flash flooding, storm surge over 20 to 30 feet, and damaging winds are likely for the Philippines as the storm bears down on the northern island of Luzon.
Super Typhoon Utor, also known as Typhoon Labuyo in the Philippines, has been going through an eye wall replacement cycle. These cycles typically occur when storms become intense. The eye wall is where the strongest winds are located in the system, and when it becomes so strong, the eye wall typically collapses and reorganizes into another eye wall. During this transition phase, the cyclone becomes slightly weaker. The latest imagery from the storm does not indicate a visible eye, which could be good news for the the island of Luzon. However, the impacts are still expected to cause major problems.
Once Super Typhoon Utor pushes through the Philippines, it is expected to weaken into Category 1 or 2 storm. It will continue to push to the northwest and later impact parts of southeast China, and possibly skirting just to the south and west of Hong Kong. Forecasting the intensity of a tropical cyclone can be difficult, meaning everyone across the region should pay close attention to this typhoon over the next several days. However, it looks like there is potential for the storm to intensify after it pushes over the Philippines and emerges back over warm waters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Earth’s strongest storm of 2013 so far, typhoon Utor, did a number on the northern Philippines.  Now it’s destined for southeastern China.
Utor, referred to as Labuyo in the Philippines, packed maximum sustained winds of 140 mph as it battered the northern island of Luzon.
The storm killed at least two people and destroyed 80 percent of the infrastructure in town of Casiguran near where it came inland according to reports.
In the hours prior to landfall, Utor’s intensity peaked at 150 mph, the equivalent of high-end category 4 hurricane and earning it “super typhoon” status (winds must be 150 mph for “super typhoon” classification), briefly.  That intensity bested any storm globally in 2013 writes Jeff Masters at wunderground.
“Earth’s previous most powerful tropical cyclone of 2013 was Typhoon Soulik, which reached Category 4 strength with 145 mph winds on July 10,” Masters says.
As it passed over Luzon, Utor dumped over 7.5 inches of rain in the cities of Dagupan and and Baguio notes AccuWeather.
The storm weakened markedly as it crossed over Luzon’s mountainous terrain, but is likely to regain some strength as it passes over the South China Sea.  As of 11 a.m., the Joint Typhoon Warning Center says its maximum sustained winds are around 100 mph and it forecasts gradual strengthening over the next two days:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"A satellite map shows Typhoon Utor, which is referred to as Labuyo in the Philippines, at 2:32 p.m. local time Monday.
The world's strongest storm of the year so far plowed across the northern Philippines on Monday, killing at least one person and leaving 20 fishermen missing.
Packing winds as strong as 200 kilometers per hour (124 mph), Typhoon Utor made landfall early Monday on the east coast of the Philippine island of Luzon, damaging hundreds of houses.
""It's the strongest typhoon we've had so far on the planet this year,"" said CNN International meteorologist Samantha Mohr. ""So that gives you some idea of the magnitude of this system.""
Utor, known in the Philippines as Labuyo, churned west-northwest over Luzon, dumping heavy rain on the island's hilly terrain and bringing the risk of landslides. It weakened as it moved over land, and by Monday afternoon, it had begun to head out into the South China Sea.
Aid groups in the Philippines, which had been preparing for the storm's arrival for several days, said they were only just beginning to assess the situation on the ground in the hardest-hit areas.
""There's a high risk that part of the population may get isolated because of landslides and difficulty moving around,"" said Anna Lindenfors, country director for Save the Children in the Philippines.
The country's National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council reported one death in the province of Benguet on Monday afternoon.
Twenty fishermen who had headed out to sea before the storm's arrival remained unaccounted for, the agency said. But dozens of others who had initially been reported missing had returned home safely, it said.
The agency reported damage to 673 houses in the province of Aurora, where the storm made landfall.
The typhoon destroyed nearly 80% of the infrastructure in Casiguran, a town that lay in Utor's path across the province, CNN affiliate ABS-CBN reported.
The storm tore apart rickety houses and ripped the roof off a local hospital, the local broadcaster said, showing images of flattened homes buried under fallen trees.
Situated near an area of the Pacific Ocean where typhoons form, the Philippines regularly suffers severe storm damage.
An average of 20 typhoons hit the Southeast Asian country every year, and two or three of those cause serious damage, according to Plan International, an aid and development organization.
Utor is expected to pick up more strength over the warm waters of the South China Sea over the next day or so before making landfall on the southern coast of China on Wednesday.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"CloudSat overpassed Typhoon Utor in the West Pacific on August 11, 2013 at 0518 UTC, this storm contained estimated maximum strength winds of 115 knots (132 mph) and minimum pressure of 937mb.
The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA's Aqua satellite captured the infrared (IR) image taken a few minutes before the CloudSat overpass (the blue line A-> B on Figures 1, 2 and 3). CloudSat overpassed about 10km to the east of the center of the storm revealing the structure of the eye and eye wall. This is one a handful of cases where CloudSat has directly intersected the eye of a storm of this intensity and size. The strength of Utor's at this time is equivalent to category 4 strength hurricane.
This overpass reveals many unique features of a well defined and intense Typhoon (tropical cyclone) - outward sloping eye and eyewall, rainband areas, moats and areas of high reflectivity (greater than 30dBZ). Heavy precipitation is distinuguished by the attenuation of the radar (lack of signal) in the lowest 5 km's (up to almost 10 km's in the eyewall area) of the CloudSat swath. The CloudSat overpasses reveals large amounts of liquid and ice water spread throughout the storm and also distinguishes rainbands areas separated by moats (cloud free areas) beneath the cirrus canopy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Footage from ABS-CBN TV network showed a woman being swept away by a raging river in neighbouring Isabela province. The woman waved her hands for help as she struggled to hang on to debris while being buffeted by huge waves in the muddy waters. It was not immediately clear what happened to her.
""We have no official report yet, and we do not know if up to this time she has not been rescued,"" said Norma Talosig, a regional civil defence director. She said the woman lived alone in a low-lying area in San Agustin town and had refused to be evacuated.
In mountainous Benguet province, a 22-year-old man died on the way to hospital after he was pulled from a landslide that hit the roadside canal he was clearing, said regional civil defence official Andrew Alex Uy.
The typhoon triggered waves of up to 2.5 metres (8ft) and left scores of fishermen missing.
In northern Pangasinan province, 25 fishermen on board three boats failed to return home, said a provincial police spokesman, Senior Inspector Ryan Manongdo.
Twenty people from the eastern provinces of Catanduanes and Camarines Norte were also unaccounted for. Authorities were hoping they had taken shelter in coves and on nearby islands, said Bernardo Alejandro IV, the regional director for the office of civil defence.
""I hope they're just waiting for the typhoon to pass and will show up as soon as the weather clears,"" he said.
As of Monday afternoon, the typhoon had crossed the Philippines' main northern island of Luzon and was off the country's north-west coast with winds of 87mph and gusts of 106 mph, government weather forecaster Jun Galang said.
He said the typhoon may intensify over the South China Sea as it moves toward China. He said the storm carried a lot of rain but was moving fast, so the rainfall was not concentrated in one area. Utor was forecast to make landfall in Guandong, China, on Wednesday.
About 1,000 residents in the Bicol region of the central Philippines spent the night in shelters, while Aurora province was without power, the national disaster agency said. Radio stations reported roofs being blown off and a covered basketball court was washed away in Dinalungan town.
About 1,100 travellers remained stranded as passenger and cargo ferries were grounded. School classes in towns and cities on the typhoon's path were suspended, including in Manila, the capital. Several domestic flights were cancelled.

Heavy rain and winds of up to 122 km per hour (76 mph) were recorded in parts of Hong Kong, with a number of flights canceled at the city's international airport.
While financial markets, schools, businesses and non-essential government services close when any No. 8 or above signal is hoisted, the cyclone was not expected to hit Hong Kong directly, but to stray towards the western fringes of China's Guangdong province, nearer to Macau and the island of Hainan.
Should the No. 8 signal remain hoisted until 9 a.m. on Wednesday (0100 GMT), the Hong Kong stock exchange will remain closed for at least part of the day.
As of late Tuesday, more than 3,000 passengers were stranded at Sanya and Haikou airports on Hainan, according to China's official Xinhua news agency.
Some train and shipping services were also suspended, with waves of over 10 meters (32 feet) expected in some coastal zones.
Utor was the worst typhoon to hit the Philippines this year, displacing over 30,000 families as it caused landslides and floods and disrupted power and communications links.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Four people were killed while 67 — including 53 fishermen and nine mountaineers — remained missing as Typhoon Utor left for the South China Sea after a deadly 24-hour landfall in Luzon on Monday.
Reynaldo de la Cruz, 53, drowned in Nueva Vizcaya, northern Luzon on Tuesday, a day after Typhoon Utor entered Aurora Province causing floods, landslides and toppling trees and power lines, said Undersecretary Eduardo del Rosario, head of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC).
Del Rosario added that Joemar Salicong, 22, died in a landslide in Tuba, Benguet, also in northern Luzon on Monday.
Earlier on Saturday Dolores Montero, 68 and her granddaughter Erica Montero Sim, 8, drowned when their motorboat was destroyed off Buenavista coastal village in Cagnion, Surigao, central Philippines, another affected area, said del Rosario.
He said the two victims were identified by NDRRMC’s provincial office.
Meanwhile, a ground report from northern Luzon said that Benny Labio, 40, died when his house was swallowed by the Cagayan River in Maand village, San Agustin town, meaning the number of fatalities could reach five.
“We hope this is the final list of casualties,” del Rosario said, adding the number could change dramatically in the storm’s aftermath.
Some 35 fishermen from the western Pangasinan towns of Infanta and Bolinao were reported missing after they failed to return home from sailing on August 5 and 8, said del Rosario, adding that five of the fishermen were not yet identified.
Some 23 fishermen from Camarines Norte and Catanduanes in Bicol, southern Luzon, remained missing after they set sail last week, before Typhoon Utor was seen in the Pacific Ocean, said del Rosario, adding they were part of a group of 75 fishermen who sailed to the sea, 52 of whom managed to return safely on Sunday.
Meanwhile, nine mountaineers were reported missing after they failed to return from Mount Tarak in Alas-asin village, in Bataan on Saturday, Bataan Governor Albert Garcia said, adding that Typhoon Utor might be responsible for their disappearance. Their names were not released.
Some 30 kilometres of road was flooded in Dilasalag, Aurora, the hardest hit province in northeastern Luzon, where three towns, Casiguran, Dilasag, and Dinalungan were declared in a state of calamity, said del Rosario.
Ninety per cent of crops were damaged in Dilasalag due to floods, confirmed Mayor Victorio Briones.
Almost all roads were impassable due to floods and landslides in many towns of Aurora, said Aurora Governor Gerardo Noveras, adding that power came back 24 hours after rains and winds toppled electric poles in these towns.
Seventy three houses were damaged while five were destroyed in Aurora, said Noveras, adding the typhoon’s wrath is still being assessed in Aurora’s tow other towns such as Dingalan and Dipaculao.
People stranded on riverbanks were evacuated in coastal towns of Nueva Vizcaya, another hard hit area in northern Luzon, TV footage showed.
In other submerged areas, rising rivers swept animals, crops, and houses, the same report said.
Floods isolated several towns in Isabela province although it was not directly hit by the typhoon, said Isabela Gov. Faustino Dy III.
People rejoiced when nine passengers and a driver emerged alive from a vehicle that was buried by a landslide in Itogon town, northern Luzon on Tuesday morning, said Chief Inspector Fernando Botangen of the Itogon police.
A four-metre high flood occurred in Baguio City’s Camp Lagoon. The northern Luzon summer capital also suffered power outage, telecommunications failure, and road closures due to rockfalls.
The typhoon dumped most of its 24-hour rain in northern Luzon’s Baguio City; central Luzon’s Dagupan and Cabanatuan cities and Iba town, Zambales, said the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa), a government run weather station.
Typhoon Utor left the Philippines early on Tuesday morning, Pagasa confirmed.
A total of 20 storms enter the Philippines every year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Typhoon Utor powered ashore on the northern Philippine Island of Luzon on Monday near 3 am local time (3 pm EDT Sunday) as a Category 4 storm with 140 mph winds. Damage was heavy in Casiguran (population 24,000) near where the typhoon made landfall, with 80% of the infrastructure of the town reportedly destroyed, and all roads into the city blocked. Utor is being blamed for two deaths so far, and 44 fishermen are reported as missing.
Passage over Luzon disrupted the inner core of Utor, reducing the storm to Category 2 strength with winds of 100 mph. Satellite imagery shows that the typhoon is re-organizing, and a new eyewall is forming. Ocean temperatures are very warm, about 30°C (86°F), which is approximately 0.5 - 1.0°C above average. These warm waters extend to tremendous depth, giving Utor a huge source of energy to tap into. Wind shear is low, 5 - 10 knots. These favorable conditions for intensification will last until the typhoon gets midway between the Philippines and China, where wind shear will rise to the moderate range and ocean waters will cool to 29°C with a much lower heat content. I expect Utor will intensify into a Category 3 storm today, and make landfall in China as a Category 2 or 3 storm about 200 hundred miles southwest of Hong Kong about 06 UTC on Wednesday. Utor is a very wet storm, and will likely bring a large swath of 8+ inches of rain across Southeast China on Wednesday. These rains will cause dangerous flash flooding and mudslides.
Utor is a Marshallese word for squall line, and has been used for three tropical cyclones in the Western Pacific--in 2001, 2006, and 2013. Utor reached super typhoon status with 150 mph winds on Sunday, making it the strongest tropical cyclone globally so far in 2013. Earth's previous most powerful tropical cyclone of 2013 was Typhoon Soulik, which reached Category 4 strength with 145 mph winds on July 10. Soulik weakened to a Category 2 storm before hitting Taiwan on July 12.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Twenty-three people were missing as Typhoon Utor swept across the northern Philippines on Monday, ripping roofs off houses, tearing down power lines and triggering landslides in remote villages.
With wind gusts of 200 kilometres (124 miles) an hour, Utor was the most powerful storm to strike the Philippines this year and authorities were on alert for worst-case scenarios.
""This has the strongest sustained winds for the year,"" government weather forecaster Samuel Duran told AFP.
Hundreds of people die each year in the Philippines from the roughly 20 typhoons that strike the country annually.
There were no immediate reports of casualties from Utor on Monday morning, but the national disaster agency said it was concerned for 23 missing fishermen.
""They went out to sea before we declared that a storm was approaching,"" said National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council spokesman Reynaldo Balido.
""We are still hoping that within the day, they will return home. The practice in those areas is if a storm is approaching, they seek refuge somewhere.""
There were also concerns for remote towns and villages that had been isolated by the storm, with telecommunications networks to the areas out of order and roads cut off by landslides.
After building strength in the Pacific Ocean, Utor hit the northern regions of the main island of Luzon at 3:00 am on Monday (1900 GMT on Sunday).
Television footage from Aurora province, along the east coast of Luzon where Utor made landfall, showed uprooted trees that had fallen on top of houses, while roofs were ripped off some buildings.
The civil defence director for Aurora province, Josefina Timoteo, said reports had been received of more than 600 houses and 12 school buildings being damaged in one town, Dinalungan.
Alex Uy, the civil defence chief in charge of the northern mountain city of Baguio, said power outages were widespread across northern Luzon.
""The wind speed is strong enough to topple power lines. Even in our office, we have no electricity. We have to use a generator,"" Uy told AFP.
As of midday (0400 GMT), the storm was about half way across Luzon, passing over some of the most mountainous and isolated terrain in the country, moving westward towards the South China Sea.
It was expected to move out of the Philippines by late Monday, according to the weather bureau.
In Manila, the nation's capital, roughly 200 kilometres to the south of the storm, there was heavy rain overnight but no major flooding.
With more rain expected, many schools across the capital were closed on Monday.
Over a thousand people were killed when Typhoon Bopha hit the Philippines in December, the most devastating storm in the world for 2012.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Typhoon Utor, the strongest weather disturbance to enter the Philippines this year, battered the northern provinces in the main island of Luzon early Monday, stranding more than 8,000 passengers, forcing several flights and ferries to be canceled, knocking power out in a couple of provinces and leaving 23 fishermen missing, disaster officials said.
Classes in the Philippine capital of Manila and its neighboring provinces were suspended in anticipation of bad weather, but rains weren't as heavy and winds weren't as strong as they were in the provinces of Aurora, Nueva Viscaya and Isbela.
Typhoon Utor gathered speed as it made landfall on Aurora province, traveling at 22 kilometers per hour, at dawn Monday. Its sustained winds slowed to 140 kilometers per hour from 160 kph, while gustiness weakened to 170 kph from 200 kph. The typhoon's rain band also shrunk to 500 kilometers from 600 kilometers.
Typhoon Utor is expected to be over the South China Sea and outside from the Philippines' area of responsibility by early Tuesday, weather forecast Jori Loiz told a televised briefing Monday.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Heavy rain and howling winds are lashing the northern Philippines and Taiwan as Typhoon Usagi goes through the Luzon Strait which divides them.
Villages have been evacuated, ferries suspended and flights cancelled.
Meteorologists say the storm is the most powerful this year and will bring a cumulative rainfall of 1,000mm (39in) as it heads towards China.
The authorities there have announced a red alert ahead of the expected arrival of the storm on Monday.
The US Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Centre said on Friday that Usagi was packing sustained winds of 240 km/h (150 mph), with gusts of up to 296 km/h (185mph), making it the equivalent of a strong category four Atlantic hurricane.
Taiwan is reported to have deployed more than 1,600 soldiers in ""high risk"" areas prone to flooding and landslides while placing 24,000 others on standby.
Authorities in the Philippines are reported to have evacuated nearly 250 people in the northern agricultural province of Tarlac, while ferries are restricted to their ports.
There are particular concerns about the impact of the storm on the Batanes islands in the north of the Philippines, with warnings that large trees could be uprooted, plantations flattened and power and communications severely disrupted by flash flooding, landslides and storm surges.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Chinese state media report that the death toll in the northeast of the country has risen to 37 since floods began on August 10.
Liaoning province reported 12 flood-related deaths after downpours on Friday and Saturday, 14 were killed in Jilin province, and officials in Heilongjiang province said 11 had died, according to the official Xinhua news agency.
Xinhua reported that the flooding in the area was the worst in several decades, displacing some 140,000 people and destroying more than 2,500 houses. Railways and highways were cut off and bridges damaged.
Losses have been put at 7.13 billion yuan ($1.17 billion, 874 million euros).
Meanwhile, Southern China is recovering after being battered by Typhoon Utor last week. Xinhua said 10 people were dead and four others missing in the southern province of Guangdong and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
Flood of the century
Across the border in Russia, flooding has also caused widespread devastation in the country's far east, though no casualties have been reported so far.
The floods have been declared a natural disaster in the worst-affected regions of Amur and Khabarovsk. Authorities say the floods are the worst in more than a century.
Tens of thousands of emergency services workers and civilians have been struggling to contain the waters of the Amur River on Russia's border with China. The minister of Regional development, Viktor Ishayev, said more than 17,000 people had been evacuated and that this figure could rise to as many as 100,000.
""The damage is extensive, but the most significant achievement is there have been no casualties ... we cannot relax, there is still a lot of work to be done,"" Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a televised address on Saturday.
The Interfax news agency reported that Prime Minister Dimitry Medvedev had earmarked 3.2 billion rubles (73 million euros, $97 million) for the affected regions, though the bill for damage is expected to be much higher.
The flooding occurred after massive rains since the end of July caused the Amur River, and one of its tributaries, the Zeya, to burst their banks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,danas,"While tropical systems in the Atlantic Basin have been sputtering, leaving many breathing a sigh of relief, a typhoon in the Western Pacific had thousands of Americans on edge.
Danas, at one time a typhoon packing winds of 145 miles per hour, made a beeline toward the Japanese island of Okinawa. Okinawa is the home to Kadena Air Force base, which houses more than 18,000 American military personnel and their families. Luckily, Danas didn't make a direct hit on the island or the base and no immediate reports of damage were available.  
In an email to The Weather Channel the public affairs office on Kadena Air Force base says they used a graduated system of warnings, ranging from TC-4 to TC-1.  TC-4 is a general state of readiness where people have the basic essentials already stocked away. TC-1 is where 50 knot or greater winds are expected within 12 hours.  It also means that all facilities, except mission critical components, will be closed and people should fill available containers with drinking water.  While at TC-1 earlier in the day Tuesday, the bas has now been backed down to TC-4 and normal activities can resume.
As for staying informed about the latest, in the States, Kadena's public affairs office says this: ""Stateside friends and family like the Kadena Air Base Facebook page, and many people have already liked that page so they can keep up with what their family and friends are doing overseas.""
 Danas quickly weakened to a tropical storm after crossing the Japanese island of Tsushima, between South Korea and the Japanese mainland. And continued on a northeasterly course.
According to South Korean broadcaster KBS, Busan port closed for a bit as the former typhoon passed the region. The port is South Korea's largest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Typhoon Fitow barrelled into China's east coast early Monday, packing winds of more than 200 kilometres an hour after hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated, state media reported.
At least two people were reported killed, both near Wenzhou in Zhejiang province, the state news agency Xinhua said.
Parts of Zhejiang, which neighbours the commercial hub Shanghai, saw nearly 29 centimetres (11 inches) of rain over 17 hours from Sunday to early Monday, while areas in Fujian to the south saw up to 16 centimetres, the official China News Service said.
In the hard-hit Cangnan county in Wenzhou, more than 1,200 homes collapsed and damages amounted to hundreds of millions of yuan, China National Radio said.
One of the victims, 55-year-old Ni Wenlin, died ""after strong wind blew him off a hill"" late Sunday, Xinhua said, citing municipal flood control authorities.
In Fujian the typhoon broke electricity poles in half, leaving power lines on the ground, and bent iron roadsigns out of shape, CNR reported.
In the coastal city of Ningde, a village leader told the Beijing Times that huge waves had damaged a 200-hectare (490-acre) seaweed farm, which nearly 100 families depended on for their livelihood.
The typhoon ""broke the bamboo poles holding the seaweed in place"", said Lin Fangqin.
The storm is expected to move northwest but ""weaken quickly"", Xinhua said on Monday, citing the National Meteorological Centre (NMC).
Authorities evacuated hundreds of thousands of people and issued China's highest alert on Sunday as Fitow approached the mainland.
The NMC issued a red alert for the storm, which was packing winds of up to 151 kilometres (94 miles) an hour late Sunday night as it moved towards the coast
Winds rose to 201 km per hour in parts of Wenzhou, the official Xinhua news agency reported later, citing local flood control authorities.
Zhejiang has so far evacuated more than 574,000 people, while in Fujian 177,000 have been displaced, Xinhua said.
Two port workers in Wenzhou were missing and may have fallen into the sea, the agency added.
Zhejiang governor Li Qiang urged local authorities to increase inspections of dams and reservoirs as well as safety checks of chemical plants and other important facilities, Xinhua reported.
The storm also forced the suspension of bullet train services in several cities in Zhejiang, Fujian and Jiangxi provinces, Xinhua said.
Wenzhou's airport cancelled 27 flights Sunday, the agency said.
Xinhua quoted the weather centre as saying it was unusual for a typhoon to come ashore in China's southeast during October, at the end of the storm season.
Chinese maritime authorities also issued red alerts, warning of storm tides and waves, with fishermen urged to return to port and local authorities told to prepare harbour facilities and sea walls for high tides.
In Zhejiang more than 35,000 boats returned to harbour while in Fujian nearly 30,000 vessels were called back, according to Xinhua.
Named after a flower from Micronesia, Fitow has hit just two weeks after Typhoon Usagi wreaked havoc in the region, leaving at least 25 reported dead in southern China.
Fitow, which Xinhua described as the 23rd storm to hit China this year, earlier passed through Japan's southern Okinawan island chain, forcing flight cancellations and causing power outages.
Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau had issued a warning over the storm Sunday morning as it surged past the north of the island.
A total of 103 international flights were cancelled in Taiwan, while 14 flights were delayed. Seventeen ferry services between Taiwan and offshore islands were also halted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"As per forecasts discussed in our blog last week, Cyclone Phailin struck the east coast of India over the weekend with winds estimated at near 130 mph.
It brought a strong storm surge along the coast and more than 230 mm (9 inches) of rain was recorded as the cyclone passed.
The cyclone was of a similar strength to one which struck just a little further up the coast in 1999, which claimed more than 10,000 lives.
Excellent forecasts for Phailin, combined with well executed warning and evacuation procedures, meant the loss of life was much less this time around.
Phailin became a tropical storm a little more than three days before landfall, but computer models were able to give far greater warning than this.
Medium range prediction models suggested a higher risk of cyclone formation in the Bay of Bengal a full nine days before Cyclone Phailin struck.
At six days ahead, shorter range models were predicting that the north-eastern coast of India could be under threat, although the timing was not certain at that stage.
Four days ahead, computer models were able to pinpoint the location and timing of landfall to a high degree of accuracy _ all before the storm was strong enough to be named.
Cyclone Phailin originated from a disturbance in the far west Pacific basin and was one of a series of tropical storms seen in this region recently.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Heavy rainfall was expected all through the weekend in northern and northeastern Taiwan due to the approach of Typhoon Fitow, the Central Weather Bureau said Saturday.
The bureau issued a land warning for Taipei, New Taipei, Keelung and Yilan Saturday afternoon, though it added that torrential rain was possible as far south as Taichung and Nantou County.
At 9 p.m. Saturday, Fitow was located about 440 kilometers east of Taipei and moving west-north-west at a speed of 19 km per hour, according to the weather bureau. The storm was packing sustained winds of 137 km per hour with gusts of up to 173 km per hour. The storm’s route was 20 to 40 km more southerly than originally expected, which meant Taoyuan and Hsinchu could eventually also be covered by the land warnings, reports said.
By early Sunday afternoon, the center of the storm would have moved to 240 km northeast of Taipei over the ocean, the bureau said. The eye of the typhoon was unlikely to make landfall but nevertheless, forecasters still cautioned residents to be prepared for strong winds and heavy rains as well as flooding and mudslides, even in southern mountain areas.
The total amount of rainfall in the north could reach 350 millimeter over the next 24 hours, according to the bureau. The highest amount of rain Saturday until 9:20 p.m. was the 151 mm recorded in New Taipei City’s Wulai District.
Sea warnings were also in effect on Taiwan’s east side and in most of the Taiwan Straits with the exception of the Kaohsiung and Pingtung coastal areas. Strong waves were expected to hit most coastal areas, including those of Orchid Island and Green Island in the southeast, the bureau said.
The typhoon would leave Taiwan behind on Monday, but another storm was already on the way, according to the bureau.
The next tropical storm on the horizon, Danas, was unlikely to speed up sufficiently to combine forces with Fitow, experts said. Fitow was expected to make landfall in China Monday and to weaken considerably thereafter, while Danas was likely to move in the direction of Japan, though it was not clear yet how serious its impact on Taiwan might be. Some forecasters have suggested that the storm might affect the island’s Double Ten National Day celebrations Thursday.
President Ma Ying-jeou and Premier Jiang Yi-huah visited the national emergency center late Saturday afternoon to receive an overview of the situation, reports said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sections of highways were shut and more than 350 buses from Wenzhou were cancelled.
Forecasters said the storm was expected to move northwest but weaken quickly.
But continued rainstomes were expected due to another typhoon, Danas, which was set to hit Japan's main islands on Monday.
Packing winds of up to 180 kilometres per hour near its centre, Danas was battering the southern Japanese chain of Okinawa, where more than 50 flights at Naha airport were cancelled while schools were shut, according to local media.
The Japanese meteorological agency issued an alert for strong winds and high waves, while urging residents to remain on guard for floods and landslides as well as lightning and tornadoes.
Local authorities in Okinawa and Kagoshima separately issued evacuation advisories to some 6,500 households, public broadcaster NHK said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Millions of residents were affected as a rainstorm hit a large swathe of eastern China on Tuesday, flooding downtown areas and snarling traffic.
The storm, triggered under the influence of Typhoon Fitow, continued to strike Shanghai and Zhejiang province, forcing both to raise the rainstorm alarm to the highest level of red on Tuesday morning.
In the 12 hours up to 11 am on Tuesday Shanghai reported average rainfall of more than 100 millimeters, while on the outskirts of the city 200 mm fell.
Zhang Ruiyi, a chief service officer at the Shanghai Meteorological Bureau, said the storm was caused by the remaining depression from Fitow encountering cold air.
The continuous rain, the rising tide and discharge of floodwater from upstream Taihu Lake caused the Huangpu River, which runs through Shanghai, to rise past the warning line on Tuesday.
According to the city's flood control headquarters, the river burst its flood control wall in suburban sections. No deaths were reported in the region.
In Zhejiang, Yuyao, a city with a population of about 850,000, was one of the hardest hit. More than 70 percent of the city's downtown area was flooded, forcing public transportation to be suspended.
The city's power and tap water supplies were also interrupted, and residents are short of food and clean water. Soldiers rushed in large trucks and speedboats to help with disaster response.
But relief for residents in the region is on the way, with forecasters in Shanghai predicting cloudy weather on Wednesday and clear skies from Thursday.
Meteorological authorities in Zhejiang lowered the red rainstorm alarm at 12:30 pm on Tuesday, saying that most areas of the province will remain cloudy on Wednesday and Thursday, with showers in some areas.
Typhoon Danas, following on the heels of Fitow, has turned northeast in the Pacific and is unlikely to make landfall on the Chinese mainland. Meteorologists warned that high winds will hit the east coast although Danas has been weakening.
The death toll from Fitow and the rainstorm it generated has risen to six with another four missing in Zhejiang.
Figures from the provincial flood control headquarters show that by 6 pm on Monday more than 6.31 million people had been affected, with 4,000 houses flattened.
Floods also damaged hundreds of thousands of hectares of crops, killed more than 11,000 livestock, disrupted traffic and telecommunications, put dams and reservoirs at risk and caused direct economic losses of 8.4 billion yuan ($1.37 billion) in Zhejiang.
Li Minji, an official at Hangzhou's flood control department, said flooding was reported in 31 communities and 58 sections of roads in the city on Tuesday, with emergency workers busy clearing floodwaters and bringing in traffic controls.
The water level at popular tourist attraction West Lake rose to 7.48 meters on Tuesday, 0.18 meters higher than the danger level.
In Shanghai, pictures posted by Internet users showed a flooded classroom at Tongji University, two residents in Songjiang district rowing a boat on a flooded road, and a bus nearly submerged in a low-lying area.
Cheng Xu, 40, was just one of many people caught out by the floods on Monday. Her flight, due to arrive at Hangzhou airport at 7 am, was delayed for four hours. A shuttle bus then took two and a half hours to make a journey usually taking 45 minutes.
After she got off the bus, it took her another two hours to get close to her home, with traffic controls in place on the road to her apartment building because of the flooding.
""No cars were allowed on that road. I dragged my suitcases, weighing almost 20 kilograms, and walked in heavy rain from the street to my apartment,"" she said.
Zhu Zheng, who lives in Hangzhou's Yuhang district, said he woke up to find floodwater inside at least 12 cars in the area.

The National Meteorological Centre issued a red alert for the storm, saying it was expected to make landfall in China late Sunday or early Monday somewhere between the south of Zhejiang province and the north of Fujian province.
The storm, which the centre classified as ""strong"" with winds up to 151 kilometres (94 miles) an hour, was located Sunday afternoon about 280 kilometres southeast of the city of Wenzhou in Zhejiang and moving at a speed of 18 kilometres an hour.
Zhejiang has so far evacuated more than 130,000 people ahead of the expected landfall, state news agency Xinhua said.

Chinese maritime authorities also issued red alerts, warning of storm tides and waves kicked up by Fitow.
Fishermen were urged to return to port and local authorities were told to prepare harbour facilities and sea walls for high tides.
Fitow, named after a flower from Micronesia, comes just two weeks after Typhoon Usagi wreaked havoc in the region.

Typhoon Surigae was about 500 kilometers (310 miles) east of Infanta town in Quezon province on Monday afternoon with sustained winds of 195 kilometers (121 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 240 kph (149 mph). It is forecast to slowly move northwestward and then veer eastward away from the northern Philippines around Thursday.
Vicente Malano, administrator of the government weather agency, said a high pressure area extending from China to Japan was blocking the typhoon from blowing inland.
“We’re lucky it’s not going to make landfall because if it hits land, it’s really going to be super devastating,” said Ariel Rojas from the weather agency.
The typhoon’s 900-kilometer (560-mile) band of rainclouds and strong winds nevertheless flooded at least 22 villages and caused power outages in four provinces. More than 3,200 people and 43 ferries and cargo ships were stranded in seaports after the coast guard suspended sea travel as the typhoon blew nearer, the government disaster-response agency and the coast guard said.

wildfires,Australian wildfires declared among the 'worst wildlife disasters in modern history',"Nearly 3 billion animals were affected by Australia's worst wildfire season that burned from last July through March, scientists announced Tuesday — a figure almost three times higher than original estimates.
The report released Tuesday and commissioned by the World Wide Fund for Nature Australia said more than 46 million acres were scorched. An estimate in January said 1.25 billion animals were affected.
""This ranks as one of the worst wildlife disasters in modern history,” Dermot O’Gorman, the organization's chief executive officer, said in a statement. ""It’s hard to think of another event anywhere in the world in living memory that has killed or displaced that many animals.""
Ten researchers from Australian universities and wildlife groups involved in the report have been looking at both the impact of the fires and the possible ways to protect ecosystems in the future.
The affected wildlife includes 143 million mammals, 2.46 billion reptiles, 180 million birds and 51 million frogs.
""It's almost impossible to comprehend how many individuals that actually means,"" Lily van Eeden, a researcher at the University of Sydney and a co-author of the report, told NBC News.
The jump in the estimated animals affected compared to the January report is due to a wider geographic area being studied and new data on wildlife, she said.
Despite the increased scope of the research, Van Eeden cautioned, the estimate is still ""quite conservative.""
Invertebrate species — such as spiders and butterflies — were not included and neither was a range of wildlife that lives in waterways like turtles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wildfires,Wildfires: Australia needs national monitoring agency,"Just before the COVID-19 pandemic, bush fires in Australia destroyed more than 3,000 homes and burnt millions of hectares of vegetation. The crisis exposed the nation’s fire monitoring system as being unfit for purpose. Precise real-time information about the area burnt and the intensity of the fires was not available when it was needed.
Australia does not have a central system for gathering and storing essential information about bush fires. State and territory governments, and even agencies within states, have different approaches. This worked fine when fires were smaller. But those in the 2019_20 season crossed multiple state borders.
The blazes engulfed a huge geographic range and burnt for a duration and intensity that was beyond the experience of communities and fire managers1. Many Australians endured five months of smoke pollution that breached national air-quality standards. Usually, people would experience shorter bouts covering smaller areas2.
The extraordinary scale and intensity of the fires were driven by climate conditions not seen in a century: three years of drought, including three consecutive, anomalously dry winters3. This weather is consistent with predictions that global warming will result in conditions that increase the risk of fire4,5. Studies have linked extreme bush-fire seasons over the past few years to anthropogenic climate change
Debate over the cause of the bush fires became politically charged. Fire scientists and managers had to stem misinformation from politicians and the media suggesting that the fires were not unusual historically and were not linked to climate change. There were even suggestions that the fires were the result of arson, or of inappropriate land management8_10. Staggering environmental consequences were claimed, including greenhouse-gas emissions that were exceeded only by those in China, the United States, India, Russia and Japan, and the loss or displacement of more than one billion native vertebrates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wildfires,Australia's wildfire crisis: Key numbers behind the disaster,"SYDNEY (BLOOMBERG) - Australia is in the grip of deadly wildfires burning across the country, triggering an emotive debate about the impact of climate change in the world's driest-inhabited continent. The unprecedented scale of the crisis, and images of terrified tourists sheltering on beaches from the inferno, have shocked many Australians.
With summer only just beginning and the nation affected by a prolonged drought, the authorities fear the death toll will continue to mount as more homes and land are destroyed. Here are some key details of the crisis:
How many people have died?
Since the fire season began months ago during the southern hemisphere winter, 23 people have died. With six people missing in Victoria state, the authorities fear the death toll will rise. Among the fatalities are volunteer firefighters, including a young man who died when his 10-tonne truck was flipped over in what officials have described as a ""fire tornado"".

On a deadly 24-hour march through the Sierra Nevada in September, the flames of what would become the North Complex fire raced through more than 200,000 acres of dense timber, destroyed a historic schoolhouse and overtook a beloved camp for children with cancer.
Also in its path was the remote settlement of Berry Creek, where Daniel Salazar, 27, found himself once again facing an unprecedented, out of control blaze. Less than two years earlier, Salazar had escaped the Camp fire, which killed his grandparents and 83 others in and around the town of Paradise.
In the Sierra Nevada and across California in late summer and early fall this year, firefighters and residents fought a losing battle against impossibly fast and ferocious blazes.
It was the state’s worst wildfire season on record. By the end of it, the flames had killed 31 people, destroyed or damaged more than 10,000 buildings and burned a staggering 4.1m acres. The North Complex fire was responsible for more than 300,000 acres of scorched land, killing 16 people in its wake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here's Why","Large wildfires raging throughout California have claimed at least 44 lives statewide, destroyed thousands of structures and prompted hundreds of thousands to evacuate. A fire actively burning in Northern California took at least 42 lives, becoming the deadliest fire on state record.
Large fires have scorched populated areas of California over the past week, including the Camp Fire, north of Sacramento, which incinerated the entire town of Paradise, and the Woolsey Fire, which burns northwest of Los Angeles. Firefighters on Monday also battled the Rocky Peak fire, which sprung up near where the Woolsey fire began and forced the shutdown of the Route 118 freeway. The Camp Fire has become one of California’s most destructive fires in at least a century, according to the Associated Press.
Wildfires are a natural and annual occurrence in California, typically appearing toward the end of the long, dry summers. In four out of five cases, people provide the igniting spark. At the same time, the environment has also become more flammable. As the state grows hotter and increasingly subject to prolonged droughts, and as more people live in high risk areas, the fires simply get bigger, more severe and more costly to put out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thousands of weary firefighters, who have been battling wildfires for a month, have been fighting nearly 100 blazes in New South Wales state.
The mega fire north of Sydney, Australia‘s largest city, was created on Friday when several fires merged and was now burning across 335,000 hectares.
“We need flooding rain to put these fires out. That’s really what is going to stop it,” said the New South Wales Rural Fire Service. “These will take many weeks to put out.”
Wildfires are common in Australia during the hot summer, which begins in December, but this year the fires started much earlier, blamed on soaring temperatures, dry winds and arson.
A three-year drought has left much of Australia tinder dry.
The fires around Sydney have been pumping such vast amounts of smoke into the air that they appear as significant rain on the radars, the Bureau of Meteorology said on Twitter.
New South Wales Health said late on Friday that some 1,140 people had sought medical assistance for breathing issues or asthma in the past week _ a quarter more than in a typical week. NSW Ambulance fielded about a third more calls.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the blaze as “a catastrophe, the likes of which we have not yet known”.
He appealed to Russia, Cyprus, Greece and Italy for help in putting out the fire, which began on the slopes of the Carmel hill, southeast of Israel’s port city of Haifa, and rapidly spread.
Cyprus and Greece agreed to dispatch firefighting helicopters.
Some nine hours after the blaze was estimated to have begun exhausted firefighters, those from Haifa reinforced by teams from all over Israel, and by soldiers, were still struggling to bring it under control, but without success.
“We’ve lost control of the fire,” a spokesman for Haifa’s firefighting services was quoted as saying.
Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovich said it was impossible to say when the fire could be brought under control. However, firefighters were speculated that as the fire spread west a major road linking Haifa with Tel Aviv to the south could act as a natural firebreak, or, failing that, the sea would.
At least 22 people were confirmed dead, but other accounts put the number as high as 40.
The fatalities were prison guards who had been drafted to help evacuate the 500 prisoners from a jail in the path of the flames. Their bus, with 50 people on board, was trapped by a falling tree and 40 of them burned to death. The others were injured.

“Anybody, whether they’re businesses, whether they’re residences, camping or anything else, everybody has been evacuated from the area,” said Bureau of Land Management spokeswoman Cass Cairns.
By Monday evening, winds with gusts of 20 mph to 30 mph had pushed the fire northeast from the intersection of U.S. 50 and Colorado 9 over 700 acres. Smoke and poor visibility closed U.S. 50 6 miles west of Ca?on City.
The Fremont County Sheriff’s Office called 177 businesses and residents asking them to evacuate. Cairns said it was unclear how many structures had burned or whether any were homes.
Smoke from the fire burning in an area known as Parkdale could be seen and smelled in Colorado Springs on Monday night.
The National Weather Service issued a red flag warning for the region, advising that strong winds and relatively low humidity might cause the fire to spread.
About 50 firefighters were battling the fire on the ground, supported by a fleet of aircraft dropping flame retardant, Cairns said. These included one large air tanker, a single-engine plane, a large helicopter and a smaller helicopter.
Mike Bandera, general manager of the Royal Gorge Bridge, said the historic bridge was not threatened but that homes along Fremont County Road 61 were evacuated.
Bandera said he first saw the flames about 1:30 p.m. Monday, jumping as high as 20 feet into the air.
Overnight, firefighters will continue to monitor the blaze and create fire breaks to minimize the spread. They will fight the fire depending on the direction it is headed, how active it is and on firefighter safety, Cairns said.

Incident Commander Rich Harvey concurred. “I hate wind  Wind is big factor in how we do this fire. It won’t stay in the same place. The winds keep shifting on us.”
He said fire managers are expecting thunderstorms as a cold front moves in from Denver.
A lot of people expressed concern because Wednesday’s weather mirrors Tuesday’s. Harvey said everyone saw firsthand how quickly the fire can move.
“We’re learning its tricks,” Harvey said of the fire’s propensity to make quick runs.

""We do have a Type 1 team mobilizing to the site,"" said Heather Hawkins with Sustainable Resource Development. ""They are the most experienced and most well trained fire managers.""
The fire is estimated at more than 100,000 hectares, but heavy smoke makes it difficult to be more precise, she said.
Firefighters are holding a fire about 10 kilometres from the oil and gas hamlet of Zama City, about 930 kilometres northwest of Edmonton.
About 130 people were evacuated from their homes to hotels and a school in High Level, Alta., late Tuesday night when winds picked up and began pushing the fire south towards the hamlet.
""The high pressure ridge that was sitting over northern Alberta started to break down which means we had some strong winds start to pick up,"" said SRD spokesperson Rob Harris. ""That's what really fanned the fires.""
SRD recommended the hamlet evacuate immediately and Mackenzie County agreed to issue a mandatory evacuation order, he said.
Zama resident Janet Hackett said she got a sense around 4 p.m. Tuesday that people would have to leave. The family had their bags packed and ready to go when the evacuation order was issued.
""The town was becoming really, really smoky, and the skies were really red and grey, so we knew that it was getting pretty intense,"" she said.
The family then drove along a dirt road for two hours to reach High Level.

wildfires,,"Wildfires, peat fires and controlled burns on farming lands kill 339,000 people worldwide each year, said a study released on Saturday that is the first to estimate a death toll for landscape fires.
Most of those deaths are concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa, where an estimated 157,000 people die as a result of being exposed to such fires annually, with southeast Asia ranking second with 110,000 deaths.
""I was surprised at our estimate being so high when you consider that the exposure to fire smoke is quite intermittent for most people,"" said lead author Fay Johnston of the University of Tasmania.
""Even in southeast Asia and Africa, (fire) is a seasonal phenomenon. It is not year round,"" Johnston said at the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting in Vancouver where she presented her research.
The study, which Johnston said was the first of its kind to attempt to estimate a death toll from wildfires and landscape burns, was published Saturday in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives.
Researchers looked at the number of deaths from all causes in areas that were exposed to heavy smoke and landscape fire between 1997 and 2006.
They used satellite data and chemical transport models to assess the health impacts of particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers, a major byproduct of landscape fire smoke.
The number of deaths from wildfires came in far below the previously estimated global tolls for indoor air pollution at two million people per year and urban air pollution at 800,000.
However, the study authors said their findings indicated that ""fire emissions are an important contributor to global mortality.""
The research also suggested a significant link between climate and fire mortality.
About twice as many people died during El Nino years when the surface ocean temperature rises in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean (averaging 532,000) as during cooler La Nina years (averaging 262,000).",https://phys.org/news/2012-02-wildfires-people-year.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This year, officials believe target shooting or other firearms use have sparked at least 21 wildfires in Utah and nearly a dozen in Idaho. Shooting is also believed to have caused fires in Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico.
Officials have been asking the public to scale back shooting as legions of firefighters contend with one of the busiest and most destructive wildfire seasons to ever hit the West.
But many in the region avid proponents of the Second Amendment right to bear arms, so most state lawmakers are hesitant to enact any formal restrictions.

“[The fire] started on private land and it’s moved west/northwest on to national forest land, southwest of Petersburg,” according to Sarah Hankens with the U.S. Forest Service.
The blaze is 20 percent contained. It’s being called the North Mountain Fire and so far has destroyed 720 acres.
Bob Beanblossom with the U.S. Forest Service said crews are having a hard time reaching some parts of the fire because of the terrain in the Potomac Highlands.
“It is steep, rocky terrain. There are a lot of standing, dead trees that firefighters have to be careful of. It does certainly pose some hazards.” Beanblossom said half the battle is reaching those remote areas.
The fire is so large, the U.S. Forest Service has called in crews from out west.
“We have a lot of folks here from the Monongahela National Forest but there are crews from as far west as Oregon, Idaho and Washington,” explained Beanblossom.
Even more foresters are set to arrive from Tennessee, Virginia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Wisconsin.
Most of the fire is contained within the national forest and that’s where crews want to keep it.
“There is private property adjacent to the forest, not too far from where the fire is located,” said Hankens. “We do have personnel out on the fire line assessing both direct and indirect ways to create fire lines to try and keep the fire on national forest.”
So far, that part of Pendleton County has not seen any of the rain or snow much of the state received Tuesday morning.

The fire continued to move east on Highway 32 throughout the night and into Friday morning.
Increased winds from the southeast pushed the fire over Highway 32 where another section of land, just west of Council Bluff Lake, was devastated, forcing the highway’s closure. It has been closed from highway 49 south to Route A.
Council Bluffs campground is still open as of press time, but may be difficult to get to, and the campground could be closed if it becomes necessary.

Forest Service Regional Coordinator Troy Ducheneaux said firefighters continued to deal with the fire his agency is calling the Double Diamond wildfire, going house-to-house in areas hit by the blaze to search for possible victims.
“We’ve got several areas we are addressing. We have broken the fire area into basically three different zones,” he said. “The (National) Park Service area is taking care of their area of responsibility, and we have broken up the Fritch area into two different divisions. We’ve got two different crews working in those areas; they are addressing those hot spots.
“The plan for later today and into (Tuesday) is to continue to improve contingency lines with dozers we have in place that are working the areas to ensure that we get this thing totally wrapped up.”
Earlier Monday, Fritch Police Chief Monte Leggett told some residents they probably won’t be able to return to their homes until Tuesday morning at the earliest.
“We’ve got crews still in the area. They are mopping it up at this point. We’ve got a lot of hot spots. You know how yuccas and mesquite are. They don’t want to go out,” Leggett said. “Lake Meredith Harbor is still in full evacuation. No one in, no one out. The majority of the destruction was in the Lake Meredith Harbor subdivision.”
About 2,100 people were evacuated from areas threatened by the fire overnight, Ducheneaux said.
They were housed in several shelters.

This image, taken on March 7, 2014, by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Aqua satellite, shows fires outlined in red. The fires burn in peat forests, which produce dense smoke when they burn. Fire detections from the MODIS sensors on both the Aqua and Terra satellites play a significant role in monitoring burning in Indonesia. This image shows around 400 fire detections, meaning that MODIS detected at least one fire in about 400 one-kilometer pixels.
According to local news reports, some of the more intense fires are burning in the Giam Siak Kecil-Bukit Batu biosphere reserve and were deliberately set to clear land for palm oil plantations. The Giam Siak Kecil-Bukit Batu biosphere reserve contains just over 700,000 hectares of peat forest that sustains a wide range of plant and animal species including the Sumatra tiger, elephant, tapir, and sun bear.
It is illegal to set fires to clear land in Indonesia, but the practice is common. The chief of the Indonesian National Disaster Mitigation Agency told ANTARA News that 99 percent of the fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan were deliberately set. Most fires occur during the dry season between April and October.

Intense wildfires have been surging across southern and northern California with little reprieve for firefighters or residents for several weeks. The intensity of the flames has increased because of the sudden heat wave sweeping into peak wildfire season. Last week fires burned over 250 acres across the Sierra Nevada foothills, and over 70,000 acres have been burned east of Sacramento by what’s being called the King fire, forcing thousands to flee their homes.

wildfires,,"Nearly three billion animals _ mammals, reptiles, birds, and frogs _ were killed or displaced by Australia’s devastating 2019-20 bushfires.
It’s almost three times an earlier estimate released in January.
The breakdown is 143 million mammals, 2.46 billion reptiles, 180 million birds, and 51 million frogs.
Those figures are revealed in an interim report entitled Australia’s 2019-2020 Bushfires: The Wildlife Toll, commissioned by the World Wide Fund for Nature and believed to be world first research.
Ten scientists from the University of Sydney, University of New South Wales, University of Newcastle, Charles Sturt University, and BirdLife Australia contributed the majority of the work.
The project is being led by Dr Lily Van Eeden and overseen by Professor Chris Dickman, both from the University of Sydney.
While results are still being finalised, the headline figure of nearly three billion animals impacted is unlikely to change.
“The interim findings are shocking. It’s hard to think of another event anywhere in the world in living memory that has killed or displaced that many animals. This ranks as one of the worst wildlife disasters in modern history,” said WWF-Australia CEO Dermot O’Gorman.
“When you think about nearly three billion native animals being in the path of the fires it is absolutely huge, it’s a difficult number to comprehend,” said Professor Dickman.
While the scientists cannot say how many animals died, Professor Dickman said the prospects for animals which escaped the flames were “probably not that great” because of a lack of food and shelter or being forced into habitat already occupied.
In January, Professor Dickman, working with WWF scientists, produced an early estimate that 1.25 billion animals were impacted. However, that calculation focused only on the states of New South Wales and Victoria.
Dr Van Eeden said for this project the team examined a fire impact area of 11.46 million hectares.
“We believe a continent-wide assessment of the number of animals that might be impacted has never been done in Australia before or anywhere else in the world. Other nations can build upon this research to improve understanding of bushfire impacts everywhere,” Dr Van Eeden said.
Mr O’Gorman said with extreme fires becoming more frequent because of climate change the interim findings “give other countries a window into the future of mega fires and their devastating impact on wildlife”.
He said the research had also been released in time to be considered by the review of Australia’s flagship environment law _ the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act.
“Following such a heavy toll on Australia’s wildlife, strengthening this law has never been more important. WWF will continue to advocate for policies that benefit both people and nature, restore what has been lost, and ensure we build back a more resilient Australia,” Mr O’Gorman said.
Professor Dickman said the research shows people that mega fires are changing the environment and depleting native biodiversity and change is necessary.
“How quickly can we decarbonise? How quickly can we stop our manic land clearing? We land clear at a rate that’s one of the highest in the world,” Professor Dickman said.
The recommendations in the interim report call for addressing knowledge gaps on wildlife densities and responses to fire, improving habitat connectivity to help mobile species escape fire, identifying and protecting unburnt habitat crucial to threatened species, improving fire prevention and management, and establishing rapid response teams to help species impacted by fire.

wildfires,,"In the wake of the enormous fires that have razed huge swathes of drought-stricken Australia, scientists fear that when rains eventually fall, they will wash charred debris into rivers, dams, and the ocean, killing wildlife and even tainting the drinking supplies of major cities, such as Sydney.
For many weeks, ash, soot, and blackened gum tree leaves have collected along the shorelines of Sydney’s beaches, clogging the waves and lapping in the tide. Originating in fires blazing in forested areas to the west, the debris has been carried on the breeze along with the pungent bushfire smoke that blanketed Australia’s largest city for much of December.
But what has carried on the wind is just a taste of the huge quantities of debris that are likely to wash into rivers once there are heavy downpours. As of press time, more than 26 million acres—an area bigger than Portugal—have now burned, mostly in the continent’s southeast. That includes areas of land known as catchments—also called watersheds—where rainfall begins its earthly journey into specific rivers, lakes, and dams.
It is an ecological disaster unprecedented in Australia’s history, and that spells trouble for drinking water supplies, coastal ecosystems, and the freshwater rivers that support iconic Australian wildlife, such as the platypus.

In a special edition of the journal Nature Climate Change, Australian researchers examined several other aspects of the blazes, including investigations into their extent and possible causes.
One study showed that between September 2019 and January 2020 around 5.8 million hectares of broadleaf forest were burned in New South Wales and Victoria.
This accounts for roughly 21 percent of the nation's forested area, making this fire season proportionately the most devastating on record.

The number of forest fires in Brazil's Amazon rainforest increased 28% in July in comparison to last year, the country's National Institute for Space Research reported Saturday.
Brazil holds around 60% of the Amazon basin region and environmentalists say this area is vital to containing the impact of climate change.
The state agency recorded 6,803 fires in the Amazon last month, compared to 5,318 in the same month of 2019.
Environmentalists were alarmed by the figure, particularly because August traditionally marks the beginning of the fire season in the region. Many now fear that a repeat of the large surge in fires that devastated the area last August could occur this year again.

Satellites in September recorded 32,017 hotspots in the world’s largest rainforest, a 61% rise from the same month in 2019.
In August last year, surging fires in the Amazon captured global headlines and prompted criticism from world leaders such as France’s Emmanuel Macron that Brazil was not doing enough to protect the rainforest.
On Tuesday, the US Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, called for a world effort to offer $20bn to end Amazon deforestation and threatened Brazil with unspecified “economic consequences” if it did not “stop tearing down the forest”.
President Jair Bolsonaro lambasted Biden’s comment as a “cowardly threat” to Brazil’s sovereignty and a “clear sign of contempt”.
Data from Inpe released on Thursday showed that in 2019, fires spiked in August and declined considerably the month after, but this year’s peak has been more sustained. Both August and September of 2020 have matched or surpassed last year’s single-month high.
“We have had two months with a lot of fire. It’s already worse than last year,” said Ane Alencar, science director for Brazil’s Amazon Environmental Research Institute (Ipam).
“It could get worse if the drought continues. We are at the mercy of the rain.”
The Amazon is experiencing a more severe dry season than last year, which scientists attribute in part to warming in the tropical North Atlantic Ocean pulling moisture away from South America.
The entire Amazon, which spans nine countries, currently has 28,892 active fires, according to a fire monitoring tool funded in part by the US space agency, Nasa.
The fires in September are not only burning recently deforested areas and farmland, where ranchers set them to clear land, but are also increasingly burning virgin forest, a worrying trend that suggests the rainforest is becoming drier and more prone to fire.
Roughly 62% of major Amazon fires were in forests in September, compared with only 15% in August, according to an analysis of satellite images by the US-based non-profit Amazon Conservation.
The warming of the North Atlantic is also helping drive drought in the Brazilian Pantanal, the world’s largest wetland, which has suffered more fires this year than ever previously recorded, according to Inpe data.
A Federal University of Rio de Janeiro analysis found that 23% of the wetlands, which are home to the densest population of jaguars in the world, has burned.

Since Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro took office, governmental measures to curb illegal fires have shown little impact, as flames and deforestation erase vast swathes of the world's biggest rainforest.
Most fires in the Amazon are set by land-grabbers and wildcat ranchers, seeking to transform parts of the rainforest into their own lucrative agricultural enterprises. And this August was a particularly bad time for such fires: Preliminary data collected by the National Spatial Research Institute (INPE) show 29,307 fires in the Brazilian Amazon last month.
However, due to a technical issue with the NASA satellite tracking fires, experts say that figure could be even higher. The final tally of fires recorded in August is expected to rise 2% above the August 2019 total, says Albert Setzer, INPE's senior scientist -- which would make this August the worst in 10 years.
The more fires there are, the faster the rainforest is transformed into grasslands for illicit cattle and soy-growing operations.

wildfires,,"Kangaroo Island is Australia’s third largest. Its glossy black cockatoos have been one of Australia’s conservation success stories. Thanks to a recovery program that began in 1995, their numbers in the wild increased from 150 to 400. Scientists responded by downgrading the birds’ status from critically endangered with extinction to just endangered.
But that all changed in January. Now this bird is part of an unfolding horror story.
Fires have raged across nearly 50 percent of Kangaroo Island. That’s their 4,400-square-kilometer (1,700-square-mile) isle off the coast of the state of South Australia. Flames destroyed the habitat for most of the birds. It’s unclear how many glossy black cockatoos survived. For those that did, food may now be scarce. These birds eat the seeds of a single tree species: the drooping she oak.
Many years of hard work to save these birds have gone up in smoke, says Daniella Teixeira. She’s a conservation biologist who works 2,184 kilometers (some 1,360 miles) away at Australia’s University of Queensland in Brisbane. This fire has brought “a big step backwards for the recovery team,” Teixeira concludes. And it’s something she understands well. She has studied and worked to protect these cockatoos for the last four years.

wildfires,,"One year has passed since the world was shocked by the images of the fires blazing across the Amazon in Brazil. But since then, the forest hasn’t stopped burning —and 2020 could be even more devastating for the rainforest and the Indigenous Peoples who call it home. Last week, Greenpeace Brazil flew over the state of Mato Grosso to capture images of the Amazon. Even though the government had ordered a ban on forest fires in the state starting at the beginning of July, the photos show smoke, flames, and just how ineffective the ban has been.
Last year, more than 1 million hectares of forest were burned, and the trend shows the destruction is far from over. Last June, more than two thousand fire hotspots were registered in the Amazon, the highest number in the last thirteen years. Since Brazil’s President Bolsonaro took office in January 2019, his government’s agenda has been very clear: dismantle environmental protection law and agencies, so that forest destroyers can burn the forest freely, clearing the land to turn it into pastures, without being held accountable. 
The consequences of this destruction are dire. From Siberia to the Amazon, fires are raging across the world. Losing our forests means losing the fight against the climate crisis, putting biodiversity at risk of extinction, and threatening the lives of Indigenous Peoples who depend on the forest standing for their survival. Fighting to protect the forest and Indigenous lands from fires and deforestation become even more difficult—and crucial —during a pandemic. 
With a mortality rate from COVID-19 150% higher than the Brazilian average, Indigenous Peoples are already more vulnerable during the pandemic. The smoke from the fires will put their respiratory system at even higher risk during a time when access to healthcare is limited in remote areas in the Amazon.
But things can be different. After the public’s outcry last year, there is increasing pressure on Brazil’s government. Investors, companies and governments have been signaling their concerns about the destruction of the forest and its impact on the environment, and their message is clear: they don’t want to do business with forest destroyers. Even though last week Bolsonaro announced a “fire moratorium” for 120 days, the images of Mato Grosso show how his measures have been performative and inefficient.",https://www.greenpeace.org/international/story/44159/fires-brazil-bolsonaro-amazon-deforestation-2020/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wildfires,,"The number of fires in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest jumped 28% in July from a year ago, official data showed on Saturday, as some environmentalists warned a jump this week could signal a repeat of last year’s surging destruction of the world’s largest rainforest.
Brazil’s space research agency Inpe recorded 6,803 fires in the Amazon last month, up from 5,318 in July 2019.
Although that is a three-year high for July, the figure pales in comparison to last year’s peak of 30,900 fires in August _ a nine-year high for that month.
Still, environmental groups say there are worrying signs of what may come, with the final days of the month showing a sharp spike. More than 1,000 fires were registered on July 30, the highest number for a single day in July since 2005, according to an analysis by advocacy group Greenpeace Brasil.
“It’s a terrible sign,” said Ane Alencar, science director at Brazil’s Amazon Environmental Research Institute (IPAM). “We can expect that August will already be a difficult month and September will be worse yet.”Environmental advocates blame right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro for emboldening illegal loggers, miners and land speculators to destroy the forest with his vision of economic development for the region. Bolsonaro defends his plans to introduce mining and farming in protected reserves as a way to lift the region out of poverty.
This year, the president authorized a military deployment from May to November to combat deforestation and forest fires. He has also banned setting fires in the region for 120 days.
In 2019, Brazil instituted the same temporary policies later in the year, only after fires in the Amazon provoked global outcry in August.
Scientists say the rainforest is a vital defense against climate warming because it absorbs greenhouse gases.
Non-government organization Amazon Conservation says it has tracked 62 major fires for the year as of July 30. Many of those came after July 15, when the fire ban went into affect, indicating it has not been entirely effective, said Matt Finer, who leads the NGO’s fire tracking project.
The overwhelming majority of large fires, where elevated levels of aerosols in the smoke indicate large amounts of burning biomass, happened in recently deforested areas, with none found in virgin forest, Finer said.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-environment-idUSKBN24X3SW,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wildfires,,"Cool and relatively moist, Swedish summers aren’t known for promoting wildfire. Fires occur in most years, but not on the scale or intensity of the blaze that raged through boreal forests in August 2014.
It’s not clear how it got started, but fast-growing fire has consumed V?stmanland since July 31. In a week, the blaze grew to become the largest Sweden has seen in four decades. As of August 8, it had charred more than 150 square kilometers (60 square miles), killed one person, and forced thousands to evacuate their homes.
The Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat 8 captured this natural-color image of the fire on August 4, 2014. Multiple smoke plumes rise from the perimeter of the fire and blow northwest in the wind. Burned forest appears brown; unaffected forests are dark green; farmland is light green; and fallow fields are tan.
Hot and dry weather exacerbated the fire, stressing vegetation and priming it to burn. With a high-pressure system parked over Scandinavia, oppressive heat emerged across Sweden in July and August, bringing record or near-record temperatures to many towns and cities. In Sala, a city close to the fire, temperatures soared to 34.7°C (94.5°F) on August 5. Average temperatures are about 70°F (21°C) in early August.
Wildfires aren’t common or widespread in Sweden. According to a report published by the International Forest Fire News, only a few hundred hectares (100 hectares is equivalent to 1 square kilometer) generally burn during the nation’s wet summers, and a few thousand hectares burn during dry summers. That’s less than 0.02 percent of Sweden’s overall forest cover.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Flaming tule reeds, eight to 10 feet high, burned over a boggy marsh filled with three to four feet of water. Firefighters relied on catwalks to get to the flames, but when the catwalks caught fire they had to slog through the marsh.
The Pittsburg power plant is currently non-operational. So there was no threat of a major power outage. The real threat came from transmission lines above.
""The PG&E transmission lines contain high voltage and in some cases smoke and particulate matter burning from fires can cause arcing between the lines and down to the ground, and that was a concern,"" said Laing.

This is only the fourth time on record the country has reached the 9 million-acre mark, center spokesman Randall Eardley said in an e-mail. The area burned is roughly equivalent to the size of New Jersey and Connecticut combined.
All of the top years for acres burned have occurred since 2000, Eardley said. The worst year occurred in 2006, with 9.8 million acres. In 2007 and 2012, 9.3 million acres were burned, he said. If another 800,000 acres are burned this year, an all-time record would be set.
Accurate wildfire records go back to 1960. Prior to 2000, the U.S. surpassed 7 million acres only one time — in 1963. ""The year 2000 seems to have been a turning point in the number of acres we've seen burned,"" Eardley said.

wildfires,,"There was a time when fire season in California started around May and went through September. Now, thanks to a drought that’s stretching into its fourth year, the state seems to have become a year-round tinderbox.
The long running drought has “created explosive fire conditions,” said Mike Mohler, a fire captain with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE). “Five years ago without a drought in California you would still get wildland fires. But the vegetation wouldn’t burn as quickly. Now there’s zero moisture and you get explosive fire growth.”
The drought has fed into a trend that’s been developing for over the past decade, said Daniel Berlant, chief of public information for CAL FIRE.
“Since 2000 we’ve been seeing larger and more damaging fires,” he said. “What we’re seeing now is that the rain is starting later and stopping much earlier. The fires are burning at explosive speed because the vegetation is so dry and that allows them to get much larger.”
It’s not just the low precipitation that’s the problem, Berlant says. It’s also the higher temperatures.
Those high temperatures are baking the moisture out of the soil and air, leaving vegetation especially dry and vulnerable to catching fire, said Park Williams, an assistant research professor at the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University.
Rising temperatures alone can boost the risk of wildfires, Williams said. “When you see wildfires in the Sierra Nevada and Northern Coast Ranges occurring early in the season it’s a testament to how warm conditions have become in spring,” he adds.
In a recent study published in the International Journal of Wildland Fire, Williams found that, in the Southwest, rising temperatures raised fire risk even in wetter years. That finding is likely to hold true for California, too, he said.
“Forests are excellent gauges of climate because they are not irrigated and they live for a very long time, allowing for tree-ring records and other aspects of forests to tell us how recent conditions fit into a long-term context,” Williams said. “As temperatures rise, the amount of water necessary to reduce a forest’s flammability goes up. In the absence of substantial increases in precipitation, warming causes increased flammability, and that very reliably translates to increased areas of forest burned.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The explosive Valley fire, which broke out in Lake County on Saturday, has overwhelmed firefighters who have scrambled to keep up with its unpredictable nature. Consuming 62,000 acres -- about 97 square miles _ it prompted the local sheriff to declare it the worst tragedy the area had ever seen.
The rain that fell Monday afternoon appeared to be a sign of reprieve, but fire officials warned that that was not the case.

Pittman added that the landscape has become so desiccated that its response to water, even if sprayed directly on grass and trees, is minimal. A shift in other elements -- such as an increase in humidity or a decrease in wind speed -- would actually be more helpful.
The drop in temperature, however, has at least made conditions more comfortable for the 1,800 firefighters on the scene.

In fact, while the national wildfire tally has been below average this year, the average in California has been 38% above average, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Over 4,000 acres have burned in California this year, which is almost double the amount at the same time last year.

Here are ten important facts about wildfires in the Golden State. How many did you know?
There are two distinct wildfire seasons in California: ones driven by Santa Ana winds (usually October to April) and ones generally exacerbated by heat in the summer months (usually June to September). Santa Ana fires spread more quickly, while non-Santa Ana fires spread more slowly and are considered less intense, though they can burn longer.
Climate change will probably worsen wildfires, but wildfires can also make climate change worse. When undisturbed, forests and wildlands capture and store millions of tons of carbon from the atmosphere in California; wildfires release carbon back into the atmosphere, exacerbating climate change. An April 2015 study by the National Park Service and UC Berkeley, published in Forest Ecology and Management, showed that five to seven percent of carbon emissions between 2001 and 2010 came from wildfires.
Look forward to more burned-over landscapes in California. A September 2015 paper published in Environmental Research Letters by scientists from the University of California predicts that California land burned by wildfires will increase in the coming decades. By comparing temperature, wind, and relative humidity in the present climate with projections from five different global climate models, they are able to project that area burned by Santa Ana fires will increase by 64 percent; and the area burned by non-Santa Ana fires will increase by 77 percent. Factors that point to this increase: an increase in more intense Santa Ana winds and an increase in temperatures, both due to climate change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wildfires,,"Several large wildfires have charred tens of thousands of acres in northern California. The largest, the Rocky fire, had burned about 60,000 acres (24,000 hectares) in Lake, Yolo, and Colusa counties as of August 3, 2015. Farther north, the Fork Complex fire and the Mad River Complex fire had burned a combined 39,000 acres.

The cause of the fire is under investigation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wildfires,,"Three factors influence the impact of wildfire risk on property losses: fuel, slope, and access. The primary risk factor is a property’s proximity to vegetation—grass, trees, and scrub or brush—which provides fuel for a fire. Another important factor is topography, or slope, which influences the speed of wildfire spread. Finally, access—or specifically lack of access—is a critical factor. We’ve learned through experience that when properties are on dead-end streets or in single-access neighborhoods, firefighters face added challenges.
In addition to examining those risk factors, our analysis also considered time-dependent, weather-related factors. California experienced extreme drought conditions this past summer, with hardly any rainfall, and we found that to be significant. We also looked at wind patterns.
Even before the Valley and Butte fires erupted, our assessment had placed a large number of properties destroyed or damaged in their wake at high risk based on location and vegetation risk factors. Our modeling also established the Valley and Butte locations as areas with high loss potential before the fires, as illustrated by the map to the right.
As illustrated on the maps below, in both fires we found a significant correlation between burn severity and the proximity of vegetative fuel. As we see more frequently, people are building homes and other structures in the California foothills, former wildlands dominated by vegetation. In such an environment, or wildland-urban interface (or intermix, depending upon proximity to wildland fuels), properties are at a higher risk for loss.
A good number of properties destroyed or damaged in the Valley and Butte fires were located on steep slopes—and steeper slopes can increase the speed and intensity of wildfire. Winds also played a role. We detected anomalous wind patterns, with wind gusts in the area of 30 miles per hour, in both the Valley and Butte fires. Those winds had a role in spreading the fires and making it difficult for firefighters to control the flames. The Valley and Butte wind patterns, however, didn’t approach the magnitude of the infamous 60-mile-per-hour Santa Ana winds, responsible for fanning California’s most devastating wildfires.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wildfires,,"Wildfires can cause overwhelming stress: The red-orange hues beyond the plumes of smoke seemed so far away, but now threaten the only place some have ever called home. Communities of people told they're not in danger one moment are put on high alert the next. There's not always time to grab family photos, your grandmother's ring or your beloved pets. It only takes a few minutes for fires to grow at an incomprehensible velocity, forcing people out of their homes, says Scott Vest, spokesman for the Red Cross' Ogden, Utah, Northern Chapter. He was stationed in Middletown, California, which is about two hours north of San Francisco, for about two weeks _ just days after emergency officials announced on Sept. 15 that 23,000 people had been displaced by wildfires in Northern California this year. More than 300,000 acres have burned in California so far in 2015, and the fires continue.
“When everything has been destroyed and all you have is a pile of ashes, you don’t really have anything to hold on to,” Vest says.
The notion that there's a specific wildfire season is a thing of the past, says Merritt Schreiber, an associate professor of clinical emergency medicine and director of psychological programs at the Center for Disaster Medical Sciences at the University of California—Irvine Medical Center and School of Medicine_. ""The last few years, fire season has become all year long. It's seriously aggravated by the drought, and the drought is a big stressor in the area,"" says Schreiber, who's also director for pediatric trauma psychology consultation services _there.
When Distress Gets Serious
Grant Marshall, a senior behavioral scientist at the RAND Corporation in Santa Monica, California, has focused his research on trauma resulting from wildfires and other disasters. In August, he and other researchers published a study in EcoHealth that examined the psychological distress faced by 1,387 of the 6,000 households displaced by wildfires that burned 733 square miles in Apache County, Arizona, from May through June 2011.
""We found relatively high rates _ 35 percent _ of people who were still experiencing emotional distress that could be indicative of a mental health problem even months after the event took place,"" Marshall says.
Those experiencing such an event might feel more irritable, nervous or anxious or even depressed, Vest says._ They might have detailed memories of the evacuation or witnessing the fire raging toward their community.
Schreiber adds there are two trajectories people tend to take when they've experienced a wildfire or similar disaster that displaces them: distress with resilience and distress without resilience.
""Many people have distress, and many people who have distress are going to have resilience. They're going to bounce back to how they were doing before in a relatively short period of time,"" Schreiber explains, adding that the other group who can't seem to deal may have a greater risk for developing a condition such as _depression or post-traumatic stress disorder.

A light winter snowpack and little rain in the spring left dry ground particularly vulnerable to fires that break out when lightning strikes, said Tim Mowry, a public information officer with the Alaska Division of Forestry.
The total area affected by the fires—roughly 624,000 acres—is not exceptional, but it is spread out over a larger number of separate fires burning in different areas, Mowry said.

wildfires,,"Alaska, the great northern frontier of America, is being reshaped by climate change. While rising temperatures are altering its character and landscape, they are also bringing the ravages of wildfires.
In the past 60 years, Alaska has warmed more than twice as fast as the rest of the country, with average temperatures up by nearly 3°F. By 2050, temperatures are projected to climb an additional 2-4 degrees, with the Arctic region seeing the most dramatic increases. These rising temperatures are expected to increase wildfire risks in Alaska, just as they have in the rest of the western U.S.Wildfires have been on the rise across the western U.S. since the 1970s, at the same time that spring and summer temperatures have increased dramatically, and average spring snowpack has declined substantially.
Fires in Alaska don’t often make news in the lower 48, but they threaten vast expanses of forest, parkland, and tundra that store immense quantities of carbon. The state’s growing number of large wildfires have the potential to damage these ecosystems, and the people and wildlife that depend on them, while releasing a significant amount of carbon into the atmosphere, further contributing to global warming.

The Associated Press reported that 314 wildfires remained active over more than 2,265 square miles as of Monday. No new evacuations occurred this past weekend, however residents in some small communities left in voluntary evacuations last week, including elders, children and those that were medically vulnerable.
Most of the fires in June 2004 were located in Alaska's interior, while this June they have been scattered throughout the state, Alaska DNR said. They added that it was unusual to have this concentration of fire starts.
Lightning strikes were a major contributor to the ignition of wildfires in both June 2015 and June 2004. However, Alaska DNR says that June 2015 has had much more lightning than June 2004. In a span of three days from June 21-23, 2015, about 50,000 lightning strikes were recorded across the state.

wildfires,,"One of the state’s worst wildfire seasons in history has scorched 5 million acres of tundra and forests across Alaska, and experts here fear climate change will cause even more devastating fires through a combination of lower snowpack, drying tundra and melting permafrost.
Like an insulating blanket, snow reduces fire risk by keeping trees and grasses cold and damp. If less snow accumulates, or worse, snow covers less of the state than normal, there will be nothing to stop the near-constant summer sun from drying out the tundra and the permafrost layer below it. Permafrost, which is mostly composed of organic material, burns easily once thawed and lightning strikes.
Anchorage, for example, had its least snowy winter on record, with just over two feet of snow, the National Weather Service reported.
“We’re looking at, potentially over time, more fires burning more area,” said Kent Slaughter, the manager of the federal Bureau of Land Management’s Alaska Fire Service.
From the U.S. Army’s Fort Wainwright, Slaughter commands an army of firefighters, smokejumpers, logistics experts, pilots and supply clerks to coordinate battles most residents of the Lower 48 don't know are even happening. At the height of the fire season in early July, Slaughter and his teams were battling two wildfires that were each nearly three times bigger than any blaze in the rest of the country.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wildfires,,"More and more of Alaska’s boreal forests are burning each year, according to a study released last week. Researchers found that the acreage of forest burned in interior Alaska has climbed almost five-fold since 1943. That increase is likely influenced by a regional shift to a warmer, drier climate, as well as by human disturbances like encroaching development and fire suppression. Researchers found that that increase was most pronounced in the region’s most populated area, where firefighting efforts are most intense.
Thanks to its size and the remoteness of much of the state, Alaska has had to take a highly targeted approach to fighting wildfires. In the 1980s, the state established four zones of fire response, depending on whether the events happen near human settlement, whether there are valuable natural resources in the area and how likely the fire is to spread. The state’s population hubs, like Anchorage and Fairbanks, are designated as “critical” zones and receive the most protection — which often means fire suppression.
In a concerning twist, the study’s authors found the steepest increase in area burned has been in the highest tiers of protection. Fairbanks, the most populated area they looked at, was the most glaring example: on average, 12.4 percent more acreage burns there each year than the previous one.  
The reasons for that increase are likely complicated and include the region’s logging history. In Fairbanks, in particular, the landscape was basically denuded in the 1900s, thanks to the gold rush. Miners cut down the region’s forests to build homes and mining infrastructure and to burn to heat the frozen soil for digging. In the 100 years since, the forests have grown back and slowly gone through their natural succession, from the relatively fireproof willows and birches to the flammable black spruce.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wildfires,,"More than 640 fires have burned more than 3.2 million acres in Alaska this year, putting the state on pace for a record wildfire year. In 2004, Alaska’s worst fire season, about 6.6 million acres burned. More acres burned in the state last month than in June 2004.
The National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC), which makes predictions of the fire season for the federal government, expects the burning to continue. Wrote the agency:
“Alaska is in the heart of its fire season, and fire season could continue to be quite busy for another two months.”
The NIFC expects warmer temperatures and drier than normal conditions in the state.
Nearly one-third of all firefighters on active fires are in Alaska, according to the NIFC. More than 85 percent of acres burning are in Alaska.
According to a report from Climate Central, more fire is part of a trend: The fire season in Alaska is getting longer, the area burned is increasing and the number of large wildfires in the Arctic part of the state is growing.
Climate Central projects that the area burned in Alaska wildfires will double by mid-century.
More fires in the Arctic region are concerning to scientists because they could melt permafrost and release carbon that could accelerate global warming, said Todd Sanford, lead author of the study.
That’s because studies show wildfire can thaw permafrost beneath vegetation and soil and release sealed carbon, which could accelerate climate change though the effect is not certain.
Scientists are concerned that could create a feedback loop: More carbon in the atmosphere leading to warming temperatures, which thaws permafrost and leads to more carbon in the atmosphere.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

“There’s lots of vegetation,” Fish and Wildlife Service fire ecologist Lisa Saperstein said. “And where you have vegetation, it’s fuel.”
Tundra fires are sometimes allowed to burn out on their own if they don’t threaten infrastructure.

At the same time, the wildfire season is growing longer than it was a few decades back, by as much as seven weeks in some areas. Earlier snowmelt in the West is contributing to this trend.
So why is the fire season this year worse than usual? The answer can be summed up with two words: It’s hot and dry.
And today, California, our most populous state, is the epicenter of the severe heat and crippling drought that are fueling the wildfires _ conditions scientists are increasingly linking to climate change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

wildfires,Fire within CZU Lightning Complex burns 7 acres,"In Big Basin State Park south of San Francisco — may be a holdover from the fire 9 months ago
On Monday firefighters suppressed a fire that burned within the perimeter of the CZU Lightning Complex of fires. The blaze was in Big Basin Redwoods State Park south of San Francisco and could be a holdover from the 86,502-acre blaze from August, 2020.
When firefighters hiked into the fire it was less than two acres, but with the assistance of aircraft they stopped the spread after it burned about seven acres.
In January several other holdover fires were found in the footprint of the same fire.
There is a chance that considering the numerous very large fires that spread through California and Oregon last year, and with lower than normal precipitation during the winter, other similar holdover fires will be discovered. In many cases since they are within the burn perimeter, they may not be a serious problem. But if they are in a large unburned island, burning embers lofted into the air could ignite spot fires some distance away, perhaps outside the perimeter where there is an abundance of available fuel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015
drought,,"California is at the edge of another protracted drought, just a few years after one of the worst dry spells in state history left poor and rural communities without well water, triggered major water restrictions in cities, forced farmers to idle their fields, killed millions of trees, and fueled devastating megafires.
On Thursday, the unofficial end of California’s wet season, officials announced that the accumulation of snow in the Sierra Nevada mountains and the Cascades was about 40% below average levels. The state doesn’t have enough snow and rain banked to replenish its groundwater supplies, feed its rivers and streams or fill depleted reservoirs.
“It’s not just that we’re anticipating a dry year, it’s that this is our second extremely dry year, in a row,” said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California Los Angeles and the Nature Conservancy. California _ along with much of the US west _ is parched, Swain added, and should brace for water cuts and arid conditions that could trigger more destructive wildfires.
Just four years since the state’s last drought emergency, experts and advocates say the state isn’t ready to cope with what could be months and possibly years of drought to come.

Poor rainfall has led to the country’s most severe drought in a decade and left the megacity of 17 million people with critically low levels of water, according to Turkey’s chamber of chemical engineers. The Ankara mayor, Mansur Yava?, said earlier this month the capital had another 110 days’ worth in dams and reservoirs.
?zmir and Bursa, Turkey’s next two biggest cities, are also struggling, with dams that are about 36% and 24% full respectively, and farmers in wheat-producing areas such as the Konya plain and Edirne province on the border with Greece and Bulgaria are warning of crop failure.
The acute lack of rainfall in the second half of 2020 _ approaching 50% year on year for November _ led the religious affairs directorate to instruct imams and their congregations to pray for rain last month.
Turkey is a “water stressed” country, with just 1,346 cubic metres of water per capita per year, and has faced several droughts since the 1980s due to a combination of population growth, industrialisation, urban sprawl and climate change.
“Instead of focusing on measures to keep water demand under control, Turkey insists on expanding its water supply through building more dams  Turkey has built hundreds of dams in the last two decades,” said Dr Akgün ?lhan, a water management expert at the Istanbul Policy Center.

drought,,"A megadrought worse than any in “known prehistory” may already be underway in the western United States and northern Mexico, researchers have suggested.
After experiencing a wetter-than-average 20th century, the region has been suffering an ever-lengthening string of dry years starting in 2000, and scientists have now warned the worsening climate crisis is partly responsible for pushing the region towards extreme long-term drought.
The study is based on modern weather observations, along with 1,200 years of tree-ring data and dozens of climate models.
“Earlier studies were largely model projections of the future,” said lead author Park Williams, a bioclimatologist at Columbia University‘s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.
“We’re no longer looking at projections, but at where we are now. We now have enough observations of current drought and tree-ring records of past drought to say that we’re on the same trajectory as the worst prehistoric droughts.”
Reliable modern observations date only to about 1900, but tree rings have allowed scientists to infer yearly soil moisture for centuries before humans began influencing the climate.
The study has rung alarm bells, as previous research has linked the catastrophic ancient droughts recorded in tree rings to concurrent upheavals among indigenous medieval-era civilisations in the southwest US.
The new study is the most up-to-date and comprehensive long-term analysis, the researchers have said. It covers an area stretching across nine US states from Oregon and Montana down through California and New Mexico, and part of northern Mexico.
Using rings from thousands of trees, the researchers charted dozens of droughts across the region, starting in 800 AD.
Four stand out as so-called megadroughts, with extreme aridity lasting decades: the late 800s, mid-1100s, the 1200s, and the late 1500s. After 1600, there were other droughts, but none on such a large scale.
The team then compared the ancient megadroughts to soil moisture records calculated from observed weather in the years from 2000 to 2018.
They found the current drought is already outdoing the three earliest ones. The fourth, which spanned 1575 to 1603, may have been the worst of all — but the difference is slight enough to be within the range of uncertainty.
Furthermore, the current drought is affecting wider areas more consistently than any of the earlier ones — this is the “fingerprint” of climate change and associated temperatures, the researchers said.
All of the ancient droughts lasted longer than 19 years — the one that started in the 1200s ran for nearly a century — but all began by following a similar path to what is happening now, they said.
The ancient droughts weren’t driven by manmade climate change, and nature is still playing a strong role today.
A study last year led by Nathan Steiger at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University showed among other things, that unusually cool periodic conditions over the tropical Pacific Ocean (commonly called La Ni?a) during the previous megadroughts pushed storm tracks further north, and starved the region of precipitation.",https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/megadrought-us-mexico-climate-change-global-warming-study-a9470516.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"A severe drought is threatening South Africa's wildlife industry, with game farmers keeping fewer animals and tourists visiting game lodges in smaller numbers.
Parts of the country have been affected by consecutive years of abnormally hot weather and below average rainfall that have scorched grazing lands and dried up watering holes since 2015, the driest year on record.
Industry body Wildlife Ranching South Africa (WRSA) estimates the Northern Cape province has lost more than two-thirds of its game over the last three years.
It is conducting a countrywide survey to determine the scale of animal losses and the financial impact on the country's more than 9,000 wildlife ranches.
“It's been an extraordinary drought,” said WRSA chief Adri Kitshoff-Botha. “It's not a one-year or two-year drought. In some areas we've seen it has been going now for six years.”
The wildlife industry generates revenue for South Africa through tourism, hunting, breeding and meat production.
Trophy hunting alone generated 2bn rand (£106m) in 2016, according to research carried out for the environment ministry.
Southern Africa's temperatures are rising at twice the global average rate, according to the International Panel on Climate Change, and in much of South Africa the level of water in reservoirs is dwindling.
For Burger Schoeman, manager at Northern Cape game farm Thuru Lodge, the withered vegetation and parched ground are a serious concern for the sector.
Once home to around 4,500 wild animals _ including 35 different species, from antelope to rhino _ the lodge has lost around 1,000 animals due to drought. Carcasses are piling up in abandoned mines on the edge of the property.
“At this stage we are quite stretched.

Since October, the giant creatures have been found in Hwange National Park, although other parks have also been affected by the drought.?
Other species including giraffes, buffalos and impalas are also dying and the situation will only improve once rain returns, said Tinashe Farawo, a spokesperson for Zimbabwe National Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (Zimparks).
“Almost every animal is being affected,” he said. “Of course, elephants are easily noticed during patrols or game drives, but some bird species are seriously affected because they can only breed in certain tree heights and those trees are being knocked down by elephants.”
Many animals are straying from Zimbabwe’s parks into nearby communities in search of food and water.
Zimparks said 33 people have died from conflict with animals this year.
The drought has also taken its toll on crops, leaving more than half of the population in need of food aid.
The agency said it plans to move 600 elephants, two prides of lions and other animals from the Save Valley Conservancy in the south east of the country to less congested parks.

The rivers of Iraq, above all the Tigris and Euphrates, are drying up. The country is becoming more arid, and desertification is eating into the limited amount of agricultural land.
Dams built upriver in Turkey, Syria and Iran since the 1970s have reduced the flow of water that reaches Iraq by as much as half and the situation is about to get worse.
“On 1 July, Turkey will start filling the Ilisu dam on the Tigris and this will cause another decline in the inflows to our country of about 50 per cent,” Hassan Janabi, minister of water resources, told The Independent.
He says that Iraq used to get 30 billion cubic metres of water a year from the Euphrates, but now “we are happy if we get 16 billion cubic metres”.

drought,,"Hundreds of millions of people could be left without access to water as climate breakdown causes Asia’s vast glaciers to shrink, researchers have found.
When the rains fail, glaciers in the high-mountain regions around the Himalayas are a life-saver, releasing 36 cubic kilometres of water _ the equivalent of 14 million Olympic swimming pools _ to drought-prone areas every summer.
Glacial loss in the region has been going on for a few decades. However, the rate has increased _ between 2000 and 2016, glaciers were shrinking 1.6 times faster than the period between 1951 to 2007.
“A lot of the climate projections suggest the melt will continue to accelerate,” lead researcher Dr Hamish Pritchard, a glaciologist from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), told The Independent.
Using climate projections, Dr Pritchard believes the glacier melt will start to slow in around 2050.
He added: “As we start to get drought stress hitting, there will be crop failures and a loss of livestock. It could cause people to migrate and if you can’t migrate, it might cause conflict as people will need to fight with their neighbours for food.”
This will hit areas such as the fertile Indus Valley, which has been inhabited by human civilisations for many thousands of years and today feeds 237 million people.

Prefectural decrees limiting the use of water have been issued in 73 of the country's 101 départements with 20 already experiencing crisis situations.

On 1 June 2018, results showed 4.5%. One month later, it was 10.8%; almost four months later, on 20 October, about 35.9% of Europe’s rivers were flowing abnormally low, the lowest since at least 1991. A summer of little to no rain left major water systems without their much needed water; repeated heat waves were also speeding up evaporation, leading to more water loss. This year, drought was already underway in April, in a big part of Central Europe, ranging from moderate to extreme, according to data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) and in many regions the drought has continued throughout June, making 2020 the third year in a row with unexpectedly dry conditions, according to the Copernicus Emergency Management service.
In the future, this might not be such an uncommon event. Halfway through this century, droughts are predicted to become more frequent, threatening a wide range of sectors, from water and energy supply to river transport and agriculture. “The Mediterranean sub-region, already suffering most from water scarcity, is projected to experience the strongest negative effects of climate change on drought conditions,” the Joint Research Center (JRC) Droughts Team told Euronews. “With increasing global warming, streamflow deficits in this region are expected to happen more frequently, become more severe and last longer,” the JRC team said. If global temperatures rise by 3 degrees, the researchers say an additional 11 million people and 4.5 million hectares could be annually exposed to droughts that used to occur only once every 10 years or so. “We see a strong divide within Europe, with more drought in the South and less in the North,” says Dr. Niko Wanders, hydrological extremes researcher at Utrecht University. “We’re observing that extreme droughts are likely to become more severe. This is caused by a combination of higher temperatures and more evaporation that results in bigger water losses,” says Dr. Wanders.
A noticeable factor comes from the fact that rivers are also receiving less water from glaciers, according to experts at the University of Birmingham. Warming in the European Alps in the last three decades, combined with less snowfall has resulted in a little bit under a 54% loss in glacier ice area since 1850; long-term predictions show further drastic reductions.
Rivers affected by drought lose more than water depth. Less rainwater means that river waters cannot dilute pollutants efficiently; this leads to higher concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as of heavy metals and microplastics, according to experts from the MaRIUS research consortium. The organic build up boosts algal production, leading to blooms that could make the water unusable for human use.

There’s “an implicit assumption that no matter how big a disturbance is, the water will always come back — it’s just a matter of how long it takes,” says Tim Peterson, a hydrologist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. “I’ve never been satisfied with that.”
The years-long drought in southeastern Australia, which began sometime between 1997 and 2001 and lasted until 2010, offered a natural experiment to test this assumption, he says. “It wasn’t the most severe drought” the region has ever experienced, but it was the longest period of low rainfall in the region since about 1900.

Now the focus of concerns turns to the south, where rainfall has been below average for almost two years.”
Scientist Ant?nio Donato Nobre, author of the report “The Future Climate of Amazonia,” is emphatic: “South America is drying up as a result of the combined effects of deforestation and climate change.”
Low precipitation has an immediate impact on agriculture. The next affected are water supply and power generation. Water levels in the reservoirs of several dams have been low, including Itaipu, the world’s second-largest hydroelectric power plant. “The water that comes from the rivers to the reservoir is below the minimum level recorded in 1993. It’s a critical situation,” Cuartas says. “The Itaipu basin is used not only for power generation, but also for water supply.”
Recent rains in the south may bring temporary relief to agriculture, but water conditions take time to return to normal. “Rainfall would have to be at average levels or above for several months for the water system to start recovering and resume expected levels,” Cuartas says.
Agribusiness has been suffering losses as a result of drought, but it also contributes to the changes in the water regime. Deforesting the Amazon to establish cattle ranches, plantations and logging reduces precipitation in Brazil and other Latin American countries. With deforestation increasing, agribusiness and power generation may collapse in Brazil.
The Amazon Forest works as a cooling system. On a single day, a robust tree with its 20-meter (66-foot) canopy pumps around 1,100 liters (290 gallons) of water into the atmosphere. These masses of air carrying vapor from the forest’s transpiration are called “flying rivers.” They take humidity from the Amazon Basin to Brazil’s center-west, southeast and south regions as well as to neighboring countries. With fewer trees in the forest, there is less humidity in the air. And that leads to drought.",https://news.mongabay.com/2020/08/deforestation-in-the-amazon-is-drying-up-the-rest-of-brazil-report/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"A severe drought in the Czech Republic, which has reached historic levels in its fifth year, is worrying growers as it increasingly hits agriculture.
Scientists say the current series of drought, which began in 2015, is the worst in 500 years.
The temperature spikes have hit hardest in the eastern regions of Moravia and Silesia and the dry spell has forced many farmers to adapt fast. Some have had to cut fruit and wine grape production by 40 per cent.
In Central Bohemia — also hit hard — one grower, Lubo? Hrabánek of Farma Zadní Kopanina, says he has restructured his land to deal with the conditions.
He’s using smaller tracts for growing than the traditional multi-hectare square sectors that date from the communist days.
Hrabánek runs a family farm in the Bohemian Karst area whose main activity is animal production and breeding cattle, pigs and chickens. His four 10-hectare tracts also produce alfalfa, cereals and sometimes corn feed for his animals.
Despite recent rains, which have helped somewhat, Hrabánek has been “strongly impacted by the drought”, he said.
“Long-term care and care of the soil is important. Maybe that's why we focus anxiously on the principle of regular crop rotation.”
Besides using ancestral methods, he said “we try to grow crops that are not very demanding on water. We have not yet had to resort to artificial irrigation”.
The farm’s strategy has allowed it to avoid produce price hikes so far. “Our goal is not to spew production at all costs,” says Hrabánek, adding that his operation tries to tailor production to local needs.
Another farmer in the region — who produces artisanal honey, beets and greens that he markets directly in Prague — says water scarcity has forced him to irrigate year-round.
“We’re one of the only farms in our area still growing vegetables,” he said, noting that pumping from wells gets harder every year. Tensions are growing with neighbouring farms as the water table falls, he added.
Makers of craft beer in the Czech Republic _ a product increasingly in demand at home and abroad _ say they’ve been watching the prices and availability of hops, the country’s most famous export.
A representative of Chroust craft beer says the company buys Bohemian hops for its prime lagers and has not yet seen prices rising but acknowledges “growers are being hit. It could happen at any time”.
Winter wheat is at risk, say many farmers, but corn, with deeper roots, has fared batter. Meanwhile, other crops are likely to be ploughed under, unless more rain arrives soon.
The drought has also harmed grass and alfalfa production, needed for cattle feed, notes Robert Ku?era of the Agrarian Chamber of Ostrava.
An agency set up to study the drought and provide data, Intersucho.cz, reports that the Moravian-Silesian Region is in “one of the worst situations” with extreme drought at levels not seen for the last 50 years.
Authorities are supplying some towns with water tanks this year as they did in 2019, as other add-on effects include the spread of bark beetles and Moravian winemakers planning for a future shift from white wine production to red grapes, which are less dependent on water.
As for the effects on consumers, it’s clear that grocery prices are up but less certain is what role the drought has played, said Patrik Rozumbersky of market analyst company UniCredit. Rising food prices have more likely been driven by effects of the coronavirus, which held up shipments of produce at the country’s borders. A shortage of agriculture workers, who were blocked from travelling to the country from the east, is also a likely culprit, according to Rozumbersky.
Grocery chains Billa and Albert declined to comment on price changes but Prague consumers did appear to bulk up on packaged goods, which may also have had an effect _ though the Czech Republic did not see binge buying at the level witnessed in the UK and US during the COVID-19 lockdowns.
Consumer food price rises were also in line with current inflation reports showing a rate of 7.8 per cent, a rise from last year’s 6.4 per cent rate, according to Rozumbersky.
Czech crop prices, he adds, depend not just on local production levels but on “the quality of harvest in the whole European continent as the price of individual products is formed on the international market”.
At the same time, said Rozumbersky, “I think that the possible effect of drought might become more intensive later in the year as soon as the impact on the harvest is clearer.”
Industry organisations have been cautioning farmers too: the Czech Agricultural Chamber calls groundwater levels “strongly below normal overall,” noting that 71 per cent of wells are at unusually low water depths.
In addition, low water levels have hit key watersheds in the upper Oh?e, Lu?ická Nisa and Smědá river basins, which the chamber calls “strongly below normal.” Also drying up are natural springs, of which 79 per cent are suffering from “with severe or extreme drought”.",https://www.euronews.com/2020/05/05/historic-czech-drought-worries-growers-and-scientists,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"The water crisis along the California-Oregon border went from dire to catastrophic this week as federal regulators shut off irrigation water to farmers from a critical reservoir and said they would not send extra water to dying salmon downstream or to a half-dozen wildlife refuges that harbor millions of migrating birds each year.
In what is shaping up to be the worst water crisis in generations, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation said it will not release water this season into the main canal that feeds the bulk of the massive Klamath Reclamation Project, marking a first for the 114-year-old irrigation system. The agency announced last month that hundreds of irrigators would get dramatically less water than usual, but a worsening drought picture means water will be completely shut off instead.
The entire region is in extreme or exceptional drought, according to federal monitoring reports, and Oregon’s Klamath County is experiencing its driest year in 127 years.
“This year’s drought conditions are bringing unprecedented hardship to the communities of the Klamath Basin,” said Reclamation Deputy Commissioner Camille Calimlim Touton, calling the decision one of “historic consequence.” “Reclamation is dedicated to working with our water users, tribes and partners to get through this difficult year and developing long-term solutions for the basin.”
The canal, a major component of the federally operated Klamath Reclamation Project, funnels Klamath River water from the Upper Klamath Lake just north of the Oregon-California border to more than 130,000 acres (52,600 hectares), where generations of ranchers and farmers have grown hay, alfalfa and potatoes and grazed cattle.
Only one irrigation district within the 200,000-acre (80,940-hectare) project will receive any water from the Klamath River system this growing season, and it will have a severely limited supply, the Klamath Water Users Association said in a statement. Some other farmers rely on water from a different river, and they will also have a limited supply.
“This just couldn’t be worse,” said Klamath Irrigation District president Ty Kliewer. “The impacts to our family farms and these rural communities will be off the scale.”
At the same time, the agency said it would not release any so-called “flushing flows” from the same dam on the Upper Klamath Lake to bolster water levels downstream in the lower Klamath River. The river is key to the survival of coho salmon, which are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. In better water years the pulses of water help keep the river cool and turbulent — conditions that help the fragile species.

drought,,"Ongoing drought in Idaho will drastically shorten this year’s irrigation season for some farmers, officials said.
Farmers in south-central Idaho’s Wood River basin will face some of the biggest shortages, with an estimated 40 to 45 days before water from the Magic Reservoir runs out, according to David Stephenson, manager of Big Wood Canal Co. In a normal season, farmers might get water into late September.
Magic Reservoir, which supplies water to 36,000 acres of farmland, was only about a quarter full this year before dams were released last week, kicking off the season.
The reservoir holds water that flows through Big Wood River from melted snowfall in the mountains. The river is flowing at about 16% of its normal rate this year after record-low winter precipitation levels, Boise State Public Radio reported.
Prior to the winter, a dry summer and fall last year meant groundwater was already depleted as irrigators south of Bellevue pumped out of the aquifer, searching for any leftover moisture.
Carl Pendleton, a farmer who gets all of his water from Magic Reservoir, said the outlook is dismal.
“I sold my cow herd last week, the first time I’ve been out of livestock in my lifetime,” he said. “That’s the decisions we’re making based on this amount of water.”
The Idaho Department of Water Resources this spring could decide to curtail groundwater pumping to the north, which Pendleton said goes unchecked and exacerbates the shortages so that there isn’t enough to go around.

One of the longest rivers in North America, the Rio Grande delivers drinking water and irrigation supplies to millions of people from southern Colorado into Texas and Mexico under a decades-old water-sharing agreement. With more dry years than wet ones over the last two decades, how much water ends up flowing downstream has been a point of contention among the states.
As New Mexico and Texas battle over their shares before the U.S. Supreme Court, forecasters with the federal government’s Natural Resources Conservation Service say river and stream flows across New Mexico have dropped noticeably following a somewhat dry March.

drought,,"A two-decade-long dry spell that has parched much of the western United States is turning into one of the deepest megadroughts in the region in more than 1,200 years, a new study found.
And about half of this historic drought can be blamed on man-made global warming, according to a study in Thursday’s journal Science.
Scientists looked at a nine-state area from Oregon and Wyoming down through California and New Mexico, plus a sliver of southwestern Montana and parts of northern Mexico. They used thousands of tree rings to compare a drought that started in 2000 and is still going — despite a wet 2019 — to four past megadroughts since the year 800.
With soil moisture as the key measurement, they found only one other drought that was as big and was likely slightly bigger. That one started in 1575, just 10 years after St. Augustine, the first European city in the United States, was founded, and that drought ended before the Pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock in 1620.
What’s happening now is “a drought bigger than what modern society has seen,” said study lead author A. Park Williams, a bioclimatologist at Columbia University.
Daniel Swain, a UCLA climate scientist who wasn’t part of the study, called the research important because it provides evidence “that human-caused climate change transformed what might have otherwise been a moderate long-term drought into a severe event comparable to the ‘megadroughts’ of centuries past.”",https://apnews.com/article/ut-state-wire-az-state-wire-id-state-wire-or-state-wire-nv-state-wire-d1f130f8826ef57c74db611e959937ac,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"Arizona is getting a jump start on what will be a yearslong process to address a dwindling but key water source in the U.S. West.
Several states and Mexico rely on the Colorado River for drinking water and growing crops. But climate change, drought and demand have taken a toll on the river that no longer can deliver what was promised in the 1920s.
Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, California, Utah, Wyoming and Nevada have been operating under a set of guidelines approved in 2007. Those guidelines and an overlapping drought contingency plan will expire in 2026.
Arizona water officials gathered Thursday to outline a plan for what comes next. Other states in the river basin have had more informal discussions.
“Hold on to your seats because the reconsultation will be technical and complicated, and it will take a long time,” said Ted Cooke, general manager of the Central Arizona Project, who is co-chairing Arizona’s effort.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation is reviewing the effectiveness of the 2007 guidelines that address shortages and surpluses of water, and efforts to conserve water in Lake Mead along the Nevada-Arizona border. A draft is expected in August, and a final report in December.
“It’s prudent water management to review how well something has worked before determining what might replace it,” said Carly Jerla of the Bureau of Reclamation.
When those guidelines went into effect, the river had been in drought conditions for several years. It hasn’t let up. A drought contingency plan approved by the Western states last year was meant as a stop-gap. It requires Arizona, Nevada and Mexico to prop up Lake Mead earlier than under the 2007 guidelines. It also looped in California for water cuts.
A Reclamation audit published last month found that water use in the Colorado River’s lower basin dropped by more than 575,000 acre-feet from 2018 to 2019, a level not seen since 1986. That allowed Lake Mead and Lake Powell — key indicators of the river’s health — to increase by several feet but both remain well below capacity.
As of this week, Mead was 41% full. Powell, along the Arizona-Utah line, was 53% full.
Arizona is looking to build upon the work done on the drought contingency plan. The committee of about three dozen people that worked it helps develop what might replace the existing guidelines, focusing on how to sustain the river while meeting the state’s water needs, officials said.",https://apnews.com/article/nv-state-wire-droughts-ut-state-wire-az-state-wire-ca-state-wire-2476176178f44b71aa92f5a4215405ba,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He has declared a state of emergency - the second in three years - over the situation, mobilising all government agencies to respond to the drought.
The lack of rain has already left 500,000 people - one in five Namibians - without access to enough food, the government says.
The sparsely-populated country has seen a succession of droughts since 2013.
The government had set aside 40m (30m) to buy food and water tanks, and to transport livestock to and from grazing areas.
Prime Minister Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila has appealed for international help.
""We... call on all Namibians and development partners to assist in any way possible, so that we provide to our people who are affected, as well as the livestock,"" she said in the national assembly.

In semi-arid Botswana, the farmers are reeling after the worst drought in a decade wiped out entire harvests and left the land littered with dead livestock.
Two thirds of the crops planted last season failed, while Ngamiland, a rich beef producing region, has recorded nearly 40,000 cattle deaths.
Rancher Casper Matsheka says there was no food or water, so his animals starved to death.

drought,,"The severe drought that struck California from 2011 to 2015 had an obvious impact on rivers, forests, and wildlife. Now, a new study shows it also had some surprising effects on the state’s notorious air pollution, adding new wrinkles to the state’s efforts to clear the skies.
Researchers have long known that plants can both help create and cleanse one dangerous air pollutant: ground-level ozone, which causes breathing problems and exacerbates lung damage. Plants can scrub ozone from the air by absorbing the pollutant through their stomata, or pores. But certain plants also emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that react with other atmospheric chemicals to create ozone.
Understanding how drought influences these two processes can be tricky. Dry conditions could cause ozone levels to rise, because plants shrink their stomata to prevent water loss, reducing their ability to remove pollution. But drought might also reduce ozone levels, because the stress could cause plants to produce fewer ozone-forming VOCs.
California’s lengthy drought, and the state’s extensive network of air pollution sensors, gave researchers a rare opportunity to see what happens in the real world. The team, led by atmospheric chemistry Ph.D. candidate Angelique Demetillo and environmental science professor Sally Pusede at the University of Virginia (UVA) in Charlottesville, examined more than a decade’s worth of satellite and sensor data that documented atmospheric conditions over Bakersfield and Fresno, two California cities that suffer from ozone pollution.
The drought’s impact on air quality changed over time, the researchers report this week in Environmental Science & Technology. Plants did remove less ozone, with absorption dropping by about 15% during the most severe years of the drought. But during the early years of the drought, trees and other plants were able to maintain their production of one key ozone-forming VOC, isoprene. The chemical helps plants like oak trees withstand heat stress, and it appears the trees draw on carbon stores to sustain isoprene production. “It’s like a person exercising; when you’ve burned through your recent consumption the body switches over and starts burning fat,” says Manuel Lerdau, an organismal ecologist at UVA and a co-author of the study.
After about 4 years of drought, however, the stress took its toll. In 2013, plant isoprene levels fell dramatically, by 65% in Bakersfield and 54% in Fresno. Overall, that meant up to a 20% dip in ozone pollution. And even after the drought ended, isoprene levels didn’t immediately rebound.
The plant VOC reduction might sound like good news for reducing California’s smog. But the complexity of atmospheric chemistry means droughts could actually complicate clean air efforts. That’s because, currently, regulations mostly focus on controlling nitrogen oxides (NOx) from sources like cars and factories, which react with VOCs to form ozone. When VOC levels are higher, those NOx controls help choke off smog-creating reactions. But reduce the VOCs, and NOx limits go from “being very effective to less effective,” Pusede says.
Such findings offer yet another complication for U.S. states and cities struggling to meet federal clean air standards, especially in drought-prone western states. Regulators have little ability to control VOC emissions from plants, notes Pusede, and “I don’t know if we’d want to even if we could.” But the study could help regulators do a better job of factoring drought into their air pollution models.
The work also “provides a road map for better quantifying these impacts in other places,” says atmospheric scientist Jessica Neu of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, who reviewed the paper. And because much of the needed data can now be collected by satellites, she says it opens the door to investigating “drought impacts on air quality globally.”",https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/04/drought-not-just-about-water-it-affects-air-pollution-too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"About 42% of India’s land area is facing drought, with 6% exceptionally dry--four times the spatial extent of drought last year, according to data for the week ending March 26, 2019, from the Drought Early Warning System (DEWS), a real-time drought monitoring platform.
Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Maharashtra, parts of the North-East, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Telangana are the worst hit. These states are home to 500 million people, almost 40% of the country’s population.
While the central government has not declared drought anywhere so far, the state governments of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Odisha and Rajasthan have declared many of their districts as drought-hit.
“Before monsoon, which is still far away, the next two or three months are going to be difficult in many of these regions,” Vimal Mishra, associate professor at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Gandhinagar, and the developer of DEWS, told IndiaSpend.
Failed monsoon rains are the primary reason for the current situation. The North-East monsoon, also known as ‘post-monsoon rainfall’ (October-December) that provides 10-20% of India’s rainfall, was deficient by 44% in 2018 from the long-term normal of 127.2 mm, as per data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD). This compounded the rainfall deficit in the South-West (SW) monsoon (June-September) that provides 80% of India’s rainfall, which fell short by 9.4% in 2018--close to the 10% deficit range when the IMD declares a drought.
India has experienced widespread drought every year since 2015, Mishra said, with the exception of 2017. As the El Nino--the unusual warming of the equatorial Pacific Ocean that makes Indian summers warmer and reduces rainfall--looms over the 2019 SW monsoon, pre-monsoon showers (March-May) this year have also been deficient. India has received 36% less rainfall than the long-term average between March 1 and March 28, 2019, as per IMD data. The southern peninsular region recorded the lowest, a deficit greater than 60%.
Lower rainfall has reduced water levels in reservoirs across the country. The amount of water available in the country’s 91 major reservoirs has gone down 32 percentage points over five months to March 22, 2019. In 31 reservoirs of southern states, water level has gone down by 36 percentage points over five months.
The drought could further worsen farm distress, exacerbate groundwater extraction, increase migration from rural to urban areas, and further inflame water conflicts between states and between farms, cities and industries.
Yet, the latest drought manual issued in 2016 by the central government makes the process of declaring drought long and difficult, experts say, with the result that drought may go officially unannounced. This means relief measures such as drinking water supply, subsidised diesel and electricity for irrigation, increased number of days of insured work under National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) are not taken. And elections may further delay government acknowledgement and action.

drought,,"Residents call this drought-stricken community a “forgotten town.”
The flat, dusty roads to Vosburg are surrounded by withered fields. The streams feeding the community of a few thousand people have gone dry. Signs warn drivers of wandering cattle and sheep but there are none in sight.
The months-long drought is affecting most of southern Africa. The United Nations estimates that more than 11 million people now face crisis levels of food insecurity in places like Zimbabwe and Mozambique, where two cyclones wiped out crops earlier this year.
Among the hardest hit areas is South Africa’s Northern Cape province, where many farmers are struggling to keep their families and animals alive while revenue falls and debt piles up.
Commercial sheep farmer Louis van der Merwe, 64, broke down as he described losing more than 400 sheep and 450 springboks in the past two years because of the worst drought he has seen in 45 years of farming.
Some animals died of hunger. Others were sent prematurely to the slaughterhouse to reduce the number to feed. With tears running down his face, Van der Merwe said he now relies on donations of animal feed so the rest can survive.
“If we didn’t have hope, we would not be here anymore,” he said. “We have to have hope and faith. There are a couple of times when we have felt it is not worth it.”
Two of his fellow farmers have killed themselves due to the stress, Van der Merwe said.
Northern Cape province will need over 28 million in drought relief over the next three months to assist 15,500 affected farms, according to farmers’organization Agri-SA.
So far, South Africa’s government has pledged 2 million.
The World Food Program says southern Africa has received normal rainfall in just one of the past five growing seasons, with small-scale farmers feeling it most.
Some like 55-year-old Gertruida Buffel, have resorted to sharing their own food with their animals.

drought,,"evere to extreme drought is expected to hit countries in the lower Mekong basin from now until January 2020, warns the Mekong River Commission. Thailand and Cambodia would be hardest hit compared to Lao PDR and Viet Nam.    
Preliminary analysis of MRC’s data has shown that the draught is caused by insufficient rainfall during the wet season with a delayed arrival and earlier departure of the monsoon rain and an El Nino event that has created an abnormally high temperature and high evapotranspiration. 
During a normal year, the monsoon rain usually starts in late May and ends in October. But this year, it began almost two weeks late and departed about three weeks earlier. 
“This year’s prolonged dry weather condition can possibly adversely impact agricultural and crop production. The issue of water shortages for consumption could also come into play as the drought persists,” said Dr. Lam Hung Son, the MRC Secretariat’s Head of Regional Flood and Drought Management Center, who led the analysis.  
Using a three-month timeframe, the analysis looked at both the probability and degree of drought and rainfall occurrences compared with historical data called the standardized precipitation index (SPI), and the degree of dryness of the top soil layer known as the combined drought index (CDI) in the four MRC Member States: Lao PDR, Cambodia, Thailand and VietNam.",https://www.mrcmekong.org/news-and-events/news/drought-continues-to-hit-mekong-countries-risking-stress-on-crop-production-water-shortage/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"Drought is a pretty complicated climate extreme to define. Most commonly, it is defined as a precipitation deficit - much less precipitation falls than what is typically expected for a given time period.
But drought can be observed in lots of ways: lack of snowpack, low flows in rivers and streams, dry soils, higher evaporative losses, low lake/reservoir levels, etc. Because the climate varies all the time, it’s a safe assumption to say that all areas experience drought similarly because all areas will see times when precipitation is (or the other water variables) less than average.
But drought is not equally distributed across the U.S. Just as there are climatologically wetter areas and drier areas across the country, the same could be said about the occurrence, frequency, and severity of drought.
So, some might be asking, ""where are the most 'drought-prone' areas?
Drought-Prone States
First, let's look at the states that experience drought most often, according to data from the U.S. Drought Monitor.
The Drought Monitor has been tracking drought conditions across the country since 2000.
Each week, the map is updated with the latest conditions ranging from none, to D0 (which is an “abnormally dry” category), to D1-D4 (which represents increasing severities of drought categories).
How the map is made is a big process that includes analysis of data that encompasses local/regional variability in all the water variables and adds a human component, like impacts.",https://www.drought.gov/news/how-drought-prone-your-state-look-top-states-and-counties-drought-over-last-two-decades,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"A potent combination of record-breaking heat and a lack of rain has led to the rapid development of drought across the southeastern United States and Tennessee and Ohio Valleys during September 2019. Coming off an extremely wet 2018 east of the Rockies, the fast onset of widespread extensive drought has been quite the climate whiplash for millions across the Southeast.  With warmer than average temperatures expected to continue and October being a generally dry month based on climatology, drought conditions are likely to continue and possibly expand and intensify over the next week.
The extent to which drought has overtaken the southeastern United States by the end of September would have been hard to explain to residents of the region just a month prior.  While a few localized areas in Georgia/Alabama were already mired in drought, the broader region extending into the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys was drought free. In fact, the twelve-month period (September 2018-August 2019) coming to an end was record wet. But then, while it continued to be hot, things turned incredibly dry.
The rapid onset and severity of the event qualified it as a “Flash drought.” Generally, droughts are caused by a lack of precipitation over an extended period of time. In contrast, a flash drought is preceded not just by a lack of rain, but also very high temperatures and/or lots of sunny days. Even if the dry period is not especially severe, the latter two can suck moisture from the ground quickly.
For operational purposes, NOAA National Weather Service’s Climate Prediction Center defines a flash drought as an event during which an area experiences degradation by two or more drought categories in a four week period, based on the U.S. Drought Monitor.",https://www.climate.gov/news-features/event-tracker/flash-drought-engulfs-us-southeast-september-2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"An estimated 45 million people are threatened with hunger by a severe drought strangling wide stretches of southern Africa.
Emergency food deliveries are planned for parts of South Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe and other countries hard hit by a combination of low rainfall and high temperatures.
“We are witnessing millions of already poor people facing extreme food insecurity and exhausting their reserves because of compounding climate shocks that hit already vulnerable communities hardest. They need help urgently,” said Nellie Nyang’wa, southern Africa director for the international aid agency, Oxfam.
“The scale of the drought devastation across southern Africa is staggering.”
Parts of Zimbabwe have had the lowest rainfall since 1981, contributing to making more than 5.5 million at risk of extreme food insecurity, Oxfam said in a report released Thursday.
Zambia’s rich maize-growing area has been hit hard and exports are now banned; 2.3 million people there are food-insecure, according to Oxfam and the Zambia Red Cross. The drought is also worsening food availability in Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, Madagascar and Namibia, Oxfam said.
Southern Africa has received normal rainfall in just one of the past five growing seasons, which particularly hits the small-scale farmers who depend on rain for their crops, the U.N. World Food Program said last week. The U.N. food agencies plan to distribute emergency food aid to 11 million people in the coming months.
Two cataclysmic cyclones hit Mozambique, Zimbabwe and other southern African countries early this year, wiping out crops of maize and other staple crops. Without normal rainfall, subsistence farmers are hard-pressed to recover from the destruction caused by the tropical storms.
“The successive mixture of drought and flooding has been catastrophic for many communities. In most of the affected areas there isn’t enough drinking water, which means that people and animals — both livestock and wildlife — are having to use the same water points,” said Kaitano Chungu, Secretary General of the Zambia Red Cross.
“This is unacceptable as it exposes people to diseases and creates a heightened risk of animal attacks.”
Some families in the worst-affected areas are surviving the food shortage by eating wild fruits and roots, Chungu said.
The drought has also affected the region’s wildlife. At least 105 elephants have died in Zimbabwe as a result of lack of water and vegetation, according to Zimbabwe’s National Parks.",https://www.africanews.com/2019/11/08/southern-africa-drought-threatens-estimated-45-million-people/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"A historic drought in Chennai, the sixth-largest city in India, is so severe that it’s now visible from space.
The city’s 4.6 million citizens are rationing every drop of water, restaurants are closing early and companies are scaling back their operations as Chennai tries to survive a heat wave with 99 per cent less water than it had at the same time last year. The state government is shipping in water on trucks, but those trucks can’t replace the now dried-up lakes that once fed the city.
Everyone is asking the same question: When will the monsoons start?
Satellite footage released earlier this month shows the city’s four reservoirs, including nearby Lake Puzhal, have severely shrunk since last June. The reservoirs have a capacity of 318.8 billion litres, but they are down to a collective 651 million litres, according to government data reported by the Hindustan Times. The reservoirs have been reduced to 0.2 per cent of their capacity, according to state government data.
The city typically relies on the heavy rainfall of monsoon season to replenish its water supply, which comes from four lakes and groundwater reservoirs in the region. The monsoons usually start in June but they’ve been delayed this year, leaving citizens with little water amid blistering temperatures that exceed 40 C each day.
The problem dates back to last year, when Chennai saw a major shortfall in its monthly rainfall. The city received 80 per cent less rain than average in December alone, according to India’s weather office.
Temperatures in Chennai typically peak in May and June, around the same time that rainfall starts picking up. February, March and April are typically drought season, while the heaviest monsoon rains come in October, November and December.
The city has struggled to meet its water needs for the last few years. A government think tank warned last year that Chennai is one of 21 Indian cities that could run out of groundwater by 2020.",https://globalnews.ca/news/5424366/chennai-india-drought-satellite/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"A recent JRC article warns that the extreme drought conditions that affected central and northern Europe's 2018 spring/summer growing season could become the norm within 25 years, and calls for innovative adaptation measures to deal with extremes.
The 2018 spring and summer months were marked by a unique combination of drought conditions in central and northern Europe, and unusually wet conditions in southern Europe.
For instance, Germany was affected by a 6-month drought which lasted the whole spring and summer, while the spring was particularly wet in the Iberian Peninsula.
Both extremes affected crop yields. The droughts resulted into total reductions in the main crop yields of up to 50%.
This was partially offset by southern Europe's yield gains of up to 34%.
This juxtaposition of opposite climate anomalies  _ droughts in the Northern part of Europe and unusually wet condition in the South, sometimes referred to as the ""water seesaw"" _ was  a unique phenomenon of the last 500 years.
 Future climate projections, based on high resolution global models, show that southern Europe is less likely to experience such favourably wet conditions for crop growth in the future.
On the other hand, droughts similar to those of 2018 could become common as early as 2043.",https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/news/european-droughts-2018-warning-things-come,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

drought,,"Alaska’s wettest region is experiencing an extreme drought for the first time in recorded history, climate scientists say.
The southernmost portion of Southeast Alaska, including Ketchikan, Prince of Wales Island, Wrangell and Metlakatla, has been in a drought for the last two years, said Rick Thoman, a climatologist at the Fairbanks-based Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy.
Last week, though, the drought was updated to a D3, or “extreme” drought, the second-highest category the U.S. Drought Monitor measures. It’s the first time those conditions have ever been recorded in Alaska, according to the Drought Monitor.
Meanwhile, areas experiencing lesser “severe” and “moderate” droughts on the Panhandle have expanded, the Drought Monitor said.
Droughts look different in the rainforest climate of Southeast Alaska than elsewhere in the world, though, with the key difference being that the region is still getting quite a lot of precipitation by most standards, Thoman said.
Ketchikan has averaged about 100 inches annually since 2017, and Metlakatla has seen between 80 and 90, climatologists say.
“In the mass amount of the world that would be an immense amount of rain,” Thoman said.
However, that’s still drastically less than what’s normal for the region. Ketchikan normally averages 150 inches of precipitation a year, and Metlakatla 118.

drought,,"On June 5, it drizzled for about ten minutes over most of Marathwada in India’s western state of Maharashtra. That made headlines in the local media, because it was the first time since August 17, 2018, that anyone had seen a drop of rain in this region, the epicentre of the drought that is now afflicting almost half of India.
Two days earlier, Sakharam Landge was ploughing his farm near Umarkheda village in Jalna district. It was 42 degrees Celsius in the shade, a hot wind was blowing away the topsoil his tractor churned up, and he was not sure he would be able to sow any crop this summer. “But what else can I do,” he said. “My grandfather, my father, all the elders in the village said we must plough our farms in the first half of June, so that we can sow our Kharif (summer) crop as soon as the rains arrive on June 15.”
A farmer in his early forties, Landge is perfectly aware that the monsoon rains have not been arriving on June 15 in recent years. Of the 18 summer monsoons this millennium in Marathwada _ a region where the overwhelming majority of farmers have no irrigation facilities _ ten have caused droughts and one a flood. As the monsoon winds bring rainfall from the Arabian Sea to India’s west coast, Marathwada is also in the rain shadow of the Western Ghats _ a mountain chain along the coast _ and has always been a low rainfall area.
However, it is also home to the famously productive ‘black cotton soil’ of the Deccan Plateau. In a good rainfall year, cotton and soybean _ the two staple crops of the region in recent decades _ bring enough money to see an average farming family through for the next couple of years as well.

Within this, ‘severe to exceptionally dry conditions’ prevailed in 17.33 per cent area, according to the real-time drought monitoring platform.
While just 0.65 per cent of area had ‘exceptionally dry’ conditions in June 2018, it has now jumped to 5.87 per cent, stated the latest data.
Further, the delay in southwest monsoons has worsened the drought index, the DEWS reported.
In the June 6 update, real-time platform recorded 43.02 per cent area under ‘abnormally to exceptionally dry’ conditions. However, the latest data showed an increase (44.17 per cent). 
Similarly, percentage of area under ‘extremely dry to exceptional dry’ increased from 10.83 to 11.22 per cent during the same period.
India has witnessed the second-driest pre-monsoon season in the last 65 years. The country received 99 millimeters (mm) rainfall between March and May — with 23 per cent below the normal rainfall during this time of the year —, showed the latest data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD).
The deficit is prevalent across the country with south India having a deficit of 47 per cent, followed by northwest India (30 per cent), central India (18 per cent), and east and northeast (14 per cent).
The month of June, which accounts for 18 per cent of rain, may end up with a deficit of 40 per cent in at least 66 districts across the country, warned Skymet Weather, a private weather forecasting agency.
The low rainfall would be difficult to make up for the deficit in coming months, it noted.
According to the IMD, there is also a possibility of weaker monsoon in July. It could be a great cause of worry, as the month is crucial and receives one third of the total monsoon rains in the country. 
The sluggish pace of the south west monsoon has compounded the severe dry spell. As a result, at least 30 sub-divisions are likely to experience ‘deficient’ and ‘largely deficient’ monsoon season, the IMD said.
Most of these are in Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, and the north eastern states. Only four sub-divisions in Karnataka, Gujarat, and Lakshadweep have witnessed ‘normal’ rainfall.
Low rainfall has also contributed to a downward trend in water levels in at least 71 of 91 reservoirs across India, a recent bulletin by the Central Water Commission (CWC), has showed.

Soaring temperatures since early June, averaging about 45 degrees, have stifled most of the country, while the progress of the annual monsoon rains, which normally bring relief from the searing heat and are a vital source of water, has been the slowest in 12 years.
An estimated 43 per cent of the country is affected by drought.
According to countrywide news reports, hundreds of villages and small towns in states including Uttar Pradesh in the east, Rajasthan and Maharashtra in the west and Andhra Pradesh in southern India are surrounded by parched farmland and have been deserted.
The country’s meteorological department predicts a deficient monsoon that in all likelihood may not be able to resuscitate some 91 life-sustaining reservoirs across India, where water levels in some cases are hovering at about 30 per cent capacity.
The federal government, however, has played down reports of water shortages. Addressing a press conference in New Delhi on Monday, water resources minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said media reports of the water crisis were exaggerated.",https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/asia-pacific/india-s-widespread-drought-affects-over-600-million-people-1.3931152,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"Some parts of the Horn of Africa have been hit by the worst drought in 60 years, the UN says.
More than 10 million people are thought to be affected across the region.
The UN now classifies large areas of Somalia, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Kenya as a crisis or an emergency.
Charity Save the Children says drought and war in Somalia has led to unprecedented numbers fleeing across the border into Kenya, with about 1,300 people arriving every day.
Three camps at Dadaab, just inside Kenya, are home to well over 350,000 people, but they were built to hold just 90,000 and are severely overcrowded.
A prolonged failure of rains, which began in late 2010, is now taking its toll.
The UN's Office for the Co-Ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) warns that the situation is continuing to deteriorate, and the number of people in need will continue to increase.
The numbers now affected are huge, Ohca says: 3.2m in Ethiopia, 3.2m in Kenya, 2.6m in Somalia and more than 100,000 in Djibouti.
Every month during 2011, about 15,000 Somalis have fled their country, arriving in Kenya and Ethiopia, according to Ocha.
While conflict has been a fact of life for them for years, it is the drought that has brought them to breaking point. Many have walked for days, are exhausted, in poor health, desperate for food and water.
The UN refugee agency is dealing with the exodus.
A new refugee camp primarily for Somalis was opened at Kobe in Ethiopia last Friday, near an existing camp at Melkadida.
More than 3,500 refugees and their belongings were moved there over the weekend.
The UNHCR says this is the sixth camp for Somalis in Ethiopia, which is currently housing some 130,000 displaced people.
Food prices have risen substantially across the region, pushing many moderately poor households over the edge.
The price of grain in affected areas in Kenya is 30-80% above average.
The spokeswoman for Ocha, Elizabeth Byrs, said appeals for Somalia and Kenya, each about 525m (328m), are barely 50% funded, while a 30m appeal for Djibouti has raised just 30% of the needed funds.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13944550,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"Millions of people in the Horn of Africa are facing severe shortages of food as the worst drought in the region for six decades withers crops and kills livestock, as the BBC's world affairs correspondent Mike Wooldridge reports.
""I had a herd of 200 cows. I took them to Ethiopia when the drought started. All the cows I had taken there died and I came back without a single cow.""
That story told by a resident of Wajir district in northern Kenya might not immediately appear to symbolise the humanitarian emergency increasingly gripping swathes of East Africa and the Horn of Africa - in the way that the rapidly growing number of acutely malnourished children trekking out of Somalia does.
But the distress being experienced by pastoralist communities across the affected region also goes a long way in explaining the severity of the current drought, its impact and the limits to the strategies people use to try to protect their livelihoods in such circumstances.
The Wajir cattle herder acted when he saw the grazing for his precious animals drying up.
But in the area of Ethiopia he took them to there turned out to be no greater chance of saving them. They started dropping dead, he says, one by one.
Aid officials estimate that up to half a million cattle have been lost in Ethiopia this year.
It often takes pastoralists at least two years to recover from a severe drought, particularly where it means building up a milking herd again.
This year's drought has hit hard when many people have not yet recovered from the last serious drought in 2009.
And the more marginalised the communities - and many of them are - the more likely people are to be pushed over the edge.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-14023160,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since last September, the province has had 60% less rainfall than normal. According to the Ministry of Civil Affairs, 8.1 million people — 18% of Yunnan's population — are short of drinking water, and US2.5-billion worth of crops are expected to fail.
Scientists in China say that the crisis marks one of the strongest case studies so far of how climate change and poor environmental practice can combine to create a disaster. They are now scrambling to pin down exactly what caused the drought, and whether similar events are likely to hit the region more often in the future.
Meanwhile, with most of the province's winter crops ruined, local farmers need immediate help. Zhu has been going from county to county to persuade farmers to grow different crops together in the same field, rather than as a monoculture. Intercropping can boost yields by up to 30%, and could help to avoid food shortages in the region later this year1. This summer, 80% of the farmland in Yunnan — a staggering 2.9 million hectares — will use the technique. But success will depend on a break in the weather.

In some areas these are the driest conditions in a lifetime. Snowfalls in recent days have helped a little, but still, across huge areas of land, water is in short supply.
The countryside is dotted with empty dams. Standing on top of one, near Qufu in Shandong Province, you can see just a tiny muddy pool in the centre of a dam that is hundreds of metres long.
Sitting rusting on the earth is a small boat. Along the dry dam floor people have been planting rows of crops because it has been like this for so long.
Li Si Jiao, 77, his back stooped with age, shuffles slowly along a path on top of the dam. His face is weathered and creased with lines. He gestures at the dam and says the water used to stretch all the way to the village in the distance, but no more.

Seven water companies in those areas are to impose hosepipe bans on 5 April.
Yorkshire Water said it did not anticipate any restrictions such as hosepipe bans for the time being.
In a statement, the company said it would constantly review the situation ""as the dry weather continues"".

As the warm spell across the UK continued on Tuesday, firefighters were involved in tackling blazes in North Yorkshire, south Wales, Dumfries and Galloway and the Borders.
The grassland fires in Scotland, which had broken out on Monday afternoon, took until Tuesday evening to extinguish.
Owing to clear conditions and its elevated position across a front of 1km-2km, the Dumfries blaze was visible as far away as Workington in Cumbria.
A Royal Navy helicopter from HMS Gannet at Prestwick was used to move firefighters and equipment across the remote hillside.
On Hanging Moor, in Thruscross, it took more than 35 firefighters almost 12 hours to bring a blaze under control, after being called to the scene early on Tuesday afternoon.
In south Wales on Tuesday, a grass fire spread to a house, garage and electricity poles near Pontardawe in the Swansea Valley, while forestry in the Rhondda Fach was also hit by a spreading grass fire.

drought,,"The number of people facing severe food shortages is set to increase as the impact of drought, along with high food and fuel prices, continues to grip the Horn of Africa region, FAO warned today.
High levels of acute malnutrition are widespread and more than 8 million people in Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia are in need of emergency assistance.
The region has now experienced two consecutive seasons of significantly below-average rainfall, resulting in failed crop production, depletion of grazing resources and significant livestock mortality.
Chronic crisis
""The current crisis is not an unusual or chance event, but rather a chronic feature of the region. The challenge ahead is to empower farmers and pastoralists to adapt to the new realities of high variability of weather patterns and more frequent extreme weather events,"" said Rod Charters, Regional Emergency Coordinator for Eastern and Central Africa.
""Together with our partners of the Regional Food Security and Nutrition Working Group we have been preparing for this drought scenario since the failure of last year's short rains. FAO issued various alerts and has been supporting countries' preparedness plans in the Region.""
In Somalia, malnutrition rates are amongst the worst in the world, with one in four children in southern Somalia acutely malnourished. The drought is affecting most parts of the country, leading to livestock deaths and sky-rocketing food prices which make it increasingly difficult for poor families to feed themselves.
Currently, 2.5 million people _ one in three Somalis _ are in need of humanitarian assistance but with the ongoing conflict in the South, coupled with the poor outlook for the upcoming harvest, many more Somalis may fall into severe crisis.
In Kenya, more than 2.4 million people in the pastoralist and agropastoralist areas of northern and northeastern regions are estimated to be unable to meet their basic food and water needs. The food security situation is expected to further deteriorate as milk production in the drought-affected areas has collapsed and will not recover until October when the short rains are expected to start.
Furthermore, distances to water have doubled to 30-40 kms in many areas and conflicts have occurred over grazing resources, leading to loss of human lives and livestock, along with constrained market access. Emergency interventions are urgently required to mitigate the impact and protect further livelihood and nutritional deterioration.
In Ethiopia, a La Ni?a episode has resulted in the failure of two consecutive seasons of rain, water shortages, very poor pasture and marked deterioration in livestock conditions resulting in much reduced livestock prices in south and southeastern lowlands. In Borena Zone, on the southern border with Kenya, 220 000 cattle deaths have been reported. 
Additionally, the drought has also affected the 2011 ""belg"" cropping season to be harvested in June/July, which is expected to be very poor in the Oromia, Tigray, Ahmara and SNNP (Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples) regions.
At the beginning of June the number of people requiring assistance in Ethiopia was estimated at 11.4 million.  This includes 3.2 million people in need of emergency assistance and the 8.2 million people registered under the productive safety net programme.
In Djibouti, the ongoing drought coupled with very high staple food prices, high unemployment and increased rural-urban migration has worsened the food security situation at the household level. Water shortages in Djibouti City are also expected to become a serious issue over the coming months as the peak demand for water approaches.",http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/80157/icode/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"The United Nations refugee agency said today that with the increasing gravity of the situation in Somalia, where hundreds of thousands of people are suffering because of drought and conflict, it was stepping up assistance with aid distributions across the country’s central and southern parts.
Adrian Edwards, a spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), told a news briefing in Geneva that “although access remains a serious impediment, working with partners on the ground in Somalia we have so far distributed assistance packages to some 90,000 people in Mogadishu and Belet Hawa and Dobley in southwest Somalia.”
The agency is handing out non-food aid for an estimated 126,000 people in other parts of the Gedo and Lower Juba region to the west, with assistance also on its way to Mogadishu and the Afgooye corridor just west of Mogadishu, as well as further southwest in the Lower Shabelle area, Mr. Edwards said.
The agency is strengthening its mechanisms for tracking population movement and protection monitoring in the corridors leading to the Dolo Ado and Dadaab refugee camps in Ethiopia and Kenya respectively.
“Our aim is that through shorter interval reporting we’ll be better able to inform emergency interventions,” Mr. Edwards said. “UNHCR is the primary provider of this information to UN agencies and NGOs operating in Somalia.”
“Given the very serious health state of many refugees arriving at camps in neighbouring countries, UNHCR believes it is of life-saving importance that people in Somalia are able to get help where they need it,” he said. “This may, in certain circumstances, mitigate the necessity to cross borders into neighbouring countries, where refugee camps were already bursting at the seams.”

drought,,"In some areas of Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia and Uganda, drought conditions are the worst in 60 years, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in an update.
Almost half the of children arriving in refugees camps in Ethiopia from southern Somalia are malnourished, while 11 districts in Kenya have reported malnutrition rates above the 15 per cent emergency threshold. Supplementary and therapeutic feeding programmes are struggling to keep pace with the rising needs, according to OCHA.
Drought-related displacement and refugee flows are on the rise, with an average of 15,000 Somalis arriving in Kenya and Ethiopia every month this year seeking assistance.
“While conflict has been a fact of life for them for years, it is the drought that has taken them to breaking point. Many have walked for days, are exhausted, in poor health, desperate for food and water, and arriving in a worse condition than usual,” according to the OCHA update on the drought situation in the region.
The influx of Somalis into refugee camps in the Dadaab area of Kenya’s North-Eastern province _ the largest refugee settlement in the world _ has led to worsening overcrowding amid limited resources.
The drought has forced children out of school as both human and livestock diseases spread. Competition for the meagre resources is causing tensions among communities.
The price of grain in drought-affected areas of Kenya is 30 to 80 per cent more than the five-year average, according to OCHA, while in Ethiopia, the consumer price index for food increased by almost 41 per cent last month. Further food price hikes area expected in Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda and Somalia, but could ease after the next harvests expected later this year.
OCHA called for the scaling up of the emergency response in all affected areas, urging governments, donors and relief agencies step up efforts to prevent further deterioration.
Further funding is also required to enable humanitarian agencies to provide the necessary assistance. UN agencies and the partners this year requested 529 million for Somalia, but only 50 per cent of that amount has been received.
In Kenya, where 525 million is required, about 54 per cent of that money has been obtained so far.

drought,,"Djibouti is one of the smallest countries on the African continent. Situated between Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia, the total population is approximately 820,000 people. These factors alone make it an easy country to overlook in the context of the current drought. Next to the emergency crises in Kenya and Somalia, the needs of the drought-affected population may seem insignificant. Yet this is not a sufficient reason to neglect Djiboutians who are asking for help.
The IFRC together with the Djibouti Red Crescent have been undergoing an assessment throughout the country, and the needs are quite real. In Garabtisan village, northern Djibouti, there are approximately 1500 people - including 300 children - who have been facing a drought for the past five years.
“There is no public school for our children”, explained Madina, a mother of nine children. “We used to have a Koranic school, but the last wind storm knocked down the tree where lessons took place. Now, there is no place for children to learn.” It is a symbolic loss for this community who are on the brink of an emergency crisis.
In Garabtisan village, women such as Madina have only 40 litres of water for a period of 2 to 3 days to support the needs of an entire family. The nearest water source requires that women walk the distance of 23km, or they wait for water delivery from the military stationed nearby. But with a community of 1500 people, it is simply impossible for the military to adequately service the needs of Garabtisan village without support. In addition to high food prices, geographical isolation and the depletion of livestock, their situation is increasingly desperate.
Access to health care is another critical problem for women and children in Garabtisan village. When a child falls ill, the community is unable to respond. Each month there are approximately 6 to 7 births, with a loss of 2 to 3 children. The mobile health clinic provided by the Ministry of Health faces significant logistical challenges to reach the community as needed.
Yet the people of Garabtisan have dignity. Their cultural traditions practice basic hygiene such as washing children’s hands before eating, or defecating away from the home. Madina clearly wants to be a good mother, and meet the basic needs of her children.
The Djibouti Red Crescent and IFRC recognise the clear needs in drought-affected areas such as Garabtisan village. The Government of Djibouti has claimed there are 120,000 in need of critical assistance in rural areas. This indicates that 1 out of 8 persons are in need of emergency aid.
However the response cannot be successful by one agency or government ministry alone. Joint action is needed in Djibouti, in order to meet the challenges of drought-affected communities. Although the figures may be comparatively small to the rest of the Horn of Africa, women and mothers in desperate need, such as Madina, should be enough to take action.",https://www.ifrc.org/ar/news-and-media/news-stories/africa/djibouti/drought-takes-hold-in-djibouti/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"The latest famine in Somalia has put a spotlight on the urgent need to develop national and regional drought policies, according to the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, which are jointly leading the international action to address the growing impact of droughts.
Drought is expected to continue in hard-hit southern Somalia during August and September, as well as parts of Ethiopia, Djibouti and Kenya, according to the latest WMO Climate Outlook Forum for the region, which provides regional climate forecasts. The IGAD Climate Prediction and Applications Centre (ICPAC) already called for preparedness for an ongoing long period of drought over parts of the equatorial region in its climate update for the Greater Horn of Africa on 15 January 2011.
Droughts have become more common over the past two decades. This is consistent with reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, stating that the world has become more drought-prone over the last 25 years, and will see an increased frequency of droughts in the future.
""Droughts do not happen overnight,"" said Luc Gnacadja, Executive Secretary of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), responding to the declaration of famine by the United Nations earlier this month. ""The UNCCD joins the calls on the international community to respond urgently to this crisis. At the same time, we stress the need for effective, long-term solutions to the root causes of famine in drought-prone regions, such as implementation of drought management systems and measures to stop desertification, which means land degradation in drylands.""
""We are moving forward quickly to provide integrated drought information to help decision-makers deal with drought, such as the one underway right now in East Africa,"" said Michel Jarraud, Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization. ""Drought is a serious and growing problem in many countries. Adaptation to drought, desertification and climate change urgently needs to be mainstreamed in national development policies.""
Mr Gnacadja visited Mr Jarraud at WMO earlier this month to discuss cooperation between the two organizations, following the UN declaration of famine for two provinces in southern Somalia on 13 July 2011.

Some 4.5 inches of rain earlier this month increased the flow of the Llano River, two forks of which meet at the town. But the water is still pretty low — and four panelists at the Texas Water Symposium last week brought some unwelcome news to the townspeople: It’s not going to get any better anytime soon.
“As the state climatologist, people ask me, ‘When’s it going to rain?’” said John Nielsen-Gammon, one of the panelists, who is a professor of meteorology at Texas A&M University and the state's climatologist.
The answer, according to Nielsen-Gammon, is “eventually,” but chances are the drought will last another year, possibly even another decade.
The weather, or lack thereof, can be attributed to La Nia, a cyclical weather pattern resulting in cooler waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Meteorologists say that although La Nia had faded by the summer, it has now returned and is strengthening.
In the past 12 months, Texas has seen 11.1 inches of rainfall on average, according to Nielsen-Gammon, and it broke a heat record for the country that was previously set during the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. Texas AgriLife Extension Service estimates the cost of the drought to be about 5.2 billion, and that estimate — already out of date because it was compiled two months ago — doesn’t include the impact to several kinds of crops and the forestry industry.

But the animals at a recent Emory auction look pitiful. They're standing in 107-degree heat — that's in the shade — with their ribs showing, stressed out. It's been like this for the past nine weeks — no rain. Although these cows were bred for the heat, they weren't bred for this. They look absolutely baked.

drought,,"The United Nations’ food agency issued an alert on Tuesday warning that a severe drought was threatening the wheat crop in China, the world’s largest wheat producer, and resulting in shortages of drinking water for people and livestock.
China has been essentially self-sufficient in grain for decades, for national security reasons. Any move by China to import large quantities of food in response to the drought could drive international prices even higher than the record levels recently reached.
“China’s grain situation is critical to the rest of the world ? if they are forced to go out on the market to procure adequate supplies for their population, it could send huge shock waves through the world’s grain markets,” said Robert S. Zeigler, the director general of the International Rice Research Institute in Los Ba?os, in the Philippines.
The state-run news media in China warned Monday that the country’s major agricultural regions were facing their worst drought in 60 years. On Tuesday the state news agency Xinhua said that Shandong Province, a cornerstone of Chinese grain production, was bracing for its worst drought in 200 years unless substantial precipitation came by the end of this month.
World wheat prices are already surging, and they have been widely cited as one reason for protests in Egypt and elsewhere in the Arab world. A separate United Nations report last week said global food export prices had reached record levels in January. The impact of China’s drought on global food prices and supplies could create serious problems for less affluent countries that rely on imported food.

drought,,"The drought and the massive displacement of people in the Horn of Africa, in addition to conflict and violence, high food prices, and dwindling resources, has resulted in one of the most dramatic global humanitarian crises.
According to the latest reports by the World Food Programme, some 10 million people are affected by the Horn of Africa's worst drought in 60 years.
Two consecutive rainy seasons have failed, producing a decline of more than 25% of rain for pastoral areas in Somalia, Northern and Eastern Kenya, Southern and Eastern Ethiopia and Djibouti. As a result harvests have failed, livestock mortality has soared, and food and water have become extremely expensive.
The price of food for essential cereals like maize has increased 2,5 times in Eastern Kenya, Eastern Ethiopia and Southern Somalia. Millions of people in the region cannot meet basic survival needs, and emergency levels of acute malnutrition are widespread.
In most areas affected by the drought, malnutrition is affecting over 30% of people, which is more than double the internationally recognized emergency threshold. Those who can are leaving their land and their homes to walk long distances trying to find food and water. Many Somalis are crossing borders to do that. An estimated 3,000 people a day are arriving in Kenya and Ethiopia from Somalia in search for a help.

Since then, there has been feverish speculation about why tourists were on an active volcano and why the eruption wasn’t predicted. Mount Ontake (also known as Ontakesan) is a stratovolcano which last erupted in 1979-80 and 2007 (there was also a possible, unconfirmed eruption in 1991). Before this, there were no recorded historical eruptions at Mount Ontake. Since the eruption in 1980, Ontake has been monitored by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). It has seismometers around the volcano to record volcanic tremors and instruments to measure any changes around the volcano. This would provide the JMA with signs that there was magma movement underneath the volcano and that perhaps an eruption was imminent. There had been a slight increase in volcanic tremors starting at the beginning of September. Why, then, was this eruption not predicted?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Zodiac Maritime, the London-based Israeli company that operates the tanker, said a British and a Romanian citizen had died in the attack late on Thursday.
The UK Ministry of Defence confirmed an incident involving a vessel had taken place in the area, but gave no further details.
An investigation is under way.
In a statement shared on social media on Friday, Zodiac Maritime announced the two deaths with ""profound sadness"". It said no other injuries had been reported.
The company, which belongs to Israeli shipping magnate Eyal Ofer, said it was working to establish what had happened.
It added that the vessel was now ""sailing under the control of her crew"" and heading to a safe location with a US naval escort.
The UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) naval authority said it was investigating the incident, which occurred near the Omani island of Masirah, and confirmed that ""coalition forces"" were assisting the vessel.

Hundreds gathered at a shopping mall on Monday to watch a broadcast and cheer on Hong Kong fencer Edgar Cheung, who won gold in the men's individual foil.

When the Chinese national anthem was played, some in the crowd began jeering while others shouted ""We are Hong Kong"", video filmed at the scene shows.

It is illegal to insult the anthem under a recently passed law.

Anyone found guilty of flouting the national anthem law could be jailed up to three years and fined HK$50,000 (£4,600, $6,400).

Reports also said that the British colonial flag was flown and some had chanted protest slogans, which could possibly violate the national security law which forbids anything that incites ""secession"" and could result in life in jail.

Police sources told local media that they are collecting and examining footage from the mall's security cameras.

The incident took place in the same week as the conviction of the first person charged under the national security law.

Both laws were passed last year and have been met with huge controversy, with critics saying they clamp down on free speech.

But Hong Kong authorities and the Chinese government deny this and say the laws are necessary to preserve peace and patriotism.

Hong Kong saw widespread protests in 2019 when tens of thousands took to the streets demanding democratic reforms. Some of those demonstrations turned violent as protesters and police clashed.

Since then China has cracked down hard, introducing several strict laws aimed at curbing violence and what it deems as ""separatism"".

Hong Kong, a former British colony, was handed back to China in 1997.

Since then it has been ruled under the ""one country, two systems"" principle that preserves freedoms in the city that the mainland does not have.

Critics say those freedoms are now under threat with China's recent moves and the UK has accused China of flouting the terms of its handover agreement, but China denies this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He said that ""on perhaps the most anticipated album of 2021, Eilish uses subdued yet powerful song writing to consider how fame has seeped into every corner of her life.

The interpreters are being resettled under a visa programme for those who worked with the US during the recently ended 20-year war with the Taliban.
They arrived in the early hours of Friday morning and were taken to Fort Lee military base in Virginia.
They are expected to stay there for around a week while they are processed.
In a statement, US President Joe Biden called the arrivals ""a milestone"" and ""the first of many"" as US authorities work to relocate eligible Afghans out of harm's way.
Afghans eligible for Special Immigrant Visas (SIV) will be transported either to the US, American facilities abroad or to third countries while they finish their applications. The most recent arrivals have already completed an extensive vetting process.
On Thursday, the US Senate approved more than $1bn (£719m) to pay for the evacuations, including housing and transportation.
The bill would also loosen applicant requirements and allow for 8,000 more visas in addition to the ones already allocated for.
The Taliban have been advancing Afghanistan following a decision by Mr Biden to withdraw the remaining American troops from the country.
With those advances have come danger to those who worked alongside US troops during the two-decade conflict.
Since 2008, approximately 70,000 Afghans have been resettled in the US on an SIV .

The plant operator said in a statement it had shut Unit 1 at the Taishan nuclear plant in Guangdong province after ""lengthy"" talks with technicians.
Taishan is the first site in the world to have this kind of reactor.
The type of reactor - known as EPR - is also set to be built in other countries, including Finland, France and at Hinkley Point C in the UK.
The latest move comes a month after the Chinese government acknowledged damage to fuel rods at the Taishan unit, but said it was a ""common"" problem, with no need for concern.
China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN) said in a statement on Friday that the reactor was ""completely under control"".
Engineers would find the cause of the damage and replace the fuel rods, the statement read.
In June CNN reported the US government was assessing a reported leak at the site.
CNN said French energy firm EDF, which helps run the site, had warned the US government that China's nuclear regulator had raised limits on permissible levels of radiation outside the plant to avoid shutting it down.
EDF later said a problem with fuel rods had led to the build-up of gases, which had to be released into the atmosphere.
Fuel rods are sealed metal tubes which hold nuclear materials used to fuel the nuclear reactor.
Last week an EDF spokesperson told CNN the French company would shut the plant down if it could.
They said the decision lay with the Chinese operator.
The situation at Taishan was ""not an emergency"" but nevertheless a ""serious situation"", the spokesperson added.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its shares had soared by almost 50% in Thursday's pre-market trade after the Wall Street Journal report.
Since making its US market debut a month ago the company has been targeted by authorities in Beijing.
Meanwhile, some US senators have called on its financial markets regulator to investigate Chinese share listings.
""The rumors about the privatization of Didi are untrue, and the company is currently actively cooperating with cybersecurity reviews,"" the company said on Chinese social media platform Weibo.
The statement came in response to a Wall Street Journal report, which cited people familiar with the matter as saying Didi was considering delisting its share in the US as it faced increasing pressure from regulators in China.
Two days after Didi shares started trading on the New York Stock Exchange, China's internet regulator ordered online stores not to offer its app, saying it illegally collected users' personal data.
That sent the company's market value down sharply and it has now fallen by around a third since Didi raised $4.4bn (£3.15bn) in its initial public offering (IPO) a month ago.
On Thursday, a group of Republican senators called on the country's financial markets regulator to launch an inquiry into US-listed Chinese companies.
In the letter to the head of Securities and Exchanges Commission the seven lawmakers cited losses sustained by Didi investors after Beijing's took action against the company.
In recent months Chinese technology companies traded in the US, Hong Kong and mainland China have seen their share prices slump as Beijing tightens its grip on the industry.

Those who got their second jab at least five months ago would be eligible for a Pfizer booster from Sunday, he said.
President Isaac Herzog, who turns 61 in September, was the first to get the booster on Friday.
This comes amid a surge in infections in Israel, and concern in many countries over the highly contagious Delta variant.
""Findings show that there is a decline in the body's immunity over time,"" Mr Bennett said at a briefing on Thursday.
""The aim of the supplementary dose is to build it up again, and thus reduce the chances of infection and serious illness significantly.”
The prime minister added that 2,000 people with weakened immune systems had already received a third dose with no severe side effects.
Experts say it is not yet clear whether a third dose will reduce Covid cases.
Last month, the Israeli authorities reintroduced a requirement to wear masks indoors amid a rise in cases.
Israel has been one of the most successful countries in the world in tackling the pandemic.

It is thought to be the first-ever legal settlement of its kind.
Under the terms of the deal, claimants will be given compensation based on court-determined level of harm.
Money will also be set aside for a DNA database to allow dozens of children to identify their biological fathers.
The class-action lawsuit currently includes 226 people. Dr Barwin worked at two clinics in Ottawa, Ontario.
Some couples who were told that the male partner's sperm would be used were unknowingly given random samples, and in some cases, the doctor's own.
Some of the claims date back to the 1970s. Dr Barwin is now in his 80s and has not practiced since 2014.
The settlement must still be approved by a judge before any money will be made available.
Rebecca Dixon, 31, found out that her real father was Dr Barwin - whose clinic her parents had visited - after she developed a disease that nobody else in her family had. She and her parents launched the lawsuit in 2016.
""I am not sure we will ever achieve closure,"" she told the Ottawa-Citizen newspaper.
""It is something that will be with us for the rest of our lives. But the legal side wrapping up will allow people to come to a bit more peace with the situation.""
The proposal also calls for C$75,000 to be used to set up a database for children conceived at his clinics to find out the identity of their father. The purpose of the database will be to provide children with the opportunity to identify their biological fathers, gain access to medical history and to locate any half-siblings.
Dr Barwin and his lawyer had no comment on the matter, but the settlement does not require the former fertility doctor to admit any fault.
He ""has denied and continues to deny all of the plaintiffs' claims in this action,"" lawyers said in court documents filed on Wednesday.
In 2019, Dr Barwin was stripped of his medical license by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, which called his actions ""beyond reprehensible"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Numbers of US troops are likely to stay the same but the move is being seen as an attempt to help the Iraqi PM.

Political parties aligned to Iran have demanded the withdrawal of all forces from the US-led global coalition against IS, despite the continuing threat posed by the Sunni jihadist group.
Shia militias have meanwhile been accused by the US of carrying out hundreds of rocket, mortar and drone attacks on Iraqi military bases that host coalition forces in an apparent attempt to pressure them to leave.

The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index, which follows the 98 biggest US-listed Chinese stocks, has fallen by almost 15% in the last two trading sessions.
The index has now plummeted by more than 45% since hitting a record high in February.
The slump comes after a series of crackdowns by Beijing on its technology and education industries.
This has led to around $770bn (£556bn) being wiped off the value of US-listed Chinese stocks in the last five months alone.
The latest blow came as Beijing unveiled a massive overhaul of China's $120bn private tutoring sector, under which all institutions offering tuition on school curricula will be registered as non-profit organisations.
The new rules also said: ""Curriculum subject-tutoring institutions are not allowed to go public for financing; listed companies should not invest in the institutions, and foreign capital is barred from such institutions.""
