earthquake,"Deadly earthquake hits Indonesia: Dozens killed, hundreds injured","The earthquake unleashed dozens of aftershocks, some six kilometres northeast of the city of Majene,  causing heavy damage across the city, including to the five-story Mitra Manakarra Hospital where eight people were reportedly trapped inside.  
“The Governor’s office, two hotels, a mall, a community health centre, and over 300 houses also sustained damage”, said the spokesperson for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Jens Laerke. 
Local authorities have reported that 638 people have been injured and more than 18,000 have been temporarily displaced to 10 evacuation sites.  
However, these numbers are expected to increase as assessments continue.  
“The earthquake interrupted the access road between?Majene?and the provincial capital?Mamuju?in three different locations”, said Mr. Laerke.  
“Electricity, communications network and fuel supply have also been disrupted”, he added.
The OCHA spokesperson pointed out that the earthquake?followed?a 5.7 magnitude shock that rocked the same area on Thursday afternoon.? 
The chief of Indonesia’s Meteorology and Geophysics agency, Dwikorita Karnawati, warned that strong aftershocks could follow, telling a news conference that there had already been at least 26, after the two quakes had rocked the area, since Thursday afternoon. 
“The structures of the materials and rocks under the earth are unstable or weak after 28 tremors, and these may cause an underwater landslide and trigger a tsunami”, she said, recommending that people stay away from the coast if another strong quake strikes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
earthquake,Indonesia earthquake: dozens dead after tremors and landslides hit Sulawesi,"Thousands flee for safety and higher ground after island’s second quake in 24 hours
At least 37 people have been killed and hundreds injured following a strong earthquake that shook the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia early on Friday morning, prompting landslides and destroying houses.
Thousands of people fled their homes to seek safety when the 6.2-magnitude earthquake hit just after 1am local time on Friday morning. The epicentre was 6km north-east of Majene city in West Sulawesi.
Hundreds of buildings were destroyed or damaged, including a hospital, which collapsed with more than a dozen patients and staff trapped beneath it.
“The hospital is flattened,” said Arianto, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, from the rescue agency in Mamuju city, near Majene. Rescuers were also trying to reach a family of eight buried beneath the rubble of their destroyed home, he told AFP.
At least 37 people have been killed in Majene and Mamuju, and rescue workers fear the death toll will rise further. “Many of the dead are buried under rubble,” said Ali Rahman, the head of the local disaster mitigation agency in Mamuju.

Hundreds of people in coastal areas fled to higher ground for fear of a tsunami, but no alert was issued.
An 8.8-magnitude quake in the same area last February caused huge destruction.
Chile's national emergency agency (Onemi) said there was no danger of a tsunami.
""Up until now we don't have any reports of injuries, there's no damage, just overloaded telephone lines and some partial power cuts,"" said Onemi's director, Vicente Nunez.
""We've told people to go back to their houses because there's no tsunami alert.""
The quake hit at 1720 (2020 GMT) and was centred about 600 kilometres (370 miles) southwest of the capital, Santiago.
The University of Chile's Institute of Seismology put the magnitude at 6.9.

earthquake,,"An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 struck off southern Alaska's coast late Tuesday, shaking the Alaska Peninsula and briefly sparking tsunami concerns before officials said no destructive waves were coming.
The earthquake was centered in the Pacific Ocean about 60 miles southeast of Perryville on the sparsely populated Alaska Peninsula, striking around 10:12 p.m. local time (2:12 a.m. Wednesday ET).
The Alaska Peninsula protrudes from mainland Alaska and is flanked to the southwest by the Aleutian Islands.
Reports of significant damage, if any, weren't immediately available. A tsunami warning initially was issued for south Alaska and the Alaska Peninsula, but was canceled by early Wednesday, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The warning sent people to higher ground in cities like Sand Point, an island community of about 1,000 people off the peninsula, the Anchorage Daily News reported.
People in Sand Point gathered at a high school until shortly after midnight, when officials gave an all-clear, Jordan Keeler, an Anchorage-based city administrator, told the newspaper.
""The first wave didn't materialize, which is a great thing,"" Keeler, who was in contact with staff in Sand Point, told the Anchorage Daily News. No reports of major structural damage were made on the island, Keeler told the newspaper.
""We've canceled the (tsunami) advisories because it doesn't look like it's becoming a large wave or any larger,"" National Tsunami Warning Center Director James Gridley said, according to CNN affiliate KTUU.
Strong shaking was reported on the peninsula, the USGS said. Light to weak shaking was reported around Kodiak, about 300 miles northeast of the quake's center, and in Anchorage, some 530 miles from the center, according to the USGS.
In Kodiak, a city of about 6,000 people, a long line of cars headed up a mountain after residents learned of the tsunami warning late Tuesday, John Cannon told KTUU.
Police were ""trying to clear the lower areas down by the harbor,"" he said.
""You (could) hear the tsunami alarms. It's rather eerie,"" he told KTUU.
This quake's depth was 28 kilometers, or 17 miles, the USGS said -- relatively shallow.
""Anything below 70 kilometers is considered a shallow quake,"" CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar said. ""That's important, because shallow earthquakes often cause the most damage, compared to the ones that are deeper, regardless of the strength.""

earthquake,,"A strong 7.3-magnitude earthquake struck off Japan's east coast late Saturday, rattling the region hit by the powerful 2011 quake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown just weeks before the disaster's 10th anniversary.
The quake produced powerful shaking along parts of Japan's eastern coast, and was felt strongly in Tokyo, but triggered no tsunami alert.
Kyodo news agency reported at least 30 people injured, but gave no further details.
There were no immediate reports of significant damage, though local news broadcast images of a landslide on a highway.
Japan's meteorological agency said the quake hit at 11:08 pm (1408 GMT) at a depth of 60 kilometres (37 miles) in the Pacific off Fukushima -- near the epicentre of the 2011 killer quake which triggered a towering tsunami and killed more than 18,000 people.
The agency initially reported the strength of the quake as 7.1, but later revised the figure upwards. It said the quake was considered an aftershock of the massive 2011 temblor.
Aftershocks continued to rattle the region in the hours afterwards and officials cautioned local residents to be vigilant. A handful of people were reported to have sought shelter at evacuation centres.
""We are working quickly to collect information but we still have no details to announce. There were some unconfirmed reports about landslides but we are still checking,"" Mikihiro Meguro, an official from the Fukushima prefectural government, told AFP.
Around 950,000 homes lost power throughout the affected region, but no abnormalities were reported at the Fukushima nuclear plant, which melted down in the wake of the 2011 tsunami.
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga was called to his office, and broadcaster NHK said the government would set up a special liaison office to coordinate with affected regions.
""All messed up""
Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato addressed reporters after midnight and said evaluations were under way.
""As far as damage, casualties and structural damage are being assessed,"" he said, adding that sections of the bullet train had been suspended due to power outages.
""Surveys are being done at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant,"" he said.
""We have received reports that Onagawa nuclear plant and Fukushima Daichi nuclear plant are not showing any abnormality,"" he added.

earthquake,,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- One of the biggest earthquakes to hit the South Pacific in modern history forced thousands of people in New Zealand to evacuate and triggered tsunami warnings across the world Friday, but it did not appear to cause injuries or major damage because it struck in remote ocean.
The magnitude 8.1 quake was the largest in a series of tremors that hit the region over several hours, including two earlier quakes that registered magnitude 7.4 and magnitude 7.3.
The earthquakes triggered warning systems and caused traffic jams and some chaos in New Zealand as people scrambled to get to higher ground, but their remoteness meant they did not appear to pose a widespread threat to lives or infrastructure.
The largest quake struck about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) off the coast of New Zealand. One of the earlier quakes hit much closer to New Zealand and awoke many people as they felt a long, rumbling shaking.
“Hope everyone is ok out there,” New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern wrote on Facebook during the night.
After the largest quake, civil defense authorities in New Zealand told people in some coastal areas to immediately get to higher ground. They said a damaging tsunami was possible, and waves could reach up to 3 meters (10 feet).
Emergency Management Minister Kiri Allan told reporters that people had followed the advisory.
“They felt the long or strong earthquakes and they knew to grab their bag and head into the highlands,” she said. “I can only thank and acknowledge the tireless efforts of the men and women from up and down the coast who knew how to act, when to act, and what to do.”
She warned that the threat could remain throughout much of the afternoon and people should not return home until authorities gave the all-clear. Allan said evacuations took precedence over coronavirus distancing measures.
The U.S. Tsunami Warning System also cautioned the quake could cause tsunami waves of up to 3 meters (10 feet) in Vanuatu and up to 1 meter (3 feet) in Australia, Fiji, French Polynesia and as far away as Mexico and Peru.
The U.S. Geological Survey said it was centered near the remote Kermadec Islands at a depth of 19 kilometers (12 miles).
The agency said in a report that the quake occurred at the intersection of the Pacific and Australia tectonic plates and eclipsed the largest quake previously recorded in the region, a magnitude 8.0 in 1976.
It said the interaction between the plates creates one of the most seismically active regions in the world, and it has recorded 215 quakes there above magnitude 6.0 over the past century.
Jennifer Eccles, an earthquake expert at the University of Auckland, said the quake was at the top end of the scale for those involving only the Earth's ocean crust.
“This is about as big as it gets,” she said.
She said most quakes larger than magnitude 8.0 tend to occur when a section of more robust continental crust is involved.
The U.S. Geological Survey said the magnitude 7.4 quake was likely a “foreshock” that contributed to the larger quake but that the first quake that hit closer to New Zealand was too far away in time and distance to have directly contributed.
Officials in New Zealand had hours earlier issued a tsunami warning for coastal areas after the first quake struck off its northeastern coast at about 2:30 a.m. Friday. There were no immediate reports of serious damage or casualties, and the warning was lifted just before the largest quake hit.
The U.S. Geological Survey said the first quake was centered at a depth of 21 kilometers (13 miles) under the ocean about 174 kilometers (108 miles) northeast of the city of Gisborne.
It was widely felt in New Zealand, and residents in the major cities of Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch reported being shaken awake.

earthquake,,"AS SO often with earthquakes, this one started almost imperceptibly. It was lunchtime, and people in Tokyo are apt to take tremors lightly. It took just a frozen heartbeat, though, for that to change. One of us was seated at a coffee shop along a huge slab of oak that sat 14. It shook so violently, people raced outside. Another of us was next to a busy kitchen; metal pots shook, then crashed off the shelves, and with the noise diners came rushing up from tables in the basement and out into the streets. Within minutes, Tokyo's narrow alleys were choked with people, some visibly shocked, most eerily quiet, listening to the clanking power lines overhead, and quite understandably bereft without mobile-phone signals. As I walked onto one of the shopping boulevards of Omote-Sando, a sea of evacuees from the buildings that run along it let out a roar of fear when a second—and then a third—aftershock hit. As cars swayed, and trees lurched overhead, you could feel the power of the beast writhing underneath Japan.
The country has long prepared for something like this—and it showed. Friends quickly offered advice. Stay in open spaces; when back at home, fill up your bath and your rice cooker, so that there is plenty of food and water in reserve. Though phone signals were mostly dead (apparently to leave bandwidth for emergency services), the internet functioned. That meant e-mail and Skype worked, and Facebook and Twitter conveyed news, tips and just the sort of offbeat information that is uplifting in the face of adversity (according to one Facebook rumour, this being Japan, airlines are generously offering cheap flights for anyone wanting to leave the country).

earthquake,,"The most surprising thing about the magnitude-8.9 earthquake that hit Japan today is that it was a surprise. Despite what may be the world's most intensive effort to map faults and assess risks by a notoriously earthquake-prone and earthquake-conscious nation, such a strong quake was not anticipated for the region, says University of Tokyo geophysicist Robert Geller.
The earthquake occurred 130 kilometers east of Sendai and 373 kilometers northeast of Tokyo, along or very near the boundary between two tectonic plates, where the Pacific plate is being drawn under the Japanese islands. Movement along plate boundaries is known to be capable of producing major earthquakes. And Japan's latest national seismic risk map gave a 99% chance of a magnitude-7.5 or greater quake occurring in that area in the next 30 years, Geller says.
Although today's quake technically satisfies that prediction, the logarithmic scale used for measuring the power of earthquakes means that a magnitude-8.9 earthquake releases well over 100 times more energy than does a magnitude-7.5 quake.

earthquake,,"At 12.51 p.m. on Tuesday 22 February 2011, a magnitude 6.3 earthquake caused severe damage in Christchurch and Lyttelton, killing 185 people and injuring several thousand.
The earthquake’s epicentre was near Lyttelton, just 10 km south-east of Christchurch’s central business district. It occurred nearly six months after the 4 September 2010 earthquake.
The earthquake struck at lunchtime, when many people were on the city streets. More than 130 people lost their lives in the collapse of the Canterbury Television and Pyne Gould Corporation buildings. Falling bricks and masonry killed another 11 people, while eight died in two city buses that were crushed by crumbling walls. Rock cliffs collapsed in the Sumner and Redcliffs area, and boulders tumbled down the Port Hills, with five people killed by falling rocks.
Although not as powerful as the magnitude 7.1 earthquake on 4 September 2010, this earthquake occurred on a shallow fault line close to the city, so the shaking was particularly destructive.
The earthquake brought down many buildings damaged the previous September, especially older brick and mortar buildings. Heritage buildings that suffered heavy damage included the Provincial Council Chambers, Lyttelton’s Timeball Station, the Anglican Christchurch Cathedral and the Catholic Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament. Two-thirds of the buildings in the central business district were subsequently demolished, including the city’s tallest building, the Hotel Grand Chancellor.
Liquefaction was much more extensive than in September 2010. Shaking turned water-saturated layers of sand and silt beneath the surface into sludge that squirted upwards through cracks. Thick layers of silt covered properties and streets, and water and sewage from broken pipes flooded streets. House foundations cracked and buckled, wrecking many homes. Irreparable damage necessitated the demolition of several thousand homes, and large tracts of suburban land were subsequently abandoned, with 8,000 properties bought by the government and razed.",https://nzhistory.govt.nz/page/christchurch-earthquake-kills-185,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Witnesses reported strong shaking but there was no immediate word of casualties or heavy damage. The quake was centered 86 miles northwest of Montego Bay, Jamaica, and 87 miles west-southwest of Niquero, Cuba. It hit at 2:10 p.m. and the epicenter was a relatively shallow 6 miles beneath the surface. The quake could be felt strongly in Santiago, the largest city in eastern Cuba, said Belkis Guerrero, who works in a Catholic cultural center in the center of Santiago “We were all sitting and we felt the chairs move,” she said. “We heard the noise of everything moving around.” She said there was no apparent damage in the heart of the colonial city. “It felt very strong but it doesn’t look like anything happened,” she told The Associated Press. The quake also hit the Cayman Islands, leaving cracked roads and what appeared to be sewage spilling from cracked mains. There were no immediate reports of deaths, injuries or more severe damage, said Kevin Morales, editor-in-chief of the Cayman Compass newspaper. The islands see so few earthquakes that newsroom staff were puzzled when it hit, he said. “‘It was just like a big dump truck was rolling past,”‘ Morales said. “Then it continued and got more intense.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He said a team of engineers will inspect the damage in the next week or so, and he’s confident that it looks worse than it actually is.  “We have two docks total and they are both closed, effective immediately until we can get an inspection to verify the extent of the damage to both the new dock and the old dock,” Keeler said.  In the meantime, closing down the docks could mean that freight shipments will be cancelled until they reopen. That could impact the island community’s ability to get fresh food, he added.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

earthquake,,"Large earthquake off Alaska prompts tsunami fears, fleeing A magnitude 7.5 earthquake prompted a tsunami warning Monday for a nearly thousand-mile stretch of Alaska’s southern coast, with waves over 2 feet at the nearest community as the threat subsided. The quake was centered near Sand Point, a city of about 900 people off the Alaska Peninsula where wave levels late Monday topped 2 feet (0.61 meters), according to the National Tsunami Warning Center. The warning was downgraded to an advisory just over two hours after the quake hit. “It was a pretty good shaker here,” said David Adams, co-manager of Marine View Bed and Breakfast in Sand Point. “You could see the water kind of shaking and shimmering during the quake. Our truck was swaying big time.” Adams didn’t take any photos or video: “It just kind of happened all of a sudden.” The quake struck in the North Pacific Ocean just before 1 p.m. It was centered about 67 miles (118 kilometers) southeast of Sand Point, according to the Alaska Earthquake Center. The community is about 800 miles (1,288 km) southwest of Anchorage. The quake was recorded at a depth of 19 miles (30 kilometers). The National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, Alaska, said the tsunami warning — and later advisory — was in effect for roughly 950 miles (1,529 kilometers), from 40 miles (64 kilometers) southeast of Homer to Unimak Pass, about 80 miles (129 km) northeast of Unalaska. The quake was felt widely in communities along the southern coast, including Sand Point, Chignik, Unalaska and the Kenai Peninsula, according to the Alaska Earthquake Center, which said a magnitude 5.2 aftershock was reported 11 minutes later, centered roughly in the same area. Patrick Mayer, superintendent of the Aleutians East Borough School District, said parents picked up their children from Sand Point School, which also served an evacuation point. The earthquake was felt to varying degrees at the other four schools in the district, the closest of which is 90 miles away, he said. Mayer said a school bus was dispatched to a fish processing facility to bring workers to the school since it’s on high ground. The workers were to wear masks to protect against the spread of the coronavirus, he said, in a community where there have been only “limited cases.” Public safety officials in King Cove urged residents to remain vigilant after the warning was downgraded and to stay off the beach and out of harbors and marinas. Waves by late afternoon in King Cove were less than 2 feet (0.61 meters), according to the National Tsunami Warning Center. The size of the quake was originally reported to have been a magnitude of 7.4, but was revised to a 7.5, said Paul Caruso, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey. He said an earthquake of this size, in this area, is not a surprise. “This is an area where the Pacific Plate is subducting underneath the North American Plate. And because of that, the Pacific Plate actually goes underneath the North American Plate, where it melts,” Caruso said, noting that’s why there are volcanoes in the region. “And so we commonly have large, magnitude 7 earthquakes in that area.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The warning was later downgraded to an advisory by the National Weather Service. An initial earthquake with a 7.5 magnitude occurred around Sand Point, Alaska, a city on one of the Shumagin Islands, just before 1 p.m. local time (5 p.m. E.T.), according to the Official U.S. Geological Survey. An aftershock hit the area about 20 minutes later at a magnitude of 5.8, the USGS said. The National Weather Service issued a tsunami warning for the Pacific coasts from Kennedy Entrance, Alaska to Unimak Pass, Alaska. Police in Homer, Alaska, asked anyone in the potential flooding zone to move to higher ground immediately in fear of a potential tsunami. Sand Point, where the earthquake appears to have originated, is about 575 nautical miles southwest of Anchorage. The city is on Popof Island, one of 20 islands in the Aleutians East Borough south of the mainland.

The quake Monday was first reported as magnitude-7.4 and was revised to a 7.5 before the latest revision. There was no major damage from the quake or tsunami. Don Blakeman, a geophysicist with the National Earthquake Information Center, said magnitudes are calculated using various mathematical formulas. He said revisions can occur as agencies contribute information or add more analysis.

But the threat is not over. Scientists said the melting glaciers in Alaska region could unleash a 'mega-tsunami,' with a destructive high wall of water. As per the scientists, the glacier retreat in Prince William Sound—a narrow sea channel on the south coast of the U.S. state of Alaska—is now destabilizing mountain slopes and a massive tsunami could appear as early as 2021. A group of experts in an open letter to Alaskan authorities said that collapsing mountain slopes in Alaska caused 633 feet high waves in 2015. The researchers also noted that in west Greenland, a landslide in June 2017 produced a tsunami that killed four people and destroyed a large portion of the town of Nuugaatsiaq. According to the findings, the tsunami could impact areas frequently visited by tourists, fishing vessels, and hunters. The team of scientists believes that there is a possibility that this landslide-led tsunami ""will happen within the next year, and likely within 20 years.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

earthquake,,"7.7-magnitude earthquake generates small South Pacific tsunami NOUMEA: A 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck in the South Pacific on Thursday (Feb 11), generating a small tsunami that caused no damage to island nations in the region before authorities gave the all clear. The quake struck at just after midnight on Thursday local time (9.20pm on Wednesday, Singapore time) about 415 kilometres east of Vao in New Caledonia at a depth of 10 kilometres, according to the US Geological Survey. The US government's NWS Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said ""hazardous tsunami waves"" were forecast for some coasts. It said waves reaching between 0.3 and one metre above the tide level were possible for Fiji, New Zealand and Vanuatu. A wave of 0.3 metres struck Fiji, according to the Twitter feed of the island nation's seismology department. However, Fiji Seismology later cancelled its tsunami warning. ""The seismology observatory upon its assessments has now verified and confirmed the cancellation of the warning and 'all clear information' (is) issued to the whole Fiji group,"" it said. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology confirmed in a tweet that a tsunami had been generated. The bureau warned of a threat to Lord Howe Island, which is about 550 kilometres east of Australia's mainland, but said there was no need for evacuations. Locals in the Vanuatu capital Port Vila said they felt the quake but there was no damage from either the shake or subsequent waves. The New Zealand National Emergency Management Agency warned of ""strong and unusual currents"" in northern coastal areas but said there was no tsunami risk. ""There isn't a threat to land so we haven't issued a tsunami alert,"" the disaster agency's acting director Roger Ball told Radio New Zealand. He advised those in affected areas to ""stay out of the water and stay off the beaches"" but said the danger posed was not enough to warrant a nationwide warning. ""Waking everybody up at 4:00 or 5:00 am in the morning with emergency mobile alerts we didn't feel was a proportionate response,"" he said. There were no initial reports of casualties or damage from the tsunami or the quake, which was initially recorded by USGS at magnitude 7.5 before being revised to 7.7. The Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", where tectonic plates collide, experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity. In 2018, a 7.5-magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami on Indonesia's Sulawesi island left more than 4,300 people dead or missing. A 9.1-magnitude quake struck off the coast of Indonesia's Sumatra island in 2004, triggering a tsunami that killed 220,000 throughout the region. The death toll included around 170,000 in Indonesia - one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

earthquake,,"A series of aftershocks jolted central Croatia on Wednesday, a day after a 6.3-magnitude earthquake killed at least seven people, injured dozens and left several towns and villages in ruins.
Authorities warned that the coronavirus could spread in crowded shelters. Many people are in tents, their cars or military barracks.
The strongest, 4.7-magnitude tremor was recorded near the heavily damaged town of Petrinja, some 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of the capital, Zagreb.
Neven Pavkovic, a resident, said the aftershocks kept him awake: ""It was a rough night, I slept maybe half an hour.”
In the hard-hit village of Majske Poljane, where five people died, a little boy could be seen sleeping in a van on the chilly morning.
Sobbing villagers said they received blankets, food and other aid but don’t know what they will do next. Rain that fell overnight turned the dust from the rubble into mud, adding to the hardship.
“We can’t say ‘Good morning,’ It is not good,” Petrinja mayor Darinko Dumbovic told Croatian radio. “We had the third and fourth tremors this morning, short ones but strong. What hasn’t fallen off before is falling now from the ruins of Petrinja.”
“Fear has crept into people,"" he said.
Pope Francis prayed for the victims. At the end of his weekly audience, he said: ”I particularly pray for those who died and for their families.”
Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said the government will declare Saturday a day of national mourning. As the government abolished a travel ban between counties that was imposed during the holidays because of the coronavirus pandemic, Plenkovic appealed for respect for other measures.
“We are still fighting COVID-19, it wouldn’t be good to relax now,” Plenkovic said at a government session.
The International Committee of the Red Cross said it had deployed its Croatian staff in the quake-hit area, and warned of the possible spread of the coronavirus amid the emergency.

Typhoon,"Super Typhoon Goni, world’s most powerful storm in four years, smashes into the Philippines","MANILA — Super Typhoon Goni, the world's most powerful storm in four years, crashed through the Philippines on Sunday, smashing buildings, toppling trees, and causing floods and mudslides. At least 10 people were reported dead as of Monday morning.
Peak winds were estimated at 195 mph early Sunday before Goni slammed into Catanduanes Island, home to more than 260,000 people. Those winds, equivalent to those of a strong Category 5 hurricane, made the storm comparable to Super Typhoon Haiyan, the catastrophic cyclone that devastated Tacloban City in the Philippines in 2013 and killed more than 6,000 people. The winds were similar to those of Typhoon Meranti, which struck the Philippines in 2016.
Goni landed in a country already reeling from two typhoons in the past two weeks, the coronavirus pandemic, a recession and a record unemployment rate this year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,Typhoon Goni: Philippines hit by year's most powerful storm,"Typhoon Goni is barrelling across the Philippines, bringing with it ""catastrophic"" winds and rain.
At least 10 people have died amid reports of storm surges, flash floods, power outages and blown-off roofs.
Goni made landfall as a super typhoon at Catanduanes island on Sunday at 04:50 local time (19:50 GMT Saturday) packing winds of 225km/h (140mph).
It has since weakened, but is still wreaking damage across the main Luzon island, home to the capital Manila.
President Rodrigo Duterte is monitoring the disaster response from his home in Davao city, a presidential spokesman said.
Mark Timbal of the Philippines' national disaster agency said that 19 million people may have been affected by the path of Goni. ""This 19 million already includes the populations in danger zones for landslides, flooding, storm surges and even a lava flow,"" he told the BBC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its the Philippines’ nineteenth named storm for year 2020. Typhoon Goni is considered as the strongest landfalling tropical cyclone in world recorded history.
At its peak strength on landfall on Catanduanes and Albay, Super Typhoon Goni caused widespread damage to high-risk structures and almost total damage to structures made of light materials in the highly exposed coastal areas. Many roof failures were observed in houses and industrial buildings. Electrical power distribution and communication services were severely disrupted. Water systems were severely damaged. Agriculture and livelihoods were severely affected. In one area, on the slopes, of Mayon Volcano there was a lahar flow that caused the near total destruction of one village.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,Typhoon could hit Port of Hong Kong this weekend,"Hong Kong may have to brace for a typhoon slamming its large container port this weekend.
A cluster of thunderstorms over the Philippines has the potential to become a typhoon during the next couple of days. This would be the second named storm of the 2020 Pacific typhoon season. The first was Typhoon Vongfong, known as Typhoon Ambo in the Philippines, which hit that island nation in May. The season runs throughout the year, but most Pacific typhoons develop from May through October.
This storm, which would be named Typhoon Nuri, will likely track over the northern Philippines on Friday, June 12, moving into southeastern China over the weekend. The projected track takes the storm close to Hong Kong on Sunday, June 14.
The potential typhoon could delay various services, from container cargo to cruises and public transportation.
Hong Kong is one of the busiest container ports in the world, according to the Hong Kong Maritime and Port Board website. It handled 18.3 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) of containers in 2019, and provided about 300 container liner services per week connecting to around 420 destinations worldwide.The Port of Hong Kong is also home to cruise liners and government fleets, and it operates ferries between Hong Kong and mainland China.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,Typhoon Nuri lands in Hong Kong,"Typhoon Nuri weakened to a severe tropical storm as it landed in Hong Kong on Friday, bringing strong winds and rainfall but inflicting little damage.
No major destruction was reported, unlike in the Philippines, where Nuri killed seven people and triggered landslides and floods in the north.
But with Nuri landing in Hong Kong late Friday afternoon, the Hong Kong Observatory said it had weakened from a typhoon to a severe tropical storm. By late Friday night, the storm was headed northwest toward the southern Chinese city Guangzhou.
In Hong Kong, a man went missing while swimming off a local beach and 11 people were injured during the storm, with three in serious condition, the government said in a statement.
There also were reports of toppled trees, collapsed walls and scaffoldings.
The Hong Kong Observatory issued its second-highest tropical cyclone warning.
Flights, bus and ferry services were canceled, and offices, schools and financial markets were closed. At least 388 passenger flights were either canceled or delayed and another 15 diverted, the government said in a statement.
Officials have evacuated 87,000 people and recalled more than 45,000 vessels in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
The bad weather didn't affect the Olympic equestrian competition, which finished late Thursday.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,Typhoon Nuri barrels into Hong Kong,"Typhoon Nuri lashed Hong Kong with heavy rain and strong winds sparking major flight delays, disruption to public transport and a halt to trade on the city's financial markets.
Many offices in the southern Chinese territory were closed, and ferry services suspended as meteorologists issued the level-eight storm signal, signifying the likelihood of gale-force winds.
At 11:00 am, the typhoon was centred about 100 kilometres (60 miles) east-southeast of Hong Kong and was moving towards the city at a speed of about 14 kilometres an hour.
""Nuri will be rather close to Hong Kong this afternoon and ON Friday night with a chance of a direct hit,"" a spokesman for the Hong Kong Observatory said.
Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacific and its sister company Dragonair announced that all flights would be cancelled for 12 hours starting at 2:00 pm (0600 GMT).

Typhoon,Tropical Storm Nuri threatening Southeast Asian ports,"On Wednesday, Tropical Storm Butchoy was just a cluster of thunderstorms over that nation. FreightWaves reported on the potential for this storm to intensify, and now mainland China is bracing for impact.
The storm — known as Tropical Storm Nuri in China — will travel across the South China Sea this weekend, maintaining tropical storm status. As of 11 a.m. EDT Friday (11 p.m. Friday Hong Kong time), its sustained winds were 40 mph, with gusts of 50.
The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has issued a T1 tropical cyclone warning. This indicates that a tropical cyclone is centered within 500 miles (800 km) of Hong Kong, which may affect the city and its ports.
Winds and swells in Hong Kong are expected to gradually increase Saturday. The HKO will consider issuing the T3 strong wind warning depending on how badly conditions deteriorate. Meteorologists with the HKO are predicting gale force winds up to 54 mph for Saturday, flirting with severe tropical storm status (55 to 73 mph).
There’s a slim chance Nuri could strengthen into a typhoon — winds of at least 74 mph, like an Atlantic hurricane.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,"Hurricane Iota Makes Landfall In Nicaragua, Region Braces For 'Catastrophic' Impact","Hurricane Iota has made landfall in Nicaragua as a Category 4 storm, with the Central American region bracing for the possibility of catastrophic damage.
Iota crossed into Nicaragua near the town of Haulover, approximately 15 miles south of where Hurricane Eta also struck as a Category 4 on Nov. 3.
Nicaragua, along with Honduras, Guatemala, and southern Belize, which are flanked by the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean, are still trying to recover from the widespread devastation caused by Hurricane Eta, which left tens of thousands homeless.
At the time, Eta was the strongest storm to ever hit Nicaragua in the month of November.
The National Hurricane Center has warned of ""catastrophic winds, life-threatening storm surge, and torrential rainfall"" across Central America from the latest storm.
When it made landfall, Iota had sustained winds of 155 mph _ a Category 4 hurricane, but by 4 a.m. ET, it had lost strength, becoming a Category 2 storm, with winds at 105 mph, according to the U.S.-based National Hurricane Center. The storm was centered about 10 miles east-northeast of El Pia, Nicaragua. Before making landfall, Iota reached Category 5 for a time.
Besides Iota's incredible strong winds — expected to rip apart roofs and shatter some buildings completely — it is also bringing a massive storm surge, rain and flooding. Water is always the biggest killer in any tropical event and this will be no exception; Iota is a ""bigger"" storm than Eta in terms of how wide the windfield is. That means more people will feel the effects of the storm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,Hurricane Iota Now a ‘Catastrophic’ Category 5 Storm,"U.S. forecasters say Hurricane Iota has strengthened to a catastrophic Category 5 storm as it nears landfall with Nicaragua.
In its latest report, the National Hurricane Center says Iota is closing in on Nicaragua, where it is expected to bring “catastrophic winds, life-threatening storm surge, and torrential rainfall.”
Iota, currently packing maximum sustained winds of 260 kilometers per hour, is expected to make landfall in almost the exact location where Hurricane Eta came ashore two weeks ago.
Authorities in Honduras and Nicaragua rushed to evacuate their respective citizens from coastal areas Monday ahead of the storm.
""What's drawing closer is a bomb,"" Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez said at a news conference alongside Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei.
Hurricane Eta killed at least 50 people, destroyed buildings, knocked out power and caused flooding and landslides.
Iota is the record-breaking 30th named storm of the 2020 hurricane season. Along with Eta, it marks the first time that two major hurricanes have formed in the month of November.
It is also the 10th named storm to strengthen by more than 55.5 kph in a 24-hour period. Meteorologists attribute the effect to warm waters in the southern Caribbean.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Laura is the seventh named storm to landfall in the US this season, which has just begun what is traditionally its most intense period. It intensified within 24 hours from a Category 1 to a strong Category 4 on the Saffir Simson hurricane scale.
According to news reports, some 1,500 people are being sent into Louisiana for rescue and clean up missions, including troops from the National Guard. 
Winds of up to 150 mph caused severe damage, including the death of at least six people, and left half a million homes without power.

Typhoon,Unsurvivable surge': Laura makes landfall on Texas-Louisiana border,"Galveston, Texas: Hurricane Laura made landfall near Cameron in Louisiana on Thursday afternoon (AEST) as one of the region's worst hurricanes, threatening to devastate the US Gulf Coast with catastrophic storm surges, flash floods and powerful winds that could leave areas uninhabitable for weeks or months.
It came ashore as a category four storm with maximum winds of about 240km/h, according to the National Hurricane Centre. Laura is strong enough to rip down houses, uproot trees and cause power outages that could last weeks or even months.The storm is set to push a wall of water more than 6.1 metres high in some places on to shore, with potentially deadly effects - a catastrophic surge the centre earlier described as ""unsurvivable"".
It could inflict more than US15 billion (20 billion) in insured losses.
It is just a few kilometres per hour short of the most powerful storm category possible, and it's matching the previous record-breaker, the Lost Island Hurricane of 1856.
Some additional strengthening is possible before Laura reaches the north-west US Gulf of Mexico coast, the centre said. It's coming with more power than Hurricane Harvey when it made landfall in Texas in 2017.

Typhoon,,"Thick mud and debris coated many villages around the Philippine capital on Friday after a typhoon killed at least 42 people and caused extensive flooding that sent people fleeing to their roofs, officials said.
Troops, police, coast guard and disaster-response teams rescued tens of thousands of people, including many who flooded radio and TV networks and social media with desperate pleas for help.
Floodwaters receded and the weather cleared in many areas after Typhoon Vamco blew out into the South China Sea on Friday, but the military said it was still rescuing people trapped in some flooded communities.
Amphibious assault vehicles usually used in counter-insurgency operations were deployed for the rescue work, military chief of staff Gen. Gilbert Gapay said in a meeting with disaster-response officials.
“We’ll continue to look for the missing, help in damage assessment,” Gapay said.
The national police reported that the death toll had risen to at least 42 with 20 missing. The government’s main disaster-response agency, which waits for provincial reports and follows a laborious process of verifying casualties, reported a much lower death count, causing confusion.
Among the dead were at least 12 villagers who were dug out from mud and rockslides in the northern provinces of Cagayan and Nueva Vizcaya, police said.
After slamming into northeastern Quezon province, Vamco gained strength with sustained winds of 155 kilometers (96 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 255 kph (158 mph). It blew north of metropolitan Manila overnight Wednesday, toppling trees and power poles, swelling rivers, flooding residential communities and setting off landslides and storm surges.
In hard-hit Marikina city in the capital region and the towns of Rodriguez and Cainta in nearby Rizal province, several villages were inundated by water that reached the second and third floors of many houses, prompting hundreds of residents to flee to their roofs and call TV and radio networks or post desperate messages on social media. The panic was exacerbated by widespread power outages and loss of internet access.
Videos of Marikina showed a thick coat of muddy water covering roads and staining houses and cars. Residents carried appliances and furniture from their homes and used pails and shovels to remove the mud after the water receded.

Typhoon,,"A typhoon swelled rivers and flooded low-lying areas as it passed over the storm-battered northeastern Philippines, leaving at least 13 people dead and 15 others missing, officials said Thursday.
The Philippine National Police reported the casualty figures, but gave no details.
Typhoon Vamco passed north of Manila between Bulacan and Pampanga provinces, toppling trees and knocking out power. Officials said earlier that nearly 200,000 people had been evacuated, some forcibly, from vulnerable coastal and low-lying areas.
Officials said about 1.9 million households were without power in Metro Manila and nearby provinces. Many electricity poles were toppled, power lines were knocked down and power transformers were damaged.
President Rodrigo Duterte took a break from an online summit of Southeast Asian leaders to fly by helicopter over the affected areas.
“As president I guarantee you that your government will do its best to provide assistance in the form of shelters, relief goods, financial aid and post-disaster counseling. Rest assured, the government will not leave anybody behind. We will get through this crisis,” Duterte said in a televised address.
Rescue teams were deployed to flooded areas in Rizal province, coast guard chief Adm. George Ursabia told DZBB radio.
Marikina city Mayor Marcie Teodoro said fierce winds knocked down power lines overnight, leaving many areas without power and internet service. Heavy rains also flooded many areas and the Marikina River was swollen. Many people in Marikina city were waiting to be rescued from roofs.
“There are many areas that historically don’t get flooded but now they are swamped, like city hall,” he told DZBB radio.
Mark Timbal, spokesman for the government’s disaster response agency, said 363 rescue teams had been deployed consisting of 1,000 rescuers with at least 40 rubber boats.
The typhoon had maximum sustained winds of 130 kilometers per hour (80 mph) with stronger gusts Thursday morning. It was moving west-northwest at 30 kph (19 mph) and was headed for the South China Sea.
The government’s main disaster-response agency had pleaded to the media to relay typhoon alerts in northeastern areas devastated by an earlier typhoon, Goni, saying the agency’s messages could not be sent by cellphones due to damaged telecommunications systems.
Goni, one of the strongest typhoons in the world this year, left more than 30 people dead or missing and damaged or destroyed more than 270,000 houses, many in coastal villages. Tens of thousands of people remain displaced.

Typhoon,,"At least 20 people were killed as Typhoon Goni lashed the Philippines over the weekend, and about 13,000 shanties and houses were damaged or swept away in the eastern island province that was first hit by the ferocious storm, officials said Monday.
Goni blasted into Catanduanes province at dawn Sunday as a super typhoon with sustained winds of 225 kilometers (140 miles) per hour and gusts of 280 kph (174 mph). But it weakened considerably after making landfall and shifted direction to spare the capital, Manila, before blowing out into the South China Sea.
The Office of Civil Defense said at least 20 people were killed in Catanduanes and nearby Albay province.
Catanduanes, an island province of more than 260,000 people that is often lashed by Pacific storms, was isolated after losing power and communications due to Goni and another typhoon that had hit a week earlier. But officials there managed to connect to the outside world on Monday after disaster-response authorities flew to the devastated island with satellite phones.
Catanduanes Gov. Joseph Cua and other officials said the typhoon whipped up 5-meter (16-foot) storm surges and damaged or swept away about 13,000 houses. Many residents fled to safety from their homes as the typhoon approached.
More than 66,000 other houses and huts were damaged elsewhere in the region, officials said.
Cua described the onslaught as “severe” and reported that some coastal areas were swamped by frightening storm surges.
About 80% of the electricity posts on the island were toppled and roads linking the province’s 11 towns remained impassable, Cua said.
An army general on the island appealed for more troops to help distribute food packs and water to residents. He added that the army camp was destroyed by the typhoon and soldiers have camped out at the airport, which remained open.
An air force cargo plane was to deliver food packs, drinking water, blankets and other relief goods to the province.
The typhoon also devastated the nearby province of Albay, where heavy rains washed down boulders and mudflows from Mayon Volcano, engulfing about 150 houses in a single community in the town of Guinobatan, Albay Gov. Al Francis Bichara said.",https://apnews.com/article/typhoons-south-china-sea-philippines-storms-typhoon-goni-90748529b120afdab9b041d64af1f043,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"A super typhoon blew into the eastern Philippines with disastrous force Sunday, killing at least 10 people and triggering volcanic mudflows that engulfed about 150 houses before weakening as it blew away from the country, officials said.
Typhoon Goni blasted into the eastern island province of Catanduanes at dawn from the Pacific with sustained winds of 225 kilometers (140 miles) per hour and gusts of 280 kph (174 mph), threatening some provinces still recovering from a deadly typhoon that hit a week ago.
Goni barreled through densely populated regions and threatened to sideswipe Manila, which shut down its main airport, but shifted southward Sunday night and spared the capital, the government weather agency said.
At least nine people were killed in the hard-hit province of Albay, including a father and son. Villagers fled to safety as the typhoon approached, but the two apparently stayed put in the community in Guinobatan town where about 150 houses were inundated by volcanic mudflow.
“The child was found 15 kilometers (9 miles) away,” Albay Gov. Al Francis Bichara told DZMM radio, adding that the boy was swept away by mudflows and found in the next town.
He did not say whether there were any other residents trapped by the rampaging mudflows in the community and added that downed communications made it hard for people to communicate. The Office of Civil Defense reported that three Guinobatan residents were missing, but it was not immediately clear if they were from the mudflow-hit community.
The other deaths in Albay included a villager who was pinned by a fallen tree. One person was killed in Catanduanes province.

Ricardo Jalad, who heads the government’s disaster-response agency, had feared that the typhoon could wreak major damage due to its enormous force. The Philippine weather agency reinforced those concerns, saying that within 12 hours after the typhoon’s landfall, people could face “catastrophic, violent winds and intense to torrential rainfall.”
Residents were warned of possible landslides, massive flooding, storm surges of up to 5 meters (16 feet) and powerful winds that can blow away shanties. But after hitting a mountain range and repeatedly slamming into coastal provinces, the typhoon gradually weakened, although it remained potentially deadly as it blew out into the South China Sea, forecasters said.

Hagiput was a typhoon with winds blowing up to 137 kilometers (85 miles) per hour at its center when it made landfall in Zhejiang province in the early morning. At noon, the tropical storm had winds of up to 108 kph (67 mph) and was moving north at around 25 kph (16 mph), China’s National Meteorological Center said.
No major destruction or injuries have been reported. State broadcaster CCTV showed trees toppled in the Zhejiang city of Yuhuan and the fire service said a panel truck had been blown on its side by high winds early Tuesday and its driver rescued.
As of Tuesday evening, the storm center was located near the city of Shaoxing, about 160 kilometers (100 miles) south of Shanghai, according to the meteorological center’s website. Shanghai was hot and windy in the evening with sporadic showers.
Forecaster Zhang Ling told state broadcaster CCTV that the storm was continuing to weaken as it moved.
“The effects will be felt (in China) through Wednesday,” Zhang said. However, rainfall will have peaked by the end of Tuesday, she said.

This year’s typhoon season has been relatively mild in China, although flooding since June along its major river systems has caused scores of deaths, forced around 2 million people to be evacuated and caused more than 49 billion yuan (7 billion) in damage.",https://apnews.com/article/typhoons-tropical-storms-shanghai-storms-china-5d425620ae200024ba069f86afef4b94,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"China issued its top warning for coastal areas of Zhejiang province Friday ahead of a strong typhoon carrying heavy rain and winds and expected to send an intense storm surge up the mighty Yangzte River.
Heavy rain was expected in Zhejiang, Shanghai and nearby provinces on Friday before Typhoon Lekima hits land on Saturday morning, then weakens as it moves north.
Parts of northern Taiwan closed offices and suspended classes at schools on Friday as the storm passed northeast of the island. The same area was hit by a magnitude 6.0 earthquake Thursday that caused minor damage but no deaths or injuries.
The red alert China issued is the most serious in its four-tired alert system, prompting authorities to prepare evacuations, suspend train and air travel and require vessels to return to port. In Zhejiang, ferry service had been cancelled and more than 200 tourists evacuated from popular Beiji island.
The National Meteorological Center said Lekima was gusting at 209 kph (130 mph) and traveling northwesterly at 13 kph (8 mph). Taiwan’s Central Weather Bureau put its sustained winds at 173 kph (108 mph) and said the bands of wind and rains around the storm’s eye were shrinking.
The State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters warned authorities overseeing seven provinces including Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangsu and Shanghai Municipality to make preparations and have emergency response systems ready to be deployed. In Zhejiang, nearly 5,000 fishing boats had been recalled to port, authorities reported.
An intense storm surge was expected to raise waters in the estuary of the Yangzte River, China’s mightiest, beginning Friday. Three main streams of the Yangzte River are likely to exceed alert levels and the commission overseeing the river for the Ministry of Water Resources has ordered efforts to prevent floods and oversaturation of levees along the river’s banks.",https://apnews.com/article/ap-top-news-international-news-shanghai-storms-typhoons-e5545b68614a469e856d45abb882d40f,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cleanup of debris from the 2020 storms on state roadways in other parishes already had been completed.

Typhoon,,"Hurricane Delta, which made landfall about 11 miles (about 18 kilometers) from where the devastating Hurricane Laura hit a little more than a month earlier, cost 2.9 billion in the United States and was linked to six deaths in the U.S. and Mexico, according to a report from the National Hurricane Center.
The report released Tuesday details the hurricane’s origins, trajectory and things such as wind speed and storm surge when it made landfall in southwestern Louisiana.
The Center releases similar reports on every named storm that hits during a season. The reports on some of the 2020 season’s most devastating hurricanes - including Laura, Iota and Zeta - have yet to be published.
In the United States, two people died as a direct result of Delta — a 19-year-old woman and a 49-year-old man who both drowned in rip currents near Destin, Florida — and there were two indirect deaths associated with electrocutions and fires. In Mexico, there were two indirect deaths — an electrocution and a fall — linked to the hurricane.
The Center classifies deaths as direct or indirect. Direct deaths are those considered directly tied to the storm such as drowning in storm surge or being in a house that collapses from wind. Someone who dies of a heart attack during a storm or is electrocuted by a downed power line, for example, is considered an indirect death.
The hurricane came ashore as a Category 2 storm with winds of 97 miles per hour (156 miles per hour) and produced a storm surge that got up to nine feet (2.7 meters) in some areas east of where it made landfall near Creole, the report said. While Laura’s earlier damage came through devastating winds, Delta produced huge rain totals in some areas particularly between Lake Charles and Alexandria. Nearly 18 inches of rain fell in LeBleu Settlement northeast of Lake Charles, the report said.
The Center also released a report Tuesday on Hurricane Marco. That storm, which came days before the much more destructive Laura made landfall on August 27, was originally thought to have made landfall at the mouth of the Mississippi River on Aug. 24 based on satellite imagery. But in the report, the Center said further research suggests it stayed just south and did not actually make landfall. There were no reports of casualties linked to the storm and only minor damage.
The 2020 Atlantic hurricane season set multiple records while producing a record 30 named storms. There were so many that the list of 21 conventional names was exhausted and the Greek alphabet was used for only the second time. The season also saw the second-highest number of hurricanes on record after 13 of the storms reached hurricane status.",https://apnews.com/article/mexico-storms-hurricane-laura-hurricane-delta-hurricanes-c6c8503b057ab46d52bfc931d5b1766c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"The devastation caused by Hurricane Iota became clearer Wednesday as images emerged showing piles of wind-tossed lumber that used to be homes and concrete walls that were pounded into pieces by the second Category 4 storm to blast Nicaragua’s Caribbean coast in two weeks.
Nicaragua Vice President and first lady Rosario Murillo on Wednesday raised the nation’s death toll to 16. The victims were spread across the country, swept away by swollen rivers or buried in landslides.
Rescuers searched at the site of a landslide in northern Nicaragua, where the local government confirmed four deaths and neighbors spoke of at least 16. A short video from the nation’s emergency management agency showed a massive bowl-shaped mountainside shrouded in clouds that collapsed. Police blocked media access to the site on the Macizo de Pe?as Blancas, a mountain in Matagalpa province, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) north of Managua.
There were seven confirmed dead at the mountain, and the search continued, Murillo said.
Miguel Rodríguez, who works on a ranch next to the site, said he saw at least seven bodies.
“The landslide came with all the dirt, and it became like a river going down. It took all of the little houses that were there. There were five homes, five families,” Rodríguez said.

Typhoon,,"Powerful Hurricane Iota made landfall on Nicaragua’s Caribbean coast late Monday, threatening catastrophic damage to the same part of Central America already battered by equally strong Hurricane Eta less than two weeks ago.
Iota had intensified into an extremely dangerous Category 5 storm early in the day, but the U.S. National Hurricane Center said it weakened slightly to Category 4, with maximum sustained winds of 155 mph (250 kph). Its center made landfall about 30 miles (45 kilometers) south of the Nicaraguan city of Puerto Cabezas, also known as Bilwi.
Iota already had been hitting the Caribbean coasts of Nicaragua and Honduras with torrential rains and strong winds.
Iota came ashore just 15 miles (25 kilometers) south of where Hurricane Eta made landfall Nov. 3, also as a Category 4 storm. Eta’s torrential rains saturated the soil in the region, leaving it prone to new landslides and floods, and that the storm surge could reach 15 to 20 feet (4.5 to 6 meters) above normal tides.
In Bilwi, business owner Adán Artola Schultz braced himself in the doorway of his house as strong gusts of wind and rain drover water in torrents down the street. He watched in amazement as wind ripped away the metal roof structure from a substantial two-story home and blew it away like paper.
“It is like bullets,” he said of the sound of metal structures banging and buckling in the wind. “This is double destruction,” he said, referring to the damages wrought by Eta just 12 days earlier.
“This is coming in with fury,” said Artola Schultz.
Storm surge was on the mind of Yasmina Wriedt in Bilwi’s seaside El Muelle neighborhood.

Typhoon,,"Hundreds of people have been rescued after Hurricane Sally _ which has since transformed into a tropical storm _ made landfall in Alabama and Florida on Wednesday morning.
The storm arrived as a Category 2 hurricane in Gulf Shores, Alabama, around 4.45am with 105mph winds and rain depths in the feet, not inches, flooding homes and streets _ as people were forced to evacuate from the southern coast.
Some areas have already been hit with 24 inches of rain, and a total of 35 inches could come in parts of Florida and Alabama, according to the National Weather Service. Why specific areas were getting hammered with high rains was due, in part, to how slowly the storm was moving. It was traveling at just 7mph up the coastal states.
First responders used boats and high water vehicles in parts of Florida and Alabama to rescue hundreds of trapped residents while Hurricane Sally transformed into a tropical storm, with winds decreasing to 70mph.
The rescues came after some of the areas hit the hardest were not issued mandatory evacuations. Residents were encouraged to voluntarily leave, but some people still stayed behind in their homes.

The National Hurricane Center in Miami said Delta came ashore Friday evening in southwest Louisiana as a Category 2 hurricane but quickly weakened and has become a tropical storm as it moves inland.
The storm is moving to the north-northeast on a track across central and north Louisiana that is expected to continue through Saturday morning, forecasters said.
The National Hurricane Center in Miami said Delta came ashore Friday evening in southwest Louisiana as a Category 2 hurricane but quickly weakened and has become a tropical storm as it moves inland.
The storm is moving to the north-northeast on a track across central and north Louisiana that is expected to continue through Saturday morning, forecasters said.
The system is expected to become a tropical depression by later Saturday as it moves across northern Mississippi into the Tennessee Valley.
THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE: AP’s earlier story appears below.
Ripping tarps from already damaged roofs and scattering debris piled by roadsides, Hurricane Delta inflicted a new round of destruction on Louisiana as it struck communities still reeling after Hurricane Laura took a similar path just six weeks earlier.
Delta hit as a Category 2 hurricane, with top winds of 100 mph (155 kph) but rapidly grew weaker. It dwindled within hours to a weak Category 1 storm with 75 mph (120 kph) winds. Still, forecasters warned of danger from storm surge and flash floods across much of southwestern Louisiana and parts of neighboring Texas.
Delta made landfall Friday evening near the coastal town of Creole — a distance of only about 15 miles (24 kilometers) from where Laura struck land in August, killing 27 people in Louisiana. The earlier storm damaged nearly every home and building in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Piles of moldy mattresses, sawed-up trees and other debris still lined the streets.
Mayor Nic Hunter said tarps were flying off homes across the city.
“I’m in a building right now with a tarp on it and just the sound of the tarp flapping on the building sounds like someone pounding with a sledgehammer on top of the building,“ Hunter said as he rode out the storm downtown. ”It’s pretty intense.”
In Lake Charles, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland from where Delta came ashore, water leaked through the ceiling of Ernest Jack's bedroom as he tried to sleep Friday night. Jack said the tarp cover the roof damage caused by Laura hadn’t blown off. His windows were covered to protect against flying debris.
“It’s raining real hard; it’s flooding; the wind is strong,” Jack said Friday night. “I’m OK. I’m not worried about nothing, just praying that everything goes well.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/delta-inflicts-new-damage-on-stormweary-louisiana-delta-louisiana-track-depression-damage-b929354.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Typhoon,,"Louisiana on Sunday was picking up the pieces after Hurricane Delta swept through, wreaking havoc on a region already devastated by Hurricane Laura six weeks ago.
Two people were confirmed on Sunday to have been killed after Delta made landfall on Friday evening near the coastal town of Creole, with top winds of 100mph. 
Delta on Friday and Saturday moved over Lake Charles, a city where Hurricane Laura damaged nearly every home and building in late August.
Aerial photographs showed the destruction around Creole, with roofs torn from buildings and communities surrounded by floodwater.
John Bel Edwards, the governor of Louisiana, said the storm dumped more than 15 inches of rain on Lake Charles over two days, and more than 10 inches on Baton Rouge.
Edwards said 3,000 Louisiana National Guard soldiers were called up to clear roads and distribute meals and tarps.

“It’s hard to come back and see it again and then to know there’s another (hurricane) that’s out there,” Vincent, of Cameron told The Advertiser of Lafayette. “It’s tough.”
She said people leave with every hurricane that batters Louisiana's lightly populated southwest coast.
“Yeah, our house is still there, but do you know how lonely this place is going to be?” she said.
Coastal Cameron Parish had about 9,800 residents when Hurricane Rita hit in 2005. The next census, in 2010, found about 6,800 people in the parish, Louisiana's equivalent of a county elsewhere.
“I don’t know what’ll happen now, with these two storms,” said Scott Trahan, vice president of the parish police jury.
Hurricane Laura made landfall in Cameron on Aug. 27 and Delta came in Friday near Creole, just 13 miles (21 kilometers) to the east, where Trahan lives.
“Everywhere you look it's destruction around here,” he said in a phone interview Monday with The Associated Press. “Leave Cameron Parish and go into Calcasieu it's bad there too. You can run from the water but you can't run from the winds.”
The Army Corps of Engineers said Monday that it is still installing tarps on homes damaged by Hurricane Laura, and will check on and replace if needed those already installed and then hit by Delta in Allen, Beauregard, Calcasieu, Cameron, Jefferson Davis and Vernon parishes. “ALL eligible homeowners within the six affected parishes are eligible to sign-up for a FREE temporary roof ... through Oct. 24,” a news release said.

Although the weather system has now been downgraded, the Met Office has still issued a yellow warning for rain across western Scotland.
""Heavy and persistent rain” is expected across Scotland for much of the day, according to the Met Office.
Spray and flooding is expected to make driving much harder and journey times longer, and bus and train services will also be affected.
The first rains brought by the remnants of Hurricane Oscar will hit Northern Ireland on Friday afternoon, before the downpours and winds pick up early on Saturday morning for most of western Scotland and parts of north-western England.
By the end of Saturday the bad weather will have reached Wales and parts of eastern England as well, and BBC weather forecaster Nick Miller has warned that the winds could reach speeds of 60mph.

It has already been determined that it will be named Tropical Storm Florence as it gathers pace - becoming the seventh named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season.
The latest advisory for the storm — released at 7am Central time — said that the storm was 190 miles east-southeast of the southernmost point of those islands, and was moving at 12mph.

That said, tropical storm warnings remain in effect for Cabo Verde Islands Santiago, Fogo, and Brava, where residents can expect the potential for heavy rain and gusty winds later on in the day.

Typhoon,,"Another busy hurricane season appears likely, although it won’t be as bad as last year, according to a prediction released Wednesday by AccuWeather, a private weather forecasting service.
The prediction calls for seven to 10 hurricanes. Three to five of these are expected to reach major hurricane strength, which means winds of at least 111 mph.
“Current indications are this will be another above-normal season,” said Dan Kottlowski, AccuWeather’s lead hurricane forecaster. “This can translate into high impacts on the United States.”
The season still is unlikely to be as busy as last year’s record-breaking season, which generated 30 storms, including 13 hurricanes, subjecting the United States to 12 direct hits and exhausting the storm names selected for that year.
But the danger to the U.S. east coast may be higher this year because of the weakening of the Bermuda high, a high-pressure zone that last year stiff-armed many storms into the Gulf of Mexico. This year, the Bermuda high’s rim could be farther northeast, allowing storms to curve north earlier and strike the east coast.
The Accu-Weather forecast cited warm Atlantic temperatures as one factor in the prediction of an active season.
Hurricane season officially starts June 1, although there’s been discussion of shifting the date into May, since the past few years have produced several pre-season storms.",https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/weather/hurricane/fl-ne-accuweather-hurricane-season-forecast-20210331-ziup2islfndjbgiynrsmn43gja-story.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Typhoon,,"There has been a lull in tropical activity around the globe for the beginning of September, with most of the activity occurring in the Atlantic.

For now, the main focus is across the western North Pacific Ocean where a super typhoon has its eyes set for parts of South Korea and the Japanese island of Okinawa. The good news about Super Typhoon Sanba is that it will likely gradually weaken as it pushes to the north. However, the storm will likely pack a punch across South Korea.
Sanba, which was the 17th tropical depression to form in the western North Pacific Ocean developed on September 11, 2012. Within two days, Sanba hit ideal conditions to strengthen into a Category 5 hurricane, which we call a “Super Typhoon” in the western Pacific. “Super-typhoon” is a term utilized by the U.S. Joint Typhoon Warning Center for typhoons that reach maximum sustained 1-minute surface winds around 130 knots or 150 miles per hour. If you compare this to the Saffir-Simpson scale, it would be a very strong category 4 or 5 hurricane in the Atlantic basin. Yesterday, Sanba moved over very warm waters and was able to develop maximum sustained winds of 175 mph with gusts approximately around 200 mph. Just as a reference to give you an idea how strong Sanba truly is, an EF-4 tornado has sustained winds around 168-199 mph. Fortunately, systems that gain such a large increase in strength tend to weaken and undergoes an eye wall replacement cycle.

Typhoon,,"With one of the largest storms seen for years bearing down upon the Korean Peninsula, both Koreas have today warned of the potential for danger.
Chosun Central News Agency reported on the approach of ‘Typhoon Bolaven’ this afternoon, saying, “Typhoon-15 is now moving northwestward at a velocity of 12km/h, as of 09:00 Thursday.”
“It is expected to come to the sea off Shanghai, China on around August 27th and move northward along the west coastal area of Korea before reaching the Chinese northeastern region on the evening of August 28th. The typhoon-15 will trigger strong wind and heavy rains in overall areas of Korea on August 27th and 28th,” the brief report added.
According to South Korea’s meteorological authorities, meanwhile, Typhoon Bolaven was 460km south of Sogwipo, the largest city on the south coast of Jeju Island, at 12PM today, moving at 34km/h in a north-northwesterly direction. It appears set to make landfall over Hwanghae Province in North Korea late on the afternoon of the 28th.
With that particular region only just recovering from serious flooding, the typhoon is likely to be an unwelcome, and damaging, addition to what has been a difficult summer.",https://www.dailynk.com/english/typhoon-bolaven-bearing-down-on-ko/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Hurricane Hanna, the first hurricane of the season, makes landfall in Texas Hurricane Hanna, the first hurricane of the 2020 Atlantic tropical storm season, saw its sustained winds reaching 90mph before making landfall on the Texas coastline late yesterday. Post-landfall update towards the foot of this article. Hanna was a tropical storm on Friday and while it was expected to strengthen it was only given a low probability of reaching hurricane status. But hurricane Hanna defied some of the forecast models, to become the first hurricane of the 2020 Atlantic season on Saturday and intensify further as it moved towards the Texas coastline. Insurance, reinsurance and ILS market interests may have had a closer eye on tropical storm Gonzalo as yesterday forecasts suggested it could make it through the Caribbean, but now that storm is dissipating and hurricane Hanna has become the one to watch. Hurricane Hanna achieved sustained winds of 90mph with higher gusts to 110mph or more, as it moved slowly towards a landfall in Texas somewhere on the central Padre Island seashore. Hurricane Hanna could have strengthened further and the storms intensity was only limited by the amount of time it had over the warm Gulf waters. The modelled intensity forecast from TropicalTidbits.com showed a continued spike in wind speeds was expected up until landfall. The Texas coastal islands are already experiencing storm surge from hurricane Hanna, while the forecast is for coastal inundation totals of 2 to 6 feet above normal sea levels widely around the landfall region. Corelogic said in an update on hurricane Hanna that more than 14,000 residential properties lie in surge exposed areas near the area of the storms expected landfall. Significant rainfall totals are expected with hurricane Hanna, with the potential for isolated totals of 18 inches or perhaps more and life-threatening flash flood warnings raised for the southern Texas coastal region. Adding to the challenges, hurricane Hanna is coming ashore in a region of Texas where Covid-19 cases have been spiking in recent weeks, raising issues around distancing at evacuation centers should they be needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Hurricane Hanna makes landfall in Texas Hurricane Hanna battered southern Texas with sustained winds of 75 mph and continued to deliver heavy rain and flash flooding as it moved inland late Saturday. The Category 1 hurricane was moving west at about 8 mph when it made landfall at Padre Island, about 15 miles north of Port Mansfield, around 5 p.m. local time on Saturday. Very heavy rain, strong winds and storm surge impacted the south Texas coast, the worst of it south of Corpus Christi, down to the mouth of the Rio Grande River. While wind and storm surge were notable along the coast during the afternoon, very heavy rain and the potential for widespread flash flooding across the Rio Grande Valley was the biggest concern into Saturday night. Rainfall totals over extreme southern Texas to the Mexico border could lead to dangerous flash flooding. ""Any hurricane is an enormous challenge, this challenge is complicated and made even more severe seeing it is sweeping through an area that is the most challenged area in the state for COVID-19,"" said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. ""We cannot allow this hurricane to lead to a more deadly event by stoking COVID-19 leading to more fatalities."" Abbot said disaster declarations have been made in 32 counties. The National Weather Service in Brownsville reported ""significant structural damage"" in nearby Port Mansfield and a gust up to 83 mph. As is usually the case with land-falling tropical systems, isolated tornadoes are possible along the southern Texas coast through Saturday evening. Hanna will begin to rapidly weaken Saturday tonight and Sunday morning as it moves into northern Mexico. However, it will continue to bring widespread heavy rain and the threat of dangerous flash flooding across the Rio Grande Valley even as the wind speeds go down.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Typhoon,,"Hanna is expected to be a hurricane before it makes landfall in Texas Tropical Storm Hanna to bring flooding rain to Texas 01:09 (CNN)The earliest H-named storm ever in the Atlantic basin is gaining strength and forecast to make landfall as a hurricane in Texas on Saturday afternoon or evening. Tropical Storm Hanna is forecast to be a Category 1 hurricane with sustained winds of 75 mph when it makes landfall along the south-central coast of Texas, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida. ""Steady strengthening is forecast for the next 24 hours, and Hanna is expected to become a hurricane before the cyclone makes landfall,"" according to an advisory from the hurricane center. The storm currently has sustained winds of 65 mph that extend 60 miles out from the center as it moves across the Gulf of Mexico toward Texas. ""Storms like Hanna in the Gulf of Mexico are notoriously the hardest to forecast,"" CNN meteorologist Chad Myers says. ""The water is so warm under the storm that rapid intensification can happen at any time, especially overnight when atmospheric shear goes down naturally. "" Shear is the changing of wind speed and direction with height and can inhibit hurricanes from forming. If Hanna strengthens into a hurricane, it will be the first hurricane of the season in the Atlantic. As of 10 p.m. Friday, the storm was 165 miles (270 km) east-southeast of Corpus Christi, Texas. An eye is beginning to form based off radar imagery, the hurricane center said, which means the storm is better organized and developing a stronger core structure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Thousands of Texans remain without power in the aftermath of Hurricane Hanna Sign up for The Brief, our daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news. Two days after Hurricane Hanna touched down in South Texas, thousands remained without power and communities were grappling with how to deal with the damage caused by flooding and strong winds. The storm, which made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane Saturday evening at Padre Island, packed sustained winds as high as 90 mph before weakening into a tropical storm early Sunday and moving into northern Mexico. It was the first hurricane of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season. Hanna unleashed more than 15 inches of rain in parts of South Texas, resulting in serious flash flooding, according to The Washington Post. Gov. Greg Abbott warned Texans on Sunday that there are continued threats of flash flooding even as rainfall slows, due to overflowing rivers. ""Any additional rainfall will exacerbate these threats, but the State of Texas is ready to respond and protect our fellow Texans,"" he said in a statement. The Federal Emergency Management Agency and President Donald Trump approved a federal emergency declaration in response to Hanna, allowing for some federal assistance and reimbursement for evacuation efforts and shelter support. Abbott previously issued a disaster declaration for 32 counties. Downed power lines and trees have caused road closures across South Texas. As of 1 p.m. Monday, American Electric Power Texas, one of the state's largest electric providers, reported more than 58,000 power outages in Corpus Christi, Laredo and the Rio Grande Valley. Before Hanna made landfall, Corpus Christi Mayor Joe McComb told The Associated Press that the city was prepared to deal with both the pandemic and the hurricane. ""Don't feel like since we've been fighting COVID for five months that we're out of energy or we're out of gas,” he said. “We're not.

Typhoon,,"Deaths And Missing People Reported From Tropical Depression Hanna In Mexico As Hurricane Hanna barreled through the Atlantic Ocean this weekend, Texas and Mexico both braced for calamity, but it was Mexico that saw death. According to Mexican newspaper accounts, the bodies of a 7-year-old girl and her mother were found Monday in Saltillo, near Monterrey in northeastern Mexico, after the van they were in ran out of gas and was dragged down an overflowing tributary. They were swept away by the current. Some family members escaped, according to the Mexican papers, including the girl's 11-year-old sister, who reportedly managed to survive by clinging to branches. In the border city of Reynosa, one woman reportedly died after suffering a seizure and drowning in the floodwater left by Hanna. Three children were reported missing in a nearby neighborhood, after they fell from a tree into the water. Texas saw no casualties. After Hanna — the first hurricane of the season before being downgraded to a tropical storm, and then a tropical depression — hit the southwestern part of the state on Saturday, 200,000 locations were left without power. As of Monday morning, AEP Texas reported 60,000 outages remaining. Restoring power was complicated by severe flooding in some areas that limited access to substations, the utility said. Hanna made landfall about 90 miles south of Corpus Christi on Saturday evening, before moving into Mexico. In Texas, it dropped up to 15 inches of rain in some areas and caused extensive flooding and beach erosion. The Texas State Aquarium saw minor damage — mostly debris brought in by the storm surge. And the Bob Hall Pier, a local tourist destination, was damaged for the first time in its 37-year history. A video that circulated widely on social media over the weekend purported to show a section of the southern border wall crashing down in Hanna's high winds. But U.S. Customs and Border Protection told Texas Public Radio that the video appears to be from last month, when wind gusts knocked over several border wall panels at a construction site in New Mexico. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced Sunday that the Federal Emergency Management Agency and President Trump granted the state's request for emergency disaster relief. The state prepared for impact late last week, as hospitals in the area were already strained to near-capacity with coronavirus patients. Houston's deputy director for emergency management said Hurricane Hanna was a test of the state's ability to respond to disaster while trying to limit the spread of the coronavirus.

Typhoon,,"Tropical Storm Arthur forms in the Atlantic (CNN)Two weeks before the official start to Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Arthur has become the first named storm of the year -- but it's expected to brush the US coast before heading back out to sea. At 8 p.m. Sunday, Arthur's outer bands were skirting the North Carolina coast, the National Hurricane Center said. A tropical storm warning was in effect for Surf City north to Duck, an area that includes the Outer Banks barrier islands, meaning tropical storm conditions are expected sometime in the next 24 hours. Heavy rain, dangerous coastal surf conditions and rip currents are expected in the warning area, the hurricane center said. Arthur was about 260 miles south-southwest of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, moving toward the state at around 9 mph, the National Hurricane Center said in its 8 p.m. advisory. ""A turn toward the northeast with an increase in forward speed is forecast to occur later tonight or on Monday,"" the NHC said. ""A turn toward the east is expected on Tuesday."" The storm's center is forecast to stay ""well offshore of the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina"" Sunday night and move near or just east of the North Carolina coast on Monday, the hurricane center said.

Clouds and thunderstorms currently moving between the Florida Keys and Cuba are “likely” to develop into a tropical or subtropical depression this weekend in the Atlantic Ocean and then move northeastward, according to the National Hurricane Center, though it is too early to tell exactly what the full impact could be on the East Coast. Should the system develop and sustained winds reach at least 39 mph, it would be given the name Arthur. The Atlantic hurricane season doesn’t officially start until June 1.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Tropical Storm Arthur crawls closer to North Carolina coast Tropical Storm Arthur crawled closer to the North Carolina coast early Monday. The storm threatened some minor flooding and rough seas as the system moves off the Southeast seaboard. Arthur formed Saturday in waters off Florida, marking the sixth straight year that a named storm has developed before the official June 1 start of the Atlantic hurricane season. Tropical Storm Arthur crawled closer to the North Carolina coast early Monday, amid threats of some minor flooding and rough seas as the system moves off the Southeast seaboard. Arthur formed Saturday in waters off Florida, marking the sixth straight year that a named storm has developed before the official June 1 start of the Atlantic hurricane season. The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami issued a tropical storm warning for North Carolina’s Outer Banks on Sunday. At 2 a.m. EDT, the storm’s center was located about 185 miles (300 kilometers) south-southwest of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Arthur had top sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kph) and was moving to the north-northeast at 12 mph (19 kph). The hurricane center said Arthur is expected to move near or just east of the coast of North Carolina, where 1-3 inches of rain is expected, on Monday and they turn away from the East Coast on Monday night and Tuesday. By Sunday night, the storm’s swirling outer rain bands were skirting closer to the coast. A tropical storm warning was issued for parts of North Carolina’s coast, from Surf City to Duck, including Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds. Michael Lee, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Newport, North Carolina, said tropical-storm-force winds are possible along the coast, particularly in the Outer Banks. “Otherwise, it’s going to be some heavy rainfall for a large part of eastern North Carolina,” Lee said. “But the main threat that we’re really trying to get out there is that there is enhanced risk for dangerous rip currents both today and tomorrow. So, any folks who want to try to go to the beach and get in the water, we have a high risk out for most of our beaches.” The weather service said eastern North Carolina should prepare for some localized flooding and dangerous marine conditions along the coast. “Minor inundation from storm surge is possible for very low-lying areas adjacent to the ocean, sounds, and rivers, with overwash of dunes and flooding of properties and roadways possible for locations where dune structures are weak,” mainly north of Cape Lookout, the weather service said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Tropical Storm Arthur hits North Carolina coast with rain Tropical Storm Arthur moved out to sea Monday after dumping heavy rain on North Carolina as forecasters warned that the first named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season could continue to whip dangerous surf and rip currents for another day or more along the U.S. East Coast. The storm represented another early start for the Atlantic hurricane season. Arthur formed Saturday in waters off Florida, marking the sixth straight year that a named storm has developed before June 1. By late Monday, storm watches and warnings that had been in effect for parts of the North Carolina coast were canceled. As Arthur’s center passed off North Carolina earlier in the day, a pocket along the coast that includes Newport and Havelock recorded more than 4 inches (10 cm) of rain, according to the National Weather Service. Other areas along the coast saw 2 inches (5 cm) or more, causing some secondary roads to flood. Wind gusts of 40 mph or more (64 kph) were recorded in at least two places on the Outer Banks, the weather service said. The Hurricane Center said Arthur was moving northeast at 16 mph (26 kph) Monday afternoon as its center pulled away from the U.S. mainland. At 5 p.m. EDT, the storm’s center was located about 110 miles (175 kilometers) northeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Arthur had top sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph). Forecasters said Arthur could strengthen some as it moves away from land, but was likely to lose its tropical storm characteristics later Monday or Tuesday. North Carolina Emergency Management Director Mike Sprayberry said that over-wash or standing water had closed a highway on the Outer Banks and another on the mainland. Other secondary roads had flooded. Otherwise, he said conditions were stable and that no other serious problems had been reported to the state. Still, he warned that surf conditions will remain dangerous and advised people to be cautious around the water even as the storm pushes out to sea. “People in the eastern part of our state should remain cautious, especially while driving in areas where water may collect on roads,” he said at a news conference. “Today is not the day to take risks at the beach or in the surf.” Forecasters said rough surf could continue for another day or two. While other pre-June storms may be influenced by warming waters and climate change, Arthur is more of a subtropical system than a traditional named storm, said Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach, who added that its water is cooler than what’s usually needed for storm formation. A lot of these out-of-season storms are weak ones that meteorologists can detect because of satellites and other technology, but comparable storms would have been missed in an earlier era, Klotzbach said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tropical storm Arthur is forecast to come closest to the North Carolina coast around the Outer Banks, but then curve out into the Atlantic. Tropical storm Arthur currently has sustained winds of around 45 mph, with higher gusts, with tropical storm force winds extending out some 90 miles from the centre of the storm. The National Hurricane Center warns of tropical storm force winds for parts of the North Carolina coast, with how close Arthur eventually gets driving the strength of any wind gusts. In addition, rainfall of 1 to 3 inches is widely expected across parts of North Carolina, with isolated maximum amounts of 5 inches. Even if tropical storm Arthur came closer to shore, or made a landfall, it will not strengthen significantly before its closest pass to the North Carolina region it now seems. Arthur does not pose any real threat to insurance or reinsurance market interests at this time.

Updated 07:00 BTS Jun 3rd: Tropical storm Cristobal has formed out of a low pressure remnant that formed after a Pacific tropical storm named Amanda crossed over Central American country of Guatemala and crossed Mexico. Once the low pressure remnant emerged over the Bay of Campeche it became a tropical depression and then was soon upgraded to tropical storm Cristobal. Tropical storm Cristobal is currently packing 60 mph sustained winds and higher gusts, with minimum central pressure of 994 mb. Having spent recent hours circling close to the Mexican coastline, Cristobal has shifted southeast and is likely to make landfall crossing the southern Bay of Campeche coast later today. After a time inland, the forecast models show Cristobal moving back north and emerging back over the Bay of Campeche around Thursday night and into Friday. Forecast models then show Cristobal moving steadily north across the Gulf, which does mean it could be the first landfall threat to insurance and reinsurance market interests of the 2020 Atlantic storm season. The storm is now forecast to head slowly out into the Gulf of Mexico after meandering for a time near the shore, with strengthening likely and many forecast models are showing storm Cristobal heading towards the U.S. Gulf Coast and strengthening, with a slim chance currently of reaching hurricane status before its arrival. The immediate threat is severe rainfall to Mexico, with totals of 10 to 20 inches and isolated maximum amounts of 25 inches expected over parts of the Mexican states of Tabasco and Campeche. More broadly, 10 to 15 inches of rain is expected over parts of the Mexican states of Chiapas, Veracruz, Quintana Roo, Yucatan and Oaxaca, while rainfall of 10 to 15 inches, with isolated amounts of 25 inches, is expected along the Pacific coasts of Chiapas, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Some of these Pacific areas have already experienced up to 20 inches of rain, so ground is sodden and there is a risk of life-threatening flash floods and mudslides. After tropical storm Cristobal emerges back into the Gulf there remains significant uncertainty over how well organised it will be and whether it will make it to the U.S., the probability appears to have declined overnight. Many forecast models continue to point towards a more central Gulf Coast landfall scenario, but there is still significant uncertainty and range in the forecast path for Cristobal, as well as in terms of potential intensity.

Typhoon,,"Cristobal becomes the earliest third Atlantic named storm on record (CNN)The 2020 hurricane season is only two days old and is already an active one. Cristobal is now the third named storm of the season. It's the earliest a third named storm has ever formed. 2020 Atlantic Hurricane Season Facts >>> Right now Cristobal is a tropical storm with sustained winds of 40 mph with higher gusts. It is moving to the southwest at 3 mph. On its current track, it is expected to continue to interact with southern Mexico over the next several days. The main risk for this storm will continue to be rain. Ten to 20 inches of rain is possible across the Mexican states of Tabasco, Veracrus and Campeche. There could be isolated amounts of more than 2 feet of rain. Some of the Pacific locations in southern Mexico received 20 inches of rain over the weekend, and could get an additional foot of rain. According to the National Hurricane Center, ""Rainfall in all of these areas may produce life-threatening flash floods and mudslides."" ""The Bay of Campeche is notoriously the warmest part of the Gulf region this time of year,"" said CNN Meteorologist Chad Myers. In fact, sea surface temperatures for this area are running 3-4 degrees Fahrenheit above normal right now, providing a lot of fuel for the storm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tropical Storm Cristobal was spinning in the Bay of Campeche at midday Tuesday. By the end of the week, the system is expected to slowly intensify in the Gulf of Mexico, with some data suggesting the storm could ultimately approach or even make a U.S. landfall. Tropical storm warnings are already up in Mexico from Campeche to Puerto de Veracruz as the system continues to organize, while there is concern closer to home for possible impacts by the weekend, depending on the storm’s track and intensity. The system was declared a “tropical depression” on Monday evening and upgraded to a tropical storm at 12:30 p.m. Eastern. This is the earliest third-named storm to form in the Atlantic basin, with the previous record being Tropical Storm Colin, which formed on June 5, 2016. The jury is out as to how exactly the storm will evolve. In fact, there’s even an outside chance that two named storms brew in the Gulf.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Tropical Storm Cristobal brings heavy rain and flooding to southern US Tropical Storm Cristobal made landfall on Louisiana’s coastline on Sunday 7 June, but the impacts of the storm were felt far and wide. Rainfall rates of 152.4mm an hour were recorded in Florida resulting in flash flooding destroying cars, as well as a tornado forming in downtown Orlando. Prior to landfall on US soil, Cristobal brought destruction along the Gulf of Mexico, with nearly 328.9mm of rain falling in a 24-hour period causing significant flooding, cutting off communities, and triggering landslides. Cristobal is the third named storm of an already busy Atlantic hurricane season. The start of the monsoon season was officially announced last week in Kerala, India, where favourable conditions for the south-west monsoon have developed. The monsoon season is critical for the agricultural sector, which accounts for approximately 15% India’s economy, playing a vital role in crop irrigation. However, heavy monsoon rains can be hazardous too, bringing the threat of landslides and flash flooding, frequently resulting in the loss of life. In the central Netherlands, three waterspouts developed over Markermeer Lake, near Lelystad, on Friday. These waterspouts formed as a series of heavy showers passed over the region from the east, these showers later developing into a thunderstorm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now, Cristobal is heading into Canada as an extra-tropical storm, bringing widespread thunderstorms to the Great Lakes region. ""As the remnants of Cristobal lifts very quickly to the north, the system will bring strong severe storms to portions of the Great Lakes, more specifically Michigan and Ohio this afternoon,"" CNN meteorologist Haley Brink says. ""Due to the speed of this system, severe damaging winds may be the more widespread threat through the afternoon and evening hours, with tornadoes also possible.""

Tropical storm Fay formed off the North Carolina coast on July 9th and headed north, with the storm gaining structure and wind speed strength to become a strong tropical storm with sustained winds of around 60mph before it headed for a landfall in the northeast U.S. on July 10th. Tropical storm Fay made landfall just north of Atlantic City, New Jersey, and continued north through New York, with its sustained winds weakening as it passed through this area of particularly high insurance and reinsurance market exposure. KCC explained that parts of Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York all saw damaging winds from tropical storm Fay. Some power outages were reported in New York and New Jersey, although these were largely quickly resolved. The most likely impacts from tropical storm Fay are light wind damage, but some structural damage is possible from trees falling on buildings, KCC said. The catastrophe risk modeller highlighted that in New York City alone hundreds of downed trees were reported, while parts of New Jersey and Pennsylvania, among other areas, also experienced tree damage that resulted in infrastructure disruption. Low levels of storm surge were also seen along a swathe of the U.S. eastern seaboard from South Carolina to New York. Having run its catastrophe risk model, KCC believes that tropical storm Fay will result in an estimated close to $400 million of losses that fall to the insurance market. At that low-level losses to reinsurance capital would be expected to be minimal. KCC said its estimate includes privately insured wind and storm surge damage to residential, commercial and industrial properties, as well as automobiles.

Typhoon,,"NASA sees record-breaking new Tropical Storm Gonzalo strengthening The seventh named tropical cyclone of the North Atlantic Ocean has formed, and like some others this season, it has broken a record. NASA's Aqua satellite provided a look at the small record-breaker. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) reports that Gonzalo is the earliest seventh named storm on record in the Atlantic basin, beating Gert of 2005 by 2 days. Tropical Depression Seven formed on July 21 by 5 p.m. EDT in the Central North Atlantic Ocean, and by 8:50 a.m. EDT on July 22 it strengthened into a tropical storm and was renamed Gonzalo. One of the ways NASA researches tropical cyclones is using infrared data that provides temperature information. The AIRS instrument aboard NASA's Aqua satellite captured a look at those temperatures in Gonzalo and gave insight into the size of the storm and its rainfall potential. Cloud top temperatures provide information to forecasters about where the strongest storms are located within a tropical cyclone. Tropical cyclones do not always have uniform strength, and some sides have stronger sides than others. The stronger the storms, the higher they extend into the troposphere, and the colder the cloud temperatures. NASA provides that data to forecasters at NOAA's National Hurricane Center or NHC so they can incorporate it in their forecasting. On July 22 at 12:11 a.m. EDT (0411 UTC) NASA's Aqua satellite analyzed the storm using the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder or AIRS instrument. AIRS found coldest cloud top temperatures as cold as or colder than minus 63 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 53 degrees Celsius).

Forecast track of Typhoon ""Yolanda"" as of 2 a.m., 08 November 2013. Image from PAGASA
PAGASA said Yolanda is forecast to move west northwest at 39 kph. After hitting Guiuan, it is expected to traverse the provinces of Biliran, the northern tip of Cebu, Iloilo, Capiz, Aklan, Romblon, Semirara Island, southern part of Mindoro and then Busuanga.
Yolanda is expected to exit Philippine landmass on Saturday morning, moving towards the West Philippine Sea.
An estimated rainfall amount of 10 to 30 millimeters per hour (heavy - intense) is expected within the typhoon's 400-km diameter.
Sea travel is risky over the seaboards of Northern Luzon and the eastern seaboard of Central Luzon.
Residents in low lying and mountainous areas under signal nos. 4, 3 and 2 are alerted against possible flash floods and landslides. Likewise, those living in coastal areas under signal nos. 4, 3 and 2 are alerted against storm surges which may produce waves with height of at least 7 meters.
Storm surge warning
The Department of Science and Technology's Project NOAH (Nationwide Operational Assessment of Hazards) said areas in the path of the typhoon could experience tidal and storm-induced waves that could reach as high as 17 feet.
Project NOAH said Ormoc, Leyte could experience waves as high as 5.2 meters (17 feet), with its peak occurring at 2 p.m. today.
Other areas that will see seawater rise above more than 4 meters (13 feet) because of typhoon Yolanda include Matarinao Bay, Eastern Samar (4.7 meters); Port Pusgo, Quezon (4.6 meters); Santa Cruz Harbor, Quezon (4.3 meters); Poro Island, Biliran (4.3 meters); Banate, Iloilo (4.1 meters); and Port Barton, Palawan (4 meters).
An estimated 17 million people are forecast to be affected by cyclone-strength winds brought by the typhoon.
The Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System (GDACS), a cooperation framework between the United Nations, the European Commission and disaster managers worldwide to improve alerts, said 14.2 million people may be affected by Category 1 (120 kilometers per hour) wind speeds.
In an advisory issued at 5 a.m. on Friday (Manila time), GDACS said Yolanda was already packing 315 kph maximum sustained winds.
Massive evacuation
President Benigno Aquino had on Thursday warned his countrymen to make all possible preparations for Haiyan, which was packing monster wind gusts of nearly 380 kilometers (235 miles) an hour as it approached the Philippines.
""To our local officials, your constituents are facing a serious peril. Let us do all we can while (Haiyan) has not yet hit land,"" Aquino said in a nationally televised address.
""We can minimize the effects of this typhoon if we help each other. Let us remain calm, especially in buying our primary needs, and in moving to safer places.""
Aquino warned areas within the expected 600-kilometer typhoon front would be exposed to severe flooding as well as devastating winds, while coastal areas may see waves six meters (20 feet) high.
More than 125,000 people in the most vulnerable areas had been moved to evacuation centers before Haiyan hit, according to the civil defense office, and millions of others braced for the typhoon in their homes.
Authorities said schools in the storm's path were closed, ferry services suspended and fishermen ordered to secure their vessels.
In the capital of Manila, which was not directly in the typhoon's path but still expected to feel some of its impact, many schools were also closed.
Philippine Airlines, Cebu Pacific and other carriers announced the suspension of hundreds of flights, mostly domestic but also some international.
Cajulis said Haiyan was travelling quickly, at 39 kilometers an hour, and would travel across the country towards the South China Sea throughout Friday.
There were no immediate reports of casualties.
State weather forecaster Glaize Escullar said on Thursday Haiyan was expected to hit areas still recovering from a devastating storm in 2011 and from a 7.1-magnitude quake last month.
They include the central island of Bohol, the epicenter of the earthquake that killed 222 people, where at least 5,000 survivors are still living in tents while waiting for new homes.
Other vulnerable areas are the port cities of Cagayan de Oro and Iligan on the southern island of Mindanao, where flash floods induced by Tropical Storm Washi killed more than 1,000 people in December 2011.
Haiyan had maximum sustained winds on Friday morning of 315 kilometers an hour, and gusts of 379 kilometers an hour, according to the US Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Center.
The Philippine state weather service, which typically gives lower wind readings, said the maximum gusts on Friday morning were 275 kilometers an hour.
But even that reading would still make Haiyan the world's strongest typhoon this year, according to David Michael Padua, a meteorologist with the Weather Philippines Foundation, a storm monitoring organisation that runs the www.weather.com.ph website.
""The wind speeds of this extremely catastrophic cyclone has increased further to 315 km/hr, making it the most powerful typhoon ever observed since Super Typhoon Tip of 1979,"" Padua said.
The Philippines is battered by an average of 20 major storms or typhoons each year, many of them deadly, but scientists have said climate change may be increasing their ferocity and frequency.

Typhoon,haiyan,"At least 10,000 people are thought to have died in the central Philippine province of Leyte after_yphoon Haiyan, one of the strongest storms ever to make landfall, lashed the area, swallowing coastal towns, a senior police official said early on Sunday morning.
About 70-80% of the buildings in the area in the path of Haiyan in Leyte province was destroyed, said chief superintendent Elmer Soria. ""We had a meeting last night with the governor and the other officials. The governor said based on their estimate, 10,000 died,"" he said.
Tacloban city administrator Tecson Lim said that the death toll in that city alone ""could go up to 10,000"". Tacloban is the provincial capital of Leyte, with a population of more than 200,000. The Philippine Red Cross said in Tacloban bodies had been found ""piled up around the roads"" and in churches. Between 300 and 400 bodies had been recovered, Lim said.
On Samar island, which faces Tacloban, Leo Dacaynos of the provincial disaster office told Associated Press on Sunday 300 people were confirmed dead in Basey town and another 2,000 were missing.
He said the storm surge caused sea waters to rise 20 feet when the typhoon hit. There were still towns on Samar that had not been reached, he said, and appealed for food and water. Power was knocked out and there was no mobile signal, making communication possible only by radio.
Many corpses hung on tree branches, buildings and sidewalks, Associated Press reported.
""On the way to the airport we saw many bodies along the street,"" said Philippine-born Australian Mila Ward, 53, who was waiting at the Tacloban airport to catch a military flight back to Manila.
""They were covered with just anything tarpaulin, roofing sheets, cardboards,"" she said. Asked how many, she said, ""Well over 100 where we passed.""
The super-typhoon made landfall on Samar and Leyte islands in the eastern Visayas at about 4.40am on Friday local time, with winds up to 315km/h (195mph) tearing roofs off buildings, turning roads into rivers full of debris and knocking out electricity pylons.
With many provinces left without power or telecommunications, and airports in the hardest-hit areas, such as Tacloban, in tatters, experts say it is impossible to know the extent of the storm's damage _ or deliver badly needed aid.
Roughly 12 hours after the 600km (370-mile)-wide Haiyan blew west towards Vietnam, where it is expected to make landfall early on Sunday, officials and aid workers are only now beginning to piece together details on the number of dead and injured.
Government figures showed that more than 4 million had been directly affected. The World Food Programme has mobilised some $2m (£1.25m) in aid and aims to deliver 40 tonnes of fortified biscuits to victims within the next few days.
Satellite images show normally green patches of vegetation ripped up into brown squares of debris in Tacloban, where local TV channel GMA broadcast images of huge storm surges, flattened buildings and families traipsing through flooded streets with their possessions held high above the water.
The head of the UN Disaster Assessment Co-ordination Team, Sebastian Rhodes Stampa, described ""destruction on a massive scale"" in the city of 220,000 and said: ""The last time I saw something of this scale was in the aftermath of the Indian Ocean tsunami. There are cars thrown like tumbleweed and the streets are strewn with debris.""
Al-Jazeera correspondent Jamela Alindogan was trapped in her hotel as the eye of the storm passed overhead and ripped the roof off the building. Evoking scenes of chaos as badly hurt victims wandered the streets without medicine, food or water, and doctors at the local hospital attended to the wounded in the dark without electricity or candlelight, she said: ""There is no food, not even in the hotels, and there's no water. The situation is really very desperate.""
Other sources told of victims trying to climb out from under rubble to find assistance, and mobs rampaging through the streets looking for food, water or medicine, and looting electrical goods and groceries from malls. ""Almost all the houses were destroyed,"" said Major Rey Balido of the_hilippines_ational disaster agency. ""Only a few are left standing.""
Relatives of those living in the typhoon's path have had no news from their loved ones and are nervously waiting until power is restored to the area. ""I spoke to my mother just a few hours before the typhoon made landfall in my city, Tacloban,"" said taxi driver Sherwin Martinata, 32, in the capital, Manila. ""She was saying she was all right but now I have no idea if my family is safe. There is no power, no phones. I can't get through at all. I'm worried, but I'm powerless.""
Those living in the hardest-hit areas, such as the eastern Visayas, are among the poorest in the Philippines, say aid agencies, who warn that there will be little or no savings for many of the victims to fall back on _ putting an already vulnerable population at even greater risk of future food and job insecurity.
On Bohol island _ where a 7.3-magnitude earthquake toppled colonial-era churches and killed some 200 people last month _ residents were successfully evacuated ahead of the storm and as a result many lives were probably saved, said Mathias Eick of the European commission's humanitarian aid department (Echo). However, because the island's main power supply comes from neighbouring Leyte, residents are still without electricity or water.
In Tacloban, where many residents live along the coast, the sheer force of the storm was just too much for the buildings to withstand, with evacuation centres such as stadiums and churches later collapsing. ""The sheer magnitude and scale of the disaster sort of overpowered all the contingency measures, and we're fearing that we'll be finding more dead bodies in those evacuation centres themselves,"" said Alwynn Javier of Christian Aid.
Without information on the ground or access to hard-hit areas, aid agencies have been stuck, not knowing how much aid is needed or which areas need it most.
""The only information we have been able to get so far is from the UN and some from the news,"" said Javier. ""We should have good ground reach, but are really impeded by this lack of access because even our partners on the ground have been hit themselves.""
Officials and rescue workers hoped that Sunday would see concerted efforts by authorities to set up command centres and rescue groups, which will in turn help bring supplies to those who need them most. But gaining access to those areas will prove hard, said Richard Gordon of the Philippine Red Cross, who added that without bulldozers or tractors to clear paths, volunteers will have to bring cutting equipment to clear uprooted trees and debris.
The Philippines sees roughly 20 typhoons every year, with some more devastating than others. Last year's Typhoon Bopha killed more than 1,100 people and caused over $1bn in damage.
Haiyan _ the 25th typhoon to hit the Philippines this year _ is expected to make landfall in several provinces in central Vietnam with winds around 220km/h (137mph). More than 450,000 troops have been deployed, as well as 12 planes, 356 ships and thousands of vehicles, in order to mobilise supplies, with more than 300,000 people evacuated in Da Nang and Quang Ngai provinces.
""It may be the strongest storm to hit Vietnam in history,"" said Vietnam's director of the Central Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting Centre in Bui Minh Tang. Coastal areas should expect to see waves as high as 5-8 meters (16-26ft) and a wind radius up to 500km wide, officials warned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Experts say Typhoon Haiyan was about as strong as it could theoretically get when it swept through the Philippines, killing thousands of people and driving hundreds of thousands from their homes. But intensity limits have been rising over decades past — and climate models suggest they will keep rising over the decades to come, with the potential for bigger and more devastating storms.
""The tragedy of this particular storm is that it reached its limit just about the time it made landfall,"" Kerry Emanuel, a climate scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told NBC News.
Based on satellite imagery, the U.S. military's Joint Typhoon Warning Center estimated that Haiyan's winds reached a sustained peak as high as 195 mph shortly before it made landfall, with gusts rising to 235 mph. Estimates from Philippine weather officials were lower, suggesting that the storm packed sustained winds of 147 mph and gusts of 170 mph when it hit land. Either way, the typhoon ranks among the world's strongest tropical storms and appears to have been more powerful than Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
If the higher estimates are correct, the warning center said Haiyan's maximum strength would exceed that of its previous record-holder: Hurricane Camille, which hit the northern Gulf Coast in 1969 with sustained winds of 190 mph.
""This is at the top end of any tropical system that we've seen on our planet,"" said Bryan Norcross, The Weather Channel's hurricane specialist.
The definition of that top end has been shifting, Emanuel said. He was part of a team of researchers who predicted climate change could make tropical storms more intense, particularly in the Pacific.
""That part of the ocean, the Western Pacific, in November is pretty juicy,"" he said. ""It has a high thermodynamic limit. That limit has been going up in time, perhaps in response to global warming. It's a little hard to say that for sure."" 
Although the maximum intensity of tropical storms is projected to rise, the climate models suggest a scenario that's more complex than merely turning up the dials. ""It doesn't mean there'll be more storms,"" Emanuel said. ""In fact, the weaker storms might be less frequent, but it's not the weaker storms that do the damage. In the end, we're much more concerned about what happens at the high end. It's those guys that do all the terrible destruction.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Super Typhoon Haiyan smashed into the central island of Samar early on Friday morning, packing sustained winds of up to 315 kilometres per hour.
At least three people have been killed and seven injured, the government said.
Communications and power are down in several provinces, and authorities are still trying to make contact with some of the worst-hit areas.
There's particular concern about the city of Guiuan, with a population of 47,000, which was the first in line when Haiyan made landfall.
The typhoon has brought down power lines and trees, and destroyed crops, buildings and houses.
Amateur video has shown flooded streets caused both by heavy rain and a storm surge that was predicted to be as high as to seven metres.
Sea travel and flights have been suspended, and schools have been closed in the central region.
Rescue agencies say they are struggling to assess the full extent of the damage as the storm continues to batter the country.
The head of the Philippines Red Cross, Gwendolyn Pang, has told Asia Pacific even those who have sought emergency shelter are still at risk.
""Even people in evacuation centres - we are not quite sure if they're safe because the wind is very strong,"" she said.
""We have seen in the previous disasters - especially typhoons - still evacuation centres are not really safe for the people.
""We're trying our best to continue to monitor the situation...but it's so huge - so big.""
Ms Pang says the wind is making any aid efforts difficult.
""The challenge now is how are we going to continue to support the people in the next few hours or days because...our the wind is very strong and our activities are very limited at the moment,"" she said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The_ropical cyclone_roduced high_inds, coastal storm surges, heavy rains, and_looding_n the land areas over which it passed. By far the worst-hit region was the central Philippines, where the storm produced widespread devastation and killed thousands of people. Many considered it to be the country’s worst natural disaster. With maximum sustained winds at landfall there that measured 195 miles (314 km) per hour, Haiyan was among the most powerful tropical cyclones ever recorded, if not the most powerful, to strike land.
The typhoon began as an area of_onvection_ocated in the equatorial Pacific Ocean some 230 nautical miles (425 km) east-southeast of_ohnpei_n November 2. Later that day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) at_earl Harbor,_awaii, reclassified the disturbance as a tropical depression, naming the storm Tropical Depression 31W. The system traveled westward across the tropical Pacific Ocean over the next few days, growing in size and strength. The Japan Meteorological Agency reclassified the phenomenon as a_ropical storm_t midnight_reenwich Mean Time(GMT) on November 4 and assigned the name Haiyan, after its winds had reached a measured speed of 40 miles (64 km) per hour. With winds increasing to 75 miles (120 km) per hour sometime during the early afternoon on November 5, Haiyan had become a typhoon.
The storm continued to increase in intensity, and the JTWC upgraded Haiyan to a super typhoon (equivalent to a strong category 4 or category 5 hurricane, with maximum sustained one-minute surface winds of at least 150 miles [241 km] per hour) at 2:45_M_MT (10:45_M_ocal time) on November 6. At that moment Haiyan was located some 113 nautical miles (209 km) east-northeast of Palau and was moving westward at about 21 miles (about 34 km) per hour. Later in the day, the storm swelled to more than 500 miles (about 800 km) in diameter with a 9-mile- (14.5-km-) wide eye. Early in the morning of November 7, the storm’s eye wall passed over Palau’s Kayangel Islands with winds that, according to some reports, approached 155 miles (250 km) per hour. Haiyan’s winds continued to increase through the day, rising to 195 miles (314 km) per hour with gusts measured at 235 miles (378 km) per hour.
Haiyan made landfall in the Philippines at the city of Guiuan on the island of_amar_t 4:40_M_ocal time on November 8.

Typhoon,,"Strong hurricanes could hit Asia and the U.S. East Coast more often this century, a new study finds.
The research adds to a growing body of evidence that hurricanes are becoming more intense as global warming heats the oceans. This means Category 1, 2 and 3 storms will have fiercer winds, bumping them up to Category 3, 4 and higher. Overall, the study's modeling approach predicts a 40 percent global increase in tropical cyclones of Category 3 and higher during the 21st century.
The findings were published in Monday's issue of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
The new study also projects that these strong storms will become more frequent in the North Pacific, the North Atlantic and the South Indian Oceans.
""We see an increase, in particular, toward the middle of the century,"" said Kerry Emanuel, study author and an MIT climatologist. ""The results surprised us, but we haven't gotten so far as to understand why this is happening.""
Scientists actively debate whether tropical cyclones (the broad name for hurricanes, typhoons and tropical storms) will become more frequent, more intense or both as a result of climate change. Global warming has heated the oceans along with the atmosphere, and sea-surface temperature is one of the most important influences on hurricane strength. But other factors — such as climate cycles, like the El Ni_o Southern Oscillation, and interactions with other storms, which can weaken or strengthen storms — also alter tropical storm strength. Hurricanes are also marvelous heat transporters, affecting climate by moving energy around the planet. [Hurricanes from Above: See Nature's Biggest Storms]
""For scientists, this is far from a solved problem,"" said Emanuel, who has been a main participant in the debates on the future of hurricanes. ""The main message is, we have to continue to regard there being a not-trivial risk of increasing problems from tropical cyclones because of climate change.""
How global warming fuels hurricanes
Hurricanes feed off warm ocean water. In the ocean's hurricane nurseries, heat rising from the ocean turns into water vapor. As the vapor rises and cools, it condenses into rain. This releases heat, which helps strengthen circulating tropical cyclones. Warmer oceans mean more water vapor, and more intense storms.
Emanuel relies on a technique called downscaling to estimate how future climate change will shift hurricane strength and frequency. In the new study, he used the latest global climate models, called CMIP5, which project future climate change but are too coarse to resolve ""small"" features, such as hurricanes. Emanuel ran the models at higher-resolution and randomly generated disturbances similar to tropical cyclones, and then used a theoretical model to predict how strong the storms would become. Emanuel first presented this approach, with an earlier version of the CMIP models (CMIP3), in a 2008 paper in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.
One limitation of relying on global climate models to predict future hurricanes is that these models do not capture the past decade's climate variability, such as relatively stable temperatures between 1998 and 2008, said Peter Webster, a climatologist at Georgia Tech who was not involved in the study. (The hiatus is attributed to natural variability in Earth's climate system, superimposed on the longer-term warming trend.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"“The United Nations agencies in the Philippines, with their humanitarian partners, are supporting the Government and other responders in their efforts to assess the situation and respond rapidly with vital supplies, through the coordination system led by the local authorities,” said Emergency Relief Coordinator Valerie Amos.
This morning, the UN Disaster Coordination Team (UNDAC) arrived in the city of Tacloban, one of the most affected areas, and reported scenes of total devastation, with all roads from the airport to the town blocked. The UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Food Programme (WFP) have also mobilized their in-country teams to reach those affected.
The Philippines Red Cross said it has received reports of 1,200 deaths in two areas hit by the typhoon, a drastic increase from the three reported yesterday.
“Sadly, it is likely that this figure will rise,” Ms. Amos said. ""The Government estimates that some 4.3 million people are affected, across 36 provinces, and initial assessments show that thousands of homes have been destroyed, roads are impassable and people need food, water, shelter and power.”
According to UNICEF, up to 1.7 million children could be affected by Haiyan. The agency has already mobilized its staff to deliver pre-positioned emergency supplies, and is flying in some 60 metric tonnes of additional supplies from Copenhagen, including medical and shelter equipment. They are expected to arrive within the next three days.
“UNICEF's first priorities are focused on life-saving interventions _ getting essential medicines, nutrition supplies, safe water and hygiene supplies to children and families,” said UNICEF's representative in the Philippines, Tomoo Hozumi.
In addition, the World Food Programme (WFP) has mobilized $2 million for the response, and will be appealing for more funds as the needs become clearer. As a preliminary measure, 40 metric tonnes of high-energy biscuits will be flown in from Dubai in the coming days. These are often provided in the early days of a crisis as they are light to transport and do not need cooking. WFP is also looking at other food commodities to stabilize the nutrition situation.
“The devastation we saw in Tacloban today was shocking,” said WFP Representative and Country Director Praveen Agrawal. “People have lost their homes and livelihoods, and the damage to infrastructure is substantial.""
In a statement issued by his spokesperson, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he was deeply saddened by the extensive loss of life and the serious damage to the infrastructure of the country.
“The Secretary-General offers his sincere condolences to the people and Government of the Philippines, particularly to those who have lost family members, their homes or have been otherwise affected by this disaster,” the statement said.
Haiyan, known locally as Yolanda, is one of the strongest storms ever recorded, hitting landfall with sustained winds of 295 kilometres per hour (kph), placing it above the 252 (kph) threshold for a Category 5 hurricane, the highest category on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. The typhoon is expected to hit Viet Nam later today.
Haiyan is the third major crisis to hit the Philippines in just two months. In October, the Bohol earthquake affected more than 3 million people, triggering landslides engulfing entire homes, ripping apart bridges and tearing down centuries-old churches. Seven cities in three different provinces were initially affected. In September, tens of thousands were forcibly displaced by armed clashes in Zamboanga City in the southern part of the country.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Typhoon Haiyan has made landfall in Vietnam, days after leaving thousands feared dead and widespread devastation in the Philippines, meteorologists confirm.
The national weather forecaster said Haiyan made landfall in northern province of Quang Ninh at5:00am local time_n Monday (22:00 GMT on Sunday)_s a tropical storm. It was moving towards southern China and is expected to weaken to a low depression later on Monday.
Downpours hit the capital, Hanoi, and houses in some northern provinces were damaged by strong winds.
“Several hundred houses had their roofs ripped off. Thousands of trees in the province were uprooted,” said Nguyen Cong Thuan, a disaster official in Quang Ninh province.
“Three people were reported missing,” he added.
National disaster officials said no deaths had been reported so far on Monday, although state media said five people had died during preparations for the typhoon.
Haiyan has weakened significantly since scything through the Philippines at the weekend, and had sustained winds of 120km per hour as it hit Vietnam. That was down from winds of over 300km per hour when the storm hit the Philippines, devastating Leyte and Samar provinces, as well as other areas.
More than 600,000 Vietnamese were evacuated from their homes at the weekend as Haiyan bore down on Vietnam.
The storm changed course on Sunday, prompting further mass evacuations of about 52,000 people in northern provinces by the coast.
“People must bring enough food and necessities for three days. Those who do not move voluntarily will be forced,” online newspaper_NExpress_aid, adding all boats have been ordered back to shore.
All schools were ordered shut in the capital Monday and extra police were dispatched to redirect traffic in flood-prone areas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Just three weeks after a powerful earthquake shook the central area of the Philippines, the country has been hit by on of the most dangerous storms ever recorded. Typhoon Haiyan, known locally as Yolanda, made landfall on Friday with winds of around 300km/h and the diameter of up to 400 km, causing heavy rainfalls, flash floods and landslides. Despite preparedness measures taken by the national authorities devastation is vast, millions of people have been affected and the death toll is expected to be substantial. A team of ECHO humanitarian experts has been deployed on the ground and is conducting a rapid needs assessment with partner organisations. The European Commission stands ready to assist.
The Emergency Response and Coordination Centre (ERCC) of the European Commission's Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department ECHO is closely monitoring the situation. Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) reached the equivalent of a Hurricane Category 5 during its quick passage through the archipelago and is now heading towards Vietnam. Nearly 800 000 residents on the potentially affected areas were pre-emptively evacuated, including survivors of the island communities struck by the 7.2 magnitude earthquake on 15 October, who were staying in tent shelters, but humanitarian impact has nevertheless been high. Access to affected areas remains difficult, with power and telecommunications shutdowns in most of them as well.
The Philippines is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world, with 15 to 20 cyclones a year and major seismic upheavals, among other natural catastrophes. The European Commission has provided _42.7 million in disaster relief since 1997 and almost _8 million in preparedness. In 2013 alone, _2.5 million were made available for the response to the earthquake in Bohol, a total of _10 million were released to help rebuild the communities stricken in December 2012 by Typhoon Bopha (Pablo), and following flooding caused by Typhoon Trami (Maring) in August ECHO committed _200 000 to assist those affected.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"A senior U.N. humanitarian official said Monday that nearly 10 million people in the Philippines have been affected by the massive typhoon that ravaged the country on Friday.
John Ging, operations director of the U.N.’s humanitarian office, told reporters that 9.8 million people have been affected and 660,000 displaced from what he said was the biggest typhoon recorded in nearly a century.
Ging said the devastation wa huge and the U.N. was mobilizing for a massive response.
“We, in the United Nations and with our international NGO partners, are very much in support and we are focused on - as you would expect -- first and foremost, on the requirements for food, the requirements for shelter support, the requirements for medical support, to prevent the outbreak of public health disasters with so many people - estimated now over 10,000 people perished,” he said.
Ging expressed hope that the death toll would not go higher, but said everyone must be prepared for the worst as responders reach remote areas.
He commended the Philippine authorities, who he said were responding in a “very impressive” way.
Ging said efforts to reach those in need were complicated by logistical constraints, including damage to infrastructure, roads and airports.
U.N. Humanitarian chief Valerie Amos is on her way to the Philippines where she will launch an appeal for funds on Tuesday. In the meantime, the U.N. has released $25 million from its Central Emergency Relief Fund to assist aid agencies in quickly mobilizing relief efforts.

Typhoon,,"American forces were dispatched to the Philippines as the Pacific island country struggled to cope Sunday after one of the most powerful storms in recorded history killed thousands — possibly as many as 10,000 — and wreaked damage far worse than expected.
“At the request of the government of Philippines, Secretary Hagel has directed U.S. Pacific Command to support U.S. government humanitarian relief operations in the Philippines in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan,” the Department of Defense said in a statement late on Saturday night.
The first wave of U.S. force — a team of 90 Marines and sailors — flew to Philippines on Sunday to assist with search and rescue operations and provide air support, the Marines said in a statement.
On Sunday afternoon, U.S. President Barack Obama released a statement saying:

Our thoughts and prayers go out to the millions of people affected by this devastating storm.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"As the full devastation of Typhoon Haiyan became more evident Sunday, frustrations were running high among survivors desperate for relief aid three days after the disaster.
Typhoon Haiyan pummeled the Philippines’ eastern seaboard Friday. It flattened buildings and toppled trees, and authorities are still struggling to assess the full extent of damage left behind.
Survivors in some areas hardest-hit do not have access to food, water or an ability to communicate. Even the Philippine Red Cross and the ICRC offices in badly-hit Tacloban had been damaged, forcing staff to relocate temporarily.
“The devastation is ... I don't have the words for it,"" Interior Secretary Mar Roxas said. ""It's really horrific. It's a great human tragedy.""
The country had been bracing for rain and winds, but a massive storm surge of six metres caught the archipelago by surprise Friday, reaching up to a kilometre inland. Residents drowned and were washed away.
With winds that gusted to 275 kilometres per hour, officials say the typhoon was more powerful than 2007’s Hurrican Katrina, and twice as strong as Hurricane Sandy, which devastated parts of Northeastern United States last year.
The destruction is far-reaching:
	_	_stimates say at least 4 million people have been affected by the storm.
	_	_aiyan inflicted serious damage to at least six of the archipelago's more than 7,000 islands
	_	_he islands of Leyte, Samar and the northern part of Cebu appearing to bear the brunt of the storm.
	_	_NICEF estimated that 1.7 million children live in areas affected by the typhoon.
At least 300 people were confirmed dead and 2,000 missing on the eastern island of Samar, where some towns remain inaccessible to emergency crews. An official from the provincial disaster office in Samar said there was no power or cellphone signals.
The death toll in Tacloban, the capital city of Leyte Island, is estimated at 10,000. There, corpses were found laying in the streets, cars floating in water. Homes along the shoreline were severely damaged. In one area of the city, a large ship had been pushed ashore.
Tacloban Mayor Alfred Romualdez said the devastation has touched all residents. “I have not spoken to anyone who has not lost someone, a relative close to them,” he said.
Philippine-born Australian Mila Ward, 53, told The Associated Press that she passed “well over 100” bodies on the street on the way to Tacloban airport.
“They were covered with just anything _ tarpaulin, roofing sheets, cardboard,” she said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"_ giant typhoon, churning with winds of more than 230 mph, descended on the central Philippines this morning, killing at least four people and leaving thousands more homeless and without electricity.
The speed of the storm may have ultimately been the country's salvation, as Typhoon Haiyan quickly blew across the island nation rather than sitting over land to wreak havoc.
The typhoon_ade landfall at 4:40 a.m. local time near Guiuan, on the Philippine island of Samar, about 405 miles southeast of the country's capital, Manila.
At least four people have been killed, according to local media. Two people were electrocuted in storm-related accidents, one person was killed by a fallen tree, and another was struck by lightning.
More than 748,000 people have already been evacuated to the 644 evacuation centers across the country. Government officials said more than 3,000 are stranded in ports.
The U.S. Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Center said shortly before the typhoon made landfall that its maximum sustained winds were 195 mph, with gusts up to 235 mph.
The world's strongest recorded hurricane, typhoon or cyclone to previously make landfall was Hurricane Camille of 1969, which roared ashore with 190 mph winds in Mississippi. Haiyan's sustained winds easily make it a category 5 hurricane.
The Philippines government weather bureau said Haiyan had sustained winds of 147 miles per hour, with gusts of 170 mph when it made landfall.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Associated Press quotes officials in the Philippines saying at least 13 people are dead in the wake of a powerful typhoon that swept through the northern part of the country early Saturday morning.
Officials say Typhoon Nari slammed into the east coast around midnight Friday, toppling trees and electric pylons, and dumping heavy rain across the rice-growing central plains of Luzon. Local authorities say the storm cut electricity to more than 2 million people.
Thousands of people were evacuated from coastal villages before the typhoon struck.
Nari forced U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry to cancel a trip to Manilla scheduled for Friday and Saturday. Kerry told reporters Thursday the he will try to reschedule the trip in the coming weeks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,wipha,"At least 17 people have been killed in Japan by powerful typhoon Wipha, according to media reports.
The typhoon hit Izu Oshima, an island south of Japan’s capital city Tokyo, on Wednesday morning. It threw life out of gear by causing landslides and flooding in the island. More than 80 centimetres of rain fell in a span of 24 hours in the island.
Around 50 people have been reported missing.  Japan Meteorological Agency had earlier called the typhoon as once-in-a-decade-event.
The typhoon has been downgraded to a “tropical storm” and is heading north-east. Reports also say that Fukushima nuclear plant, which was badly hit when a tsunami and an earthquake struck simultaneously in March 2011, did not face much damage. Nuclear plant authorities were quoted saying, “the typhoon has caused no new damage to the plant”.
It has also been reported that many houses have been buried in mudslides, triggered by the rain, trapping people underneath. Rescue operations are on and flights and trains in Tokyo have been cancelled.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"An island south of Tokyo, Izu Oshima, was worst hit by Typhoon Wipha, suffering landslides and flooding.
Many people died when houses collapsed or were buried in mudslides. At least 50 people remain unaccounted for.
Work to protect the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant was carried out but the operators say it appears to have escaped the worst of the storm.
In Tokyo, flights were cancelled, bullet train services suspended and schools closed.
""It is the strongest typhoon in 10 years to pass the Kanto [Tokyo area] region,"" Hiroyuki Uchida, the Japan Meteorological Agency's chief forecaster, told journalists on Tuesday.
Typhoon Wipha has now been downgraded to a tropical storm as it moves north-east.
The storm brought strong winds and record rainfall on Wednesday morning.
Nearly 5 inches (12cm) of rainfall fell in just one hour on Izu Oshima island, some 120km (75 miles) south of Tokyo.
The storm sent large volumes of earth down mountainsides and caused rivers to burst their banks.
Television footage showed the remains of wooden homes buried in mud and covered in debris.
""I heard a crackling sound and then the trees on the hillside all fell over,"" a woman on the island told national broadcaster NHK television. ""Then mud slid as far as the house.""
Japanese media said the death toll had risen to 16 but 51 people remained unaccounted for on Izu Oshima.
Rescuers were struggling to access many areas, local reports said.
""City hall and fire officials are doing rescue work in places that are accessible,"" a local official told AFP news agency.
Extra police officers and soldiers as well as helicopters have been sent to the island - a popular tourist destination with more than 8,000 residents - to help with the rescue effort.
In Tokyo, a woman died after falling in a river and a search was under way for two young boys last seen on a beach, reports said.
About 400 domestic and international flights were also cancelled in the capital, Kyodo news agency said.
Nearly 20,000 people were ordered to leave and thousands of schools shut as a result of the typhoon, Reuters news agency reported.
Around midday (03:00 GMT), the typhoon passed close to Fukushima, where contaminated water used to cool reactor cores is being stored in temporary tanks.
Plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Company said it had to pump out rain water from around the storage tanks, but added that its radiation readings were within a safe limit.
The storm had caused the plant no new problems, a spokesman said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Typhoon Wipha, which is currently a storm with 110 mph winds located several hundred miles south of Kyoto, Japan, appears poised to sideswipe, or possibly even make a direct hit on Japan in the coming days. The storm is expected to bring strong winds, heavy rain, and high waves to the Japanese coast from Tokyo northward, including the ailing Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, where cleanup efforts have already hit serious roadblocks.
Current forecasts show Wipha making landfall, or coming close to making landfall, near Tokyo on Tuesday into Wednesday, while transitioning from a weakening tropical cyclone into a hybrid storm, with characteristics of both a tropical storm and an extratropical system. Those characteristics are similar to some of the features that Hurricane Sandy had when it devastated the U.S. East Coast nearly a year ago this month. Wipha could bring an expanded area of high winds and pounding surf along with several inches of rain to heavily populated areas of Japan, including the vulnerable nuclear plant that was incapacitated by the massive earthquake and tsunami in 2011. The tsunami led to a series of cascading engineering failures, culminating in a triple nuclear meltdown at the plant in the worst accident at a nuclear power plant since Chernobyl in 1986.
Ryan Maue, a meteorologist at WeatherBell Analytics, a private forecasting firm, told Climate Central that the storm poses a “huge flood potential” for the Fukushima area. “Deep convection on the westward flank of the storm . . . plus the topography of Japan means heavy rain for the coastline regardless of the Typhoon's track,” he said in an email message. “Wipha is extra-large size-wise,” Maue said, predicting it will grow and strengthen as it makes its closest pass to Japan, aided by strong jet stream winds in the upper atmosphere.
Even in the absence of landfalling typhoons, cleanup work at Fukushima has hit numerous serious roadblocks, with recent discoveries that the plant has been leaking radioactive water into the Pacific Ocean. A team of 16 experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency is currently in Japan to visit the plant and advise the Japanese government on how to deal with the challenge of storing large amounts of radioactive material on site.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Here’s an astonishing statistic: Typhoon Wipha dumped 33 inches (850 mm) of rain in 24 hours on Oshima Island, 75 miles south of Tokyo.
It is the greatest rainstorm to occur on Oshima, populated by 8,200 people, since records began in 1991 reports the AP. It also twice the entire average rainfall for the month of October, notes the Wall Street Journal.
Incredibly, 17 inches (426 mm) fell in 4 hours and nearly 5 inches in one hour.
Those are unfathomable rainfall rates and, thus, it is no surprise they led to destructive mudslides and fatalities.
At least 17 people are dead from the typhoon and 45 to 50 missing according to wire reports. 16 of the 17 casualties occurred on Oshima.
283 homes were damaged or destroyed on Oshima, the AP says.
“The storm sent large volumes of earth down mountainsides and caused rivers to burst their banks,” reports the BBC. “Television footage showed the remains of wooden homes buried in mud and covered in debris.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"At least 13 people were killed and over 50 missing, with nearly 20,000 people ordered to evacuate and hundreds of flights cancelled as Typhoon Wipha pummelled Japan’s Pacific coast on Wednesday, leaving piles of wreckage on one small island but largely sparing the capital Tokyo.
Operators of the wrecked Fukushima nuclear power plant north of Tokyo pumped rainwater out of protective containers at the base of some 1,000 tanks storing radioactive water, and were taking other precautions, as the typhoon brushed past Tokyo and moved up the coastline.
Television footage showed roads clogged with heaps of wreckage and houses with gaping holes.
“I heard a crackling sound and then the trees on the hillside all fell over,” a woman on Oshima island told NHK national television. “Then mud slid as far as the house.”
The storm brought hurricane-force winds and drenching rain to the metropolis of 30 million people at the peak of the morning rush hour, halting some train services. Other trains operated at partial capacity.
The storm, which was picking up speed as it moved north, was 170 km (105 miles) south of the city of Miyako and moving north northeast at 75 kph (47 mph) at 11am (0200 GMT), according to the Japan Meteorological Agency’s website.
It carried sustained winds at its centre of 126 kph (78 mph) and gusts up to 180 kph (112 mph) and was expected to weaken into a tropical depression later on Wednesday.
Over 500 flights at Tokyo’s Haneda and Narita airports were cancelled, and several subway lines in the city stopped running due to the high winds. Thousands of schools closed as a precaution.
The typhoon passed close to the crippled Fukushima plant, 220 km (130 miles) north of Tokyo, shortly before noon.
The operator of the plant, Tokyo Electric Power Corp , which has been struggling to contain radioactive leaks, said it would cancel all offshore work and would decide whether to continue work onshore after assessing the weather.
It was pumping out rainwater at the tanks storing radioactive water, a by-product of a jerry-rigged cooling system designed to control reactors wrecked in a 2011 earthquake and tsunami.
The rainwater will be pumped into an empty tank, checked for radioactivity and, if uncontaminated, released into the sea, the company said.
Nissan Motor Co cancelled the Wednesday morning shift at its Oppama and Yokohama plants south of Tokyo and said it was waiting to decide what to do about later shifts. Oppama makes the all-electric Leaf and other models.
Typhoon Wipha is the strongest storm to approach eastern Japan since October 2004. The cyclone that year triggered floods and landslides that killed almost 100 people, forced thousands from their homes and caused billions of dollars in damage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Often the first reinsurance-linked investment manager to come out with an official statement after a catastrophe event, Swiss ILS investment manager Plenum Investments has said that it does not expect any impact to its catastrophe bond fund from Japanese Typhoon Wipha.
Typhoon Wipha struck Japan just over 24 hours ago, brushing the main island of Honshu and passing by Tokyo only around 30 miles offshore. Wipha brought typhoon force winds and tropical rainstorms to much of Japan, the storm itself was almost as large as the entire country and the Japanese meteorological association called it the largest and most powerful typhoon to strike Japan in a decade.
Japanese typhoon risks are a peril which is part of the catastrophe bond market, with a few outstanding cat bonds having exposure to the peril and thus to typhoon Wipha.
Plenum Investments said that as typhoon Wipha passed Japan it merged with a cold front and transitioned into an extratropical storm, much like Sandy did in the U.S. Wipha was much weaker though and also passed by Tokyo near to low tide which meant that storm surge damage will have been minimal.
Typhoon Wipha badly impacted some islands in the Izu cluster to the south of Tokyo, causing extensive damage and some loss of life, but damage to Tokyo and other metro areas of Japan is not expected to have been severe. Plenum notes that Japanese building codes and construction standards are designed to withstand storms of this severity meaning that only minor damages are to be expected.
Plenum Investments cat bond fund has only a limited exposure to Japan typhoon risk, of around 1.5% of the funds NAV. Due to the nature of the storm and the minimal exposure, Plenum Investments does not expect typhoon Wipha to have an adverse effect on its Japan typhoon cat bond investments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Tokyo: Hundreds fled their homes on Sunday on a Japanese island already devastated by a typhoon for fear that torrential rain would trigger fresh mudslides.
The town of Oshima, 120 kilometres south of Tokyo, advised 2,300 residents in two districts on the island of the same name to evacuate, saying rain was expected to intensify due to a depression.
A total of 632 people had taken shelter in school gyms and community halls by early afternoon, an official at the town’s administrative office said.
Many others were staying at relatives’ homes in safer areas of the island, she said.
The meteorological agency has warned that rainfall could reach 40 millimetres per hour in the afternoon and has urged residents to be on alert.
The rain could trigger fresh landslides on the island where at least 27 residents were killed as a typhoon struck last week. Two others died in or near Tokyo.
Twenty-one people were still missing but search operations were suspended due to the bad weather.
Military airplanes flew 14 inpatients at the island’s medical centre to hospitals in central Tokyo while Prime Minister Shinzo Abe cancelled his visit to the island set for Sunday.
Powerful typhoon Wipha triggered mudslides that buried some 30 houses and damaged more than 300 structures on Oshima last week.
Empress Michiko cancelled events scheduled Sunday at the imperial palace in Tokyo to celebrate her 79th birthday in the wake of the disaster.
An even stronger typhoon was churning north in the Pacific towards the Japanese archipelago.

Typhoon,,"Typhoon Wipha, currently located in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, is pushing to the northeast towards Japan over the next 24 hours. It will likely bring heavy rain, gusty winds, and large surf across the east coast of Japan today (October 15, 2013). Fortunately, Wipha is projected to weaken as it moves over cold waters and into an atmosphere that is unfavorable for strengthening as wind shear increases. Still, Typhoon Wipha is likely to add more problems to those trying to fix Japan’s damaged Fukushima nuclear plant, where there have been leaks of radioactive water into the ocean and several workers last week were accidentally doused with radioactive water.
As of October 15 at 9Z (or 5 a.m. EST), the Joint Typhoon Warning Center reports that Typhoon Wipha contains 80-knot winds, which is estimated around 90 miles per hour (mph) or 148 kilometers per hour (kph). The storm is accelerating to the northeast at 17 knots.
At one point, Wipha was a strong Category 4 typhoon with sustained winds around 130 mph this past Sunday. Now, Wipha is transitioning from a tropical system into an extratropical system. What does that mean? It means that its winds will likely expand outward and create a larger impact across Japan today. Rainfall totals of 3-7 inches are possible.
The extra rain and large surf is a major concern for the Fukushima plant trying to recover since the tragic earthquake and tsunami devastated the area back in 2011. Wipha will only complicate matters and result in delays in trying to fix radioactive leaks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,utor,"Last night (August 10, 2013), Typhoon Utor intensified into a Super Typhoon with winds estimated around 130 knots, or roughly 150 miles per hour. It is pushing to the northwest into the Philippines today, and made landfall around 3 a.m. according to local clocks there on Monday, August 12, 2013. Heavy rain, flash flooding, storm surge over 20 to 30 feet, and damaging winds are likely for the Philippines as the storm bears down on the northern island of Luzon.
Super Typhoon Utor, also known as Typhoon Labuyo in the Philippines, has been going through an eye wall replacement cycle. These cycles typically occur when storms become intense. The eye wall is where the strongest winds are located in the system, and when it becomes so strong, the eye wall typically collapses and reorganizes into another eye wall. During this transition phase, the cyclone becomes slightly weaker. The latest imagery from the storm does not indicate a visible eye, which could be good news for the the island of Luzon. However, the impacts are still expected to cause major problems.
Once Super Typhoon Utor pushes through the Philippines, it is expected to weaken into Category 1 or 2 storm. It will continue to push to the northwest and later impact parts of southeast China, and possibly skirting just to the south and west of Hong Kong. Forecasting the intensity of a tropical cyclone can be difficult, meaning everyone across the region should pay close attention to this typhoon over the next several days. However, it looks like there is potential for the storm to intensify after it pushes over the Philippines and emerges back over warm waters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Earth’s strongest storm of 2013 so far, typhoon Utor, did a number on the northern Philippines.  Now it’s destined for southeastern China.
Utor, referred to as Labuyo in the Philippines, packed maximum sustained winds of 140 mph as it battered the northern island of Luzon.
The storm killed at least two people and destroyed 80 percent of the infrastructure in town of Casiguran near where it came inland according to reports.
In the hours prior to landfall, Utor’s intensity peaked at 150 mph, the equivalent of high-end category 4 hurricane and earning it “super typhoon” status (winds must be 150 mph for “super typhoon” classification), briefly.  That intensity bested any storm globally in 2013 writes Jeff Masters at wunderground.
“Earth’s previous most powerful tropical cyclone of 2013 was Typhoon Soulik, which reached Category 4 strength with 145 mph winds on July 10,” Masters says.
As it passed over Luzon, Utor dumped over 7.5 inches of rain in the cities of Dagupan and and Baguio notes AccuWeather.
The storm weakened markedly as it crossed over Luzon’s mountainous terrain, but is likely to regain some strength as it passes over the South China Sea.  As of 11 a.m., the Joint Typhoon Warning Center says its maximum sustained winds are around 100 mph and it forecasts gradual strengthening over the next two days:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"A satellite map shows Typhoon Utor, which is referred to as Labuyo in the Philippines, at 2:32 p.m. local time Monday.
The world's strongest storm of the year so far plowed across the northern Philippines on Monday, killing at least one person and leaving 20 fishermen missing.
Packing winds as strong as 200 kilometers per hour (124 mph), Typhoon Utor made landfall early Monday on the east coast of the Philippine island of Luzon, damaging hundreds of houses.
""It's the strongest typhoon we've had so far on the planet this year,"" said CNN International meteorologist Samantha Mohr. ""So that gives you some idea of the magnitude of this system.""
Utor, known in the Philippines as Labuyo, churned west-northwest over Luzon, dumping heavy rain on the island's hilly terrain and bringing the risk of landslides. It weakened as it moved over land, and by Monday afternoon, it had begun to head out into the South China Sea.
Aid groups in the Philippines, which had been preparing for the storm's arrival for several days, said they were only just beginning to assess the situation on the ground in the hardest-hit areas.
""There's a high risk that part of the population may get isolated because of landslides and difficulty moving around,"" said Anna Lindenfors, country director for Save the Children in the Philippines.
The country's National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council reported one death in the province of Benguet on Monday afternoon.
Twenty fishermen who had headed out to sea before the storm's arrival remained unaccounted for, the agency said. But dozens of others who had initially been reported missing had returned home safely, it said.
The agency reported damage to 673 houses in the province of Aurora, where the storm made landfall.
The typhoon destroyed nearly 80% of the infrastructure in Casiguran, a town that lay in Utor's path across the province, CNN affiliate ABS-CBN reported.
The storm tore apart rickety houses and ripped the roof off a local hospital, the local broadcaster said, showing images of flattened homes buried under fallen trees.
Situated near an area of the Pacific Ocean where typhoons form, the Philippines regularly suffers severe storm damage.
An average of 20 typhoons hit the Southeast Asian country every year, and two or three of those cause serious damage, according to Plan International, an aid and development organization.
Utor is expected to pick up more strength over the warm waters of the South China Sea over the next day or so before making landfall on the southern coast of China on Wednesday.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"CloudSat overpassed Typhoon Utor in the West Pacific on August 11, 2013 at 0518 UTC, this storm contained estimated maximum strength winds of 115 knots (132 mph) and minimum pressure of 937mb.
The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA's Aqua satellite captured the infrared (IR) image taken a few minutes before the CloudSat overpass (the blue line A-> B on Figures 1, 2 and 3). CloudSat overpassed about 10km to the east of the center of the storm revealing the structure of the eye and eye wall. This is one a handful of cases where CloudSat has directly intersected the eye of a storm of this intensity and size. The strength of Utor's at this time is equivalent to category 4 strength hurricane.
This overpass reveals many unique features of a well defined and intense Typhoon (tropical cyclone) - outward sloping eye and eyewall, rainband areas, moats and areas of high reflectivity (greater than 30dBZ). Heavy precipitation is distinuguished by the attenuation of the radar (lack of signal) in the lowest 5 km's (up to almost 10 km's in the eyewall area) of the CloudSat swath. The CloudSat overpasses reveals large amounts of liquid and ice water spread throughout the storm and also distinguishes rainbands areas separated by moats (cloud free areas) beneath the cirrus canopy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Footage from ABS-CBN TV network showed a woman being swept away by a raging river in neighbouring Isabela province. The woman waved her hands for help as she struggled to hang on to debris while being buffeted by huge waves in the muddy waters. It was not immediately clear what happened to her.
""We have no official report yet, and we do not know if up to this time she has not been rescued,"" said Norma Talosig, a regional civil defence director. She said the woman lived alone in a low-lying area in San Agustin town and had refused to be evacuated.
In mountainous Benguet province, a 22-year-old man died on the way to hospital after he was pulled from a landslide that hit the roadside canal he was clearing, said regional civil defence official Andrew Alex Uy.
The typhoon triggered waves of up to 2.5 metres (8ft) and left scores of fishermen missing.
In northern Pangasinan province, 25 fishermen on board three boats failed to return home, said a provincial police spokesman, Senior Inspector Ryan Manongdo.
Twenty people from the eastern provinces of Catanduanes and Camarines Norte were also unaccounted for. Authorities were hoping they had taken shelter in coves and on nearby islands, said Bernardo Alejandro IV, the regional director for the office of civil defence.
""I hope they're just waiting for the typhoon to pass and will show up as soon as the weather clears,"" he said.
As of Monday afternoon, the typhoon had crossed the Philippines' main northern island of Luzon and was off the country's north-west coast with winds of 87mph and gusts of 106 mph, government weather forecaster Jun Galang said.
He said the typhoon may intensify over the South China Sea as it moves toward China. He said the storm carried a lot of rain but was moving fast, so the rainfall was not concentrated in one area. Utor was forecast to make landfall in Guandong, China, on Wednesday.
About 1,000 residents in the Bicol region of the central Philippines spent the night in shelters, while Aurora province was without power, the national disaster agency said. Radio stations reported roofs being blown off and a covered basketball court was washed away in Dinalungan town.
About 1,100 travellers remained stranded as passenger and cargo ferries were grounded. School classes in towns and cities on the typhoon's path were suspended, including in Manila, the capital. Several domestic flights were cancelled.

Some train and shipping services were also suspended, with waves of over 10 meters (32 feet) expected in some coastal zones.
Utor was the worst typhoon to hit the Philippines this year, displacing over 30,000 families as it caused landslides and floods and disrupted power and communications links.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Four people were killed while 67 — including 53 fishermen and nine mountaineers — remained missing as Typhoon Utor left for the South China Sea after a deadly 24-hour landfall in Luzon on Monday.
Reynaldo de la Cruz, 53, drowned in Nueva Vizcaya, northern Luzon on Tuesday, a day after Typhoon Utor entered Aurora Province causing floods, landslides and toppling trees and power lines, said Undersecretary Eduardo del Rosario, head of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC).
Del Rosario added that Joemar Salicong, 22, died in a landslide in Tuba, Benguet, also in northern Luzon on Monday.
Earlier on Saturday Dolores Montero, 68 and her granddaughter Erica Montero Sim, 8, drowned when their motorboat was destroyed off Buenavista coastal village in Cagnion, Surigao, central Philippines, another affected area, said del Rosario.
He said the two victims were identified by NDRRMC’s provincial office.
Meanwhile, a ground report from northern Luzon said that Benny Labio, 40, died when his house was swallowed by the Cagayan River in Maand village, San Agustin town, meaning the number of fatalities could reach five.
“We hope this is the final list of casualties,” del Rosario said, adding the number could change dramatically in the storm’s aftermath.
Some 35 fishermen from the western Pangasinan towns of Infanta and Bolinao were reported missing after they failed to return home from sailing on August 5 and 8, said del Rosario, adding that five of the fishermen were not yet identified.
Some 23 fishermen from Camarines Norte and Catanduanes in Bicol, southern Luzon, remained missing after they set sail last week, before Typhoon Utor was seen in the Pacific Ocean, said del Rosario, adding they were part of a group of 75 fishermen who sailed to the sea, 52 of whom managed to return safely on Sunday.
Meanwhile, nine mountaineers were reported missing after they failed to return from Mount Tarak in Alas-asin village, in Bataan on Saturday, Bataan Governor Albert Garcia said, adding that Typhoon Utor might be responsible for their disappearance. Their names were not released.
Some 30 kilometres of road was flooded in Dilasalag, Aurora, the hardest hit province in northeastern Luzon, where three towns, Casiguran, Dilasag, and Dinalungan were declared in a state of calamity, said del Rosario.
Ninety per cent of crops were damaged in Dilasalag due to floods, confirmed Mayor Victorio Briones.
Almost all roads were impassable due to floods and landslides in many towns of Aurora, said Aurora Governor Gerardo Noveras, adding that power came back 24 hours after rains and winds toppled electric poles in these towns.
Seventy three houses were damaged while five were destroyed in Aurora, said Noveras, adding the typhoon’s wrath is still being assessed in Aurora’s tow other towns such as Dingalan and Dipaculao.
People stranded on riverbanks were evacuated in coastal towns of Nueva Vizcaya, another hard hit area in northern Luzon, TV footage showed.
In other submerged areas, rising rivers swept animals, crops, and houses, the same report said.
Floods isolated several towns in Isabela province although it was not directly hit by the typhoon, said Isabela Gov. Faustino Dy III.
People rejoiced when nine passengers and a driver emerged alive from a vehicle that was buried by a landslide in Itogon town, northern Luzon on Tuesday morning, said Chief Inspector Fernando Botangen of the Itogon police.
A four-metre high flood occurred in Baguio City’s Camp Lagoon. The northern Luzon summer capital also suffered power outage, telecommunications failure, and road closures due to rockfalls.
The typhoon dumped most of its 24-hour rain in northern Luzon’s Baguio City; central Luzon’s Dagupan and Cabanatuan cities and Iba town, Zambales, said the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa), a government run weather station.
Typhoon Utor left the Philippines early on Tuesday morning, Pagasa confirmed.
A total of 20 storms enter the Philippines every year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Typhoon Utor powered ashore on the northern Philippine Island of Luzon on Monday near 3 am local time (3 pm EDT Sunday) as a Category 4 storm with 140 mph winds. Damage was heavy in Casiguran (population 24,000) near where the typhoon made landfall, with 80% of the infrastructure of the town reportedly destroyed, and all roads into the city blocked. Utor is being blamed for two deaths so far, and 44 fishermen are reported as missing.
Passage over Luzon disrupted the inner core of Utor, reducing the storm to Category 2 strength with winds of 100 mph. Satellite imagery shows that the typhoon is re-organizing, and a new eyewall is forming. Ocean temperatures are very warm, about 30°C (86°F), which is approximately 0.5 - 1.0°C above average. These warm waters extend to tremendous depth, giving Utor a huge source of energy to tap into. Wind shear is low, 5 - 10 knots. These favorable conditions for intensification will last until the typhoon gets midway between the Philippines and China, where wind shear will rise to the moderate range and ocean waters will cool to 29°C with a much lower heat content. I expect Utor will intensify into a Category 3 storm today, and make landfall in China as a Category 2 or 3 storm about 200 hundred miles southwest of Hong Kong about 06 UTC on Wednesday. Utor is a very wet storm, and will likely bring a large swath of 8+ inches of rain across Southeast China on Wednesday. These rains will cause dangerous flash flooding and mudslides.
Utor is a Marshallese word for squall line, and has been used for three tropical cyclones in the Western Pacific--in 2001, 2006, and 2013. Utor reached super typhoon status with 150 mph winds on Sunday, making it the strongest tropical cyclone globally so far in 2013. Earth's previous most powerful tropical cyclone of 2013 was Typhoon Soulik, which reached Category 4 strength with 145 mph winds on July 10. Soulik weakened to a Category 2 storm before hitting Taiwan on July 12.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Twenty-three people were missing as Typhoon Utor swept across the northern Philippines on Monday, ripping roofs off houses, tearing down power lines and triggering landslides in remote villages.
With wind gusts of 200 kilometres (124 miles) an hour, Utor was the most powerful storm to strike the Philippines this year and authorities were on alert for worst-case scenarios.
""This has the strongest sustained winds for the year,"" government weather forecaster Samuel Duran told AFP.
Hundreds of people die each year in the Philippines from the roughly 20 typhoons that strike the country annually.
There were no immediate reports of casualties from Utor on Monday morning, but the national disaster agency said it was concerned for 23 missing fishermen.
""They went out to sea before we declared that a storm was approaching,"" said National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council spokesman Reynaldo Balido.
""We are still hoping that within the day, they will return home. The practice in those areas is if a storm is approaching, they seek refuge somewhere.""
There were also concerns for remote towns and villages that had been isolated by the storm, with telecommunications networks to the areas out of order and roads cut off by landslides.
After building strength in the Pacific Ocean, Utor hit the northern regions of the main island of Luzon at 3:00 am on Monday (1900 GMT on Sunday).
Television footage from Aurora province, along the east coast of Luzon where Utor made landfall, showed uprooted trees that had fallen on top of houses, while roofs were ripped off some buildings.
The civil defence director for Aurora province, Josefina Timoteo, said reports had been received of more than 600 houses and 12 school buildings being damaged in one town, Dinalungan.
Alex Uy, the civil defence chief in charge of the northern mountain city of Baguio, said power outages were widespread across northern Luzon.
""The wind speed is strong enough to topple power lines. Even in our office, we have no electricity. We have to use a generator,"" Uy told AFP.
As of midday (0400 GMT), the storm was about half way across Luzon, passing over some of the most mountainous and isolated terrain in the country, moving westward towards the South China Sea.
It was expected to move out of the Philippines by late Monday, according to the weather bureau.
In Manila, the nation's capital, roughly 200 kilometres to the south of the storm, there was heavy rain overnight but no major flooding.
With more rain expected, many schools across the capital were closed on Monday.
Over a thousand people were killed when Typhoon Bopha hit the Philippines in December, the most devastating storm in the world for 2012.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Typhoon Utor, the strongest weather disturbance to enter the Philippines this year, battered the northern provinces in the main island of Luzon early Monday, stranding more than 8,000 passengers, forcing several flights and ferries to be canceled, knocking power out in a couple of provinces and leaving 23 fishermen missing, disaster officials said.
Classes in the Philippine capital of Manila and its neighboring provinces were suspended in anticipation of bad weather, but rains weren't as heavy and winds weren't as strong as they were in the provinces of Aurora, Nueva Viscaya and Isbela.
Typhoon Utor gathered speed as it made landfall on Aurora province, traveling at 22 kilometers per hour, at dawn Monday. Its sustained winds slowed to 140 kilometers per hour from 160 kph, while gustiness weakened to 170 kph from 200 kph. The typhoon's rain band also shrunk to 500 kilometers from 600 kilometers.
Typhoon Utor is expected to be over the South China Sea and outside from the Philippines' area of responsibility by early Tuesday, weather forecast Jori Loiz told a televised briefing Monday.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Heavy rain and howling winds are lashing the northern Philippines and Taiwan as Typhoon Usagi goes through the Luzon Strait which divides them.
Villages have been evacuated, ferries suspended and flights cancelled.
Meteorologists say the storm is the most powerful this year and will bring a cumulative rainfall of 1,000mm (39in) as it heads towards China.
The authorities there have announced a red alert ahead of the expected arrival of the storm on Monday.
The US Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Centre said on Friday that Usagi was packing sustained winds of 240 km/h (150 mph), with gusts of up to 296 km/h (185mph), making it the equivalent of a strong category four Atlantic hurricane.
Taiwan is reported to have deployed more than 1,600 soldiers in ""high risk"" areas prone to flooding and landslides while placing 24,000 others on standby.
Authorities in the Philippines are reported to have evacuated nearly 250 people in the northern agricultural province of Tarlac, while ferries are restricted to their ports.
There are particular concerns about the impact of the storm on the Batanes islands in the north of the Philippines, with warnings that large trees could be uprooted, plantations flattened and power and communications severely disrupted by flash flooding, landslides and storm surges.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Chinese state media report that the death toll in the northeast of the country has risen to 37 since floods began on August 10.
Liaoning province reported 12 flood-related deaths after downpours on Friday and Saturday, 14 were killed in Jilin province, and officials in Heilongjiang province said 11 had died, according to the official Xinhua news agency.
Xinhua reported that the flooding in the area was the worst in several decades, displacing some 140,000 people and destroying more than 2,500 houses. Railways and highways were cut off and bridges damaged.
Losses have been put at 7.13 billion yuan ($1.17 billion, 874 million euros).
Meanwhile, Southern China is recovering after being battered by Typhoon Utor last week. Xinhua said 10 people were dead and four others missing in the southern province of Guangdong and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
Flood of the century
Across the border in Russia, flooding has also caused widespread devastation in the country's far east, though no casualties have been reported so far.
The floods have been declared a natural disaster in the worst-affected regions of Amur and Khabarovsk. Authorities say the floods are the worst in more than a century.
Tens of thousands of emergency services workers and civilians have been struggling to contain the waters of the Amur River on Russia's border with China. The minister of Regional development, Viktor Ishayev, said more than 17,000 people had been evacuated and that this figure could rise to as many as 100,000.
""The damage is extensive, but the most significant achievement is there have been no casualties ... we cannot relax, there is still a lot of work to be done,"" Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a televised address on Saturday.
The Interfax news agency reported that Prime Minister Dimitry Medvedev had earmarked 3.2 billion rubles (73 million euros, $97 million) for the affected regions, though the bill for damage is expected to be much higher.
The flooding occurred after massive rains since the end of July caused the Amur River, and one of its tributaries, the Zeya, to burst their banks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,danas,"While tropical systems in the Atlantic Basin have been sputtering, leaving many breathing a sigh of relief, a typhoon in the Western Pacific had thousands of Americans on edge.
Danas, at one time a typhoon packing winds of 145 miles per hour, made a beeline toward the Japanese island of Okinawa. Okinawa is the home to Kadena Air Force base, which houses more than 18,000 American military personnel and their families. Luckily, Danas didn't make a direct hit on the island or the base and no immediate reports of damage were available.  
In an email to The Weather Channel the public affairs office on Kadena Air Force base says they used a graduated system of warnings, ranging from TC-4 to TC-1.  TC-4 is a general state of readiness where people have the basic essentials already stocked away. TC-1 is where 50 knot or greater winds are expected within 12 hours.  It also means that all facilities, except mission critical components, will be closed and people should fill available containers with drinking water.  While at TC-1 earlier in the day Tuesday, the bas has now been backed down to TC-4 and normal activities can resume.
As for staying informed about the latest, in the States, Kadena's public affairs office says this: ""Stateside friends and family like the Kadena Air Base Facebook page, and many people have already liked that page so they can keep up with what their family and friends are doing overseas.""
 Danas quickly weakened to a tropical storm after crossing the Japanese island of Tsushima, between South Korea and the Japanese mainland. And continued on a northeasterly course.
According to South Korean broadcaster KBS, Busan port closed for a bit as the former typhoon passed the region. The port is South Korea's largest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Typhoon Fitow barrelled into China's east coast early Monday, packing winds of more than 200 kilometres an hour after hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated, state media reported.
At least two people were reported killed, both near Wenzhou in Zhejiang province, the state news agency Xinhua said.
Parts of Zhejiang, which neighbours the commercial hub Shanghai, saw nearly 29 centimetres (11 inches) of rain over 17 hours from Sunday to early Monday, while areas in Fujian to the south saw up to 16 centimetres, the official China News Service said.
In the hard-hit Cangnan county in Wenzhou, more than 1,200 homes collapsed and damages amounted to hundreds of millions of yuan, China National Radio said.
One of the victims, 55-year-old Ni Wenlin, died ""after strong wind blew him off a hill"" late Sunday, Xinhua said, citing municipal flood control authorities.
In Fujian the typhoon broke electricity poles in half, leaving power lines on the ground, and bent iron roadsigns out of shape, CNR reported.
In the coastal city of Ningde, a village leader told the Beijing Times that huge waves had damaged a 200-hectare (490-acre) seaweed farm, which nearly 100 families depended on for their livelihood.
The typhoon ""broke the bamboo poles holding the seaweed in place"", said Lin Fangqin.
The storm is expected to move northwest but ""weaken quickly"", Xinhua said on Monday, citing the National Meteorological Centre (NMC).
Authorities evacuated hundreds of thousands of people and issued China's highest alert on Sunday as Fitow approached the mainland.
The NMC issued a red alert for the storm, which was packing winds of up to 151 kilometres (94 miles) an hour late Sunday night as it moved towards the coast
Winds rose to 201 km per hour in parts of Wenzhou, the official Xinhua news agency reported later, citing local flood control authorities.
Zhejiang has so far evacuated more than 574,000 people, while in Fujian 177,000 have been displaced, Xinhua said.
Two port workers in Wenzhou were missing and may have fallen into the sea, the agency added.
Zhejiang governor Li Qiang urged local authorities to increase inspections of dams and reservoirs as well as safety checks of chemical plants and other important facilities, Xinhua reported.
The storm also forced the suspension of bullet train services in several cities in Zhejiang, Fujian and Jiangxi provinces, Xinhua said.
Wenzhou's airport cancelled 27 flights Sunday, the agency said.
Xinhua quoted the weather centre as saying it was unusual for a typhoon to come ashore in China's southeast during October, at the end of the storm season.
Chinese maritime authorities also issued red alerts, warning of storm tides and waves, with fishermen urged to return to port and local authorities told to prepare harbour facilities and sea walls for high tides.
In Zhejiang more than 35,000 boats returned to harbour while in Fujian nearly 30,000 vessels were called back, according to Xinhua.
Named after a flower from Micronesia, Fitow has hit just two weeks after Typhoon Usagi wreaked havoc in the region, leaving at least 25 reported dead in southern China.
Fitow, which Xinhua described as the 23rd storm to hit China this year, earlier passed through Japan's southern Okinawan island chain, forcing flight cancellations and causing power outages.
Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau had issued a warning over the storm Sunday morning as it surged past the north of the island.
A total of 103 international flights were cancelled in Taiwan, while 14 flights were delayed. Seventeen ferry services between Taiwan and offshore islands were also halted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"As per forecasts discussed in our blog last week, Cyclone Phailin struck the east coast of India over the weekend with winds estimated at near 130 mph.
It brought a strong storm surge along the coast and more than 230 mm (9 inches) of rain was recorded as the cyclone passed.
The cyclone was of a similar strength to one which struck just a little further up the coast in 1999, which claimed more than 10,000 lives.
Excellent forecasts for Phailin, combined with well executed warning and evacuation procedures, meant the loss of life was much less this time around.
Phailin became a tropical storm a little more than three days before landfall, but computer models were able to give far greater warning than this.
Medium range prediction models suggested a higher risk of cyclone formation in the Bay of Bengal a full nine days before Cyclone Phailin struck.
At six days ahead, shorter range models were predicting that the north-eastern coast of India could be under threat, although the timing was not certain at that stage.
Four days ahead, computer models were able to pinpoint the location and timing of landfall to a high degree of accuracy _ all before the storm was strong enough to be named.
Cyclone Phailin originated from a disturbance in the far west Pacific basin and was one of a series of tropical storms seen in this region recently.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Heavy rainfall was expected all through the weekend in northern and northeastern Taiwan due to the approach of Typhoon Fitow, the Central Weather Bureau said Saturday.
The bureau issued a land warning for Taipei, New Taipei, Keelung and Yilan Saturday afternoon, though it added that torrential rain was possible as far south as Taichung and Nantou County.
At 9 p.m. Saturday, Fitow was located about 440 kilometers east of Taipei and moving west-north-west at a speed of 19 km per hour, according to the weather bureau. The storm was packing sustained winds of 137 km per hour with gusts of up to 173 km per hour. The storm’s route was 20 to 40 km more southerly than originally expected, which meant Taoyuan and Hsinchu could eventually also be covered by the land warnings, reports said.
By early Sunday afternoon, the center of the storm would have moved to 240 km northeast of Taipei over the ocean, the bureau said. The eye of the typhoon was unlikely to make landfall but nevertheless, forecasters still cautioned residents to be prepared for strong winds and heavy rains as well as flooding and mudslides, even in southern mountain areas.
The total amount of rainfall in the north could reach 350 millimeter over the next 24 hours, according to the bureau. The highest amount of rain Saturday until 9:20 p.m. was the 151 mm recorded in New Taipei City’s Wulai District.
Sea warnings were also in effect on Taiwan’s east side and in most of the Taiwan Straits with the exception of the Kaohsiung and Pingtung coastal areas. Strong waves were expected to hit most coastal areas, including those of Orchid Island and Green Island in the southeast, the bureau said.
The typhoon would leave Taiwan behind on Monday, but another storm was already on the way, according to the bureau.
The next tropical storm on the horizon, Danas, was unlikely to speed up sufficiently to combine forces with Fitow, experts said. Fitow was expected to make landfall in China Monday and to weaken considerably thereafter, while Danas was likely to move in the direction of Japan, though it was not clear yet how serious its impact on Taiwan might be. Some forecasters have suggested that the storm might affect the island’s Double Ten National Day celebrations Thursday.
President Ma Ying-jeou and Premier Jiang Yi-huah visited the national emergency center late Saturday afternoon to receive an overview of the situation, reports said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At least 59 bullet trains in Zhejiang were cancelled, along with 22 flights from the provincial capital Hangzhou and 27 in Wenzhou, Xinhua said.
Sections of highways were shut and more than 350 buses from Wenzhou were cancelled.
Forecasters said the storm was expected to move northwest but weaken quickly.
But continued rainstomes were expected due to another typhoon, Danas, which was set to hit Japan's main islands on Monday.
Packing winds of up to 180 kilometres per hour near its centre, Danas was battering the southern Japanese chain of Okinawa, where more than 50 flights at Naha airport were cancelled while schools were shut, according to local media.
The Japanese meteorological agency issued an alert for strong winds and high waves, while urging residents to remain on guard for floods and landslides as well as lightning and tornadoes.
Local authorities in Okinawa and Kagoshima separately issued evacuation advisories to some 6,500 households, public broadcaster NHK said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Typhoon,,"Millions of residents were affected as a rainstorm hit a large swathe of eastern China on Tuesday, flooding downtown areas and snarling traffic.
The storm, triggered under the influence of Typhoon Fitow, continued to strike Shanghai and Zhejiang province, forcing both to raise the rainstorm alarm to the highest level of red on Tuesday morning.
In the 12 hours up to 11 am on Tuesday Shanghai reported average rainfall of more than 100 millimeters, while on the outskirts of the city 200 mm fell.
Zhang Ruiyi, a chief service officer at the Shanghai Meteorological Bureau, said the storm was caused by the remaining depression from Fitow encountering cold air.
The continuous rain, the rising tide and discharge of floodwater from upstream Taihu Lake caused the Huangpu River, which runs through Shanghai, to rise past the warning line on Tuesday.
According to the city's flood control headquarters, the river burst its flood control wall in suburban sections. No deaths were reported in the region.
In Zhejiang, Yuyao, a city with a population of about 850,000, was one of the hardest hit. More than 70 percent of the city's downtown area was flooded, forcing public transportation to be suspended.
The city's power and tap water supplies were also interrupted, and residents are short of food and clean water. Soldiers rushed in large trucks and speedboats to help with disaster response.
But relief for residents in the region is on the way, with forecasters in Shanghai predicting cloudy weather on Wednesday and clear skies from Thursday.
Meteorological authorities in Zhejiang lowered the red rainstorm alarm at 12:30 pm on Tuesday, saying that most areas of the province will remain cloudy on Wednesday and Thursday, with showers in some areas.
Typhoon Danas, following on the heels of Fitow, has turned northeast in the Pacific and is unlikely to make landfall on the Chinese mainland. Meteorologists warned that high winds will hit the east coast although Danas has been weakening.
The death toll from Fitow and the rainstorm it generated has risen to six with another four missing in Zhejiang.
Figures from the provincial flood control headquarters show that by 6 pm on Monday more than 6.31 million people had been affected, with 4,000 houses flattened.
Floods also damaged hundreds of thousands of hectares of crops, killed more than 11,000 livestock, disrupted traffic and telecommunications, put dams and reservoirs at risk and caused direct economic losses of 8.4 billion yuan ($1.37 billion) in Zhejiang.
Li Minji, an official at Hangzhou's flood control department, said flooding was reported in 31 communities and 58 sections of roads in the city on Tuesday, with emergency workers busy clearing floodwaters and bringing in traffic controls.
The water level at popular tourist attraction West Lake rose to 7.48 meters on Tuesday, 0.18 meters higher than the danger level.
In Shanghai, pictures posted by Internet users showed a flooded classroom at Tongji University, two residents in Songjiang district rowing a boat on a flooded road, and a bus nearly submerged in a low-lying area.
Cheng Xu, 40, was just one of many people caught out by the floods on Monday. Her flight, due to arrive at Hangzhou airport at 7 am, was delayed for four hours. A shuttle bus then took two and a half hours to make a journey usually taking 45 minutes.
After she got off the bus, it took her another two hours to get close to her home, with traffic controls in place on the road to her apartment building because of the flooding.
""No cars were allowed on that road. I dragged my suitcases, weighing almost 20 kilograms, and walked in heavy rain from the street to my apartment,"" she said.
Zhu Zheng, who lives in Hangzhou's Yuhang district, said he woke up to find floodwater inside at least 12 cars in the area.

Typhoon,,"China was on its highest alert for Typhoon Fitow Sunday, with tens of thousands evacuated as the storm was set to slam into the east coast as early as Sunday night.
The National Meteorological Centre issued a red alert for the storm, saying it was expected to make landfall in China late Sunday or early Monday somewhere between the south of Zhejiang province and the north of Fujian province.
The storm, which the centre classified as ""strong"" with winds up to 151 kilometres (94 miles) an hour, was located Sunday afternoon about 280 kilometres southeast of the city of Wenzhou in Zhejiang and moving at a speed of 18 kilometres an hour.
Zhejiang has so far evacuated more than 130,000 people ahead of the expected landfall, state news agency Xinhua said.
""We must not leave anybody in danger,"" said Li Qiang, the provincial governor.
He urged local authorities to increase inspections of dams and reservoirs as well as safety checks of chemical plants and other important facilities, Xinhua reported.

Chinese maritime authorities also issued red alerts, warning of storm tides and waves kicked up by Fitow.
Fishermen were urged to return to port and local authorities were told to prepare harbour facilities and sea walls for high tides.
Fitow, named after a flower from Micronesia, comes just two weeks after Typhoon Usagi wreaked havoc in the region.

Typhoon,,"An approaching powerful typhoon has left at least one person dead, another missing and prompted the evacuation of more than 100,000 people as a precaution in the eastern and central Philippines, although the unusual summer storm is not expected to blow into land, officials said Monday.
Typhoon Surigae was about 500 kilometers (310 miles) east of Infanta town in Quezon province on Monday afternoon with sustained winds of 195 kilometers (121 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 240 kph (149 mph). It is forecast to slowly move northwestward and then veer eastward away from the northern Philippines around Thursday.
Vicente Malano, administrator of the government weather agency, said a high pressure area extending from China to Japan was blocking the typhoon from blowing inland.
“We’re lucky it’s not going to make landfall because if it hits land, it’s really going to be super devastating,” said Ariel Rojas from the weather agency.
The typhoon’s 900-kilometer (560-mile) band of rainclouds and strong winds nevertheless flooded at least 22 villages and caused power outages in four provinces. More than 3,200 people and 43 ferries and cargo ships were stranded in seaports after the coast guard suspended sea travel as the typhoon blew nearer, the government disaster-response agency and the coast guard said.
A 79-year-old man died in St. Bernard town in Southern Leyte province after being hit by a falling coconut tree, the Office of Civil Defense said. Another villager in San Jose town in Northern Samar province was missing after he went to a nearby island in a motorboat to secure his farm animals, it said.

wildfires,Australian wildfires declared among the 'worst wildlife disasters in modern history',"Nearly 3 billion animals were affected by Australia's worst wildfire season that burned from last July through March, scientists announced Tuesday — a figure almost three times higher than original estimates.
The report released Tuesday and commissioned by the World Wide Fund for Nature Australia said more than 46 million acres were scorched. An estimate in January said 1.25 billion animals were affected.
""This ranks as one of the worst wildlife disasters in modern history,” Dermot O’Gorman, the organization's chief executive officer, said in a statement. ""It’s hard to think of another event anywhere in the world in living memory that has killed or displaced that many animals.""
Ten researchers from Australian universities and wildlife groups involved in the report have been looking at both the impact of the fires and the possible ways to protect ecosystems in the future.
The affected wildlife includes 143 million mammals, 2.46 billion reptiles, 180 million birds and 51 million frogs.
""It's almost impossible to comprehend how many individuals that actually means,"" Lily van Eeden, a researcher at the University of Sydney and a co-author of the report, told NBC News.
The jump in the estimated animals affected compared to the January report is due to a wider geographic area being studied and new data on wildlife, she said.
Despite the increased scope of the research, Van Eeden cautioned, the estimate is still ""quite conservative.""
Invertebrate species — such as spiders and butterflies — were not included and neither was a range of wildlife that lives in waterways like turtles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wildfires,Wildfires: Australia needs national monitoring agency,"Just before the COVID-19 pandemic, bush fires in Australia destroyed more than 3,000 homes and burnt millions of hectares of vegetation. The crisis exposed the nation’s fire monitoring system as being unfit for purpose. Precise real-time information about the area burnt and the intensity of the fires was not available when it was needed.
Australia does not have a central system for gathering and storing essential information about bush fires. State and territory governments, and even agencies within states, have different approaches. This worked fine when fires were smaller. But those in the 2019_20 season crossed multiple state borders.
The blazes engulfed a huge geographic range and burnt for a duration and intensity that was beyond the experience of communities and fire managers1. Many Australians endured five months of smoke pollution that breached national air-quality standards. Usually, people would experience shorter bouts covering smaller areas2.
The extraordinary scale and intensity of the fires were driven by climate conditions not seen in a century: three years of drought, including three consecutive, anomalously dry winters3. This weather is consistent with predictions that global warming will result in conditions that increase the risk of fire4,5. Studies have linked extreme bush-fire seasons over the past few years to anthropogenic climate change
Debate over the cause of the bush fires became politically charged. Fire scientists and managers had to stem misinformation from politicians and the media suggesting that the fires were not unusual historically and were not linked to climate change. There were even suggestions that the fires were the result of arson, or of inappropriate land management8_10. Staggering environmental consequences were claimed, including greenhouse-gas emissions that were exceeded only by those in China, the United States, India, Russia and Japan, and the loss or displacement of more than one billion native vertebrates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wildfires,Australia's wildfire crisis: Key numbers behind the disaster,"SYDNEY (BLOOMBERG) - Australia is in the grip of deadly wildfires burning across the country, triggering an emotive debate about the impact of climate change in the world's driest-inhabited continent. The unprecedented scale of the crisis, and images of terrified tourists sheltering on beaches from the inferno, have shocked many Australians.
With summer only just beginning and the nation affected by a prolonged drought, the authorities fear the death toll will continue to mount as more homes and land are destroyed. Here are some key details of the crisis:
How many people have died?
Since the fire season began months ago during the southern hemisphere winter, 23 people have died. With six people missing in Victoria state, the authorities fear the death toll will rise. Among the fatalities are volunteer firefighters, including a young man who died when his 10-tonne truck was flipped over in what officials have described as a ""fire tornado"".

On a deadly 24-hour march through the Sierra Nevada in September, the flames of what would become the North Complex fire raced through more than 200,000 acres of dense timber, destroyed a historic schoolhouse and overtook a beloved camp for children with cancer.
Also in its path was the remote settlement of Berry Creek, where Daniel Salazar, 27, found himself once again facing an unprecedented, out of control blaze. Less than two years earlier, Salazar had escaped the Camp fire, which killed his grandparents and 83 others in and around the town of Paradise.
In the Sierra Nevada and across California in late summer and early fall this year, firefighters and residents fought a losing battle against impossibly fast and ferocious blazes.
It was the state’s worst wildfire season on record. By the end of it, the flames had killed 31 people, destroyed or damaged more than 10,000 buildings and burned a staggering 4.1m acres. The North Complex fire was responsible for more than 300,000 acres of scorched land, killing 16 people in its wake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wildfires,"California's Wildfires Have Become Bigger, Deadlier, and More Costly. Here's Why","Large wildfires raging throughout California have claimed at least 44 lives statewide, destroyed thousands of structures and prompted hundreds of thousands to evacuate. A fire actively burning in Northern California took at least 42 lives, becoming the deadliest fire on state record.
Large fires have scorched populated areas of California over the past week, including the Camp Fire, north of Sacramento, which incinerated the entire town of Paradise, and the Woolsey Fire, which burns northwest of Los Angeles. Firefighters on Monday also battled the Rocky Peak fire, which sprung up near where the Woolsey fire began and forced the shutdown of the Route 118 freeway. The Camp Fire has become one of California’s most destructive fires in at least a century, according to the Associated Press.
Wildfires are a natural and annual occurrence in California, typically appearing toward the end of the long, dry summers. In four out of five cases, people provide the igniting spark. At the same time, the environment has also become more flammable. As the state grows hotter and increasingly subject to prolonged droughts, and as more people live in high risk areas, the fires simply get bigger, more severe and more costly to put out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thousands of weary firefighters, who have been battling wildfires for a month, have been fighting nearly 100 blazes in New South Wales state.
The mega fire north of Sydney, Australia‘s largest city, was created on Friday when several fires merged and was now burning across 335,000 hectares.
“We need flooding rain to put these fires out. That’s really what is going to stop it,” said the New South Wales Rural Fire Service. “These will take many weeks to put out.”
Wildfires are common in Australia during the hot summer, which begins in December, but this year the fires started much earlier, blamed on soaring temperatures, dry winds and arson.
A three-year drought has left much of Australia tinder dry.
The fires around Sydney have been pumping such vast amounts of smoke into the air that they appear as significant rain on the radars, the Bureau of Meteorology said on Twitter.
New South Wales Health said late on Friday that some 1,140 people had sought medical assistance for breathing issues or asthma in the past week _ a quarter more than in a typical week. NSW Ambulance fielded about a third more calls.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the blaze as “a catastrophe, the likes of which we have not yet known”.
He appealed to Russia, Cyprus, Greece and Italy for help in putting out the fire, which began on the slopes of the Carmel hill, southeast of Israel’s port city of Haifa, and rapidly spread.
Cyprus and Greece agreed to dispatch firefighting helicopters.
Some nine hours after the blaze was estimated to have begun exhausted firefighters, those from Haifa reinforced by teams from all over Israel, and by soldiers, were still struggling to bring it under control, but without success.
“We’ve lost control of the fire,” a spokesman for Haifa’s firefighting services was quoted as saying.
Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovich said it was impossible to say when the fire could be brought under control. However, firefighters were speculated that as the fire spread west a major road linking Haifa with Tel Aviv to the south could act as a natural firebreak, or, failing that, the sea would.
At least 22 people were confirmed dead, but other accounts put the number as high as 40.
The fatalities were prison guards who had been drafted to help evacuate the 500 prisoners from a jail in the path of the flames. Their bus, with 50 people on board, was trapped by a falling tree and 40 of them burned to death. The others were injured.

“Anybody, whether they’re businesses, whether they’re residences, camping or anything else, everybody has been evacuated from the area,” said Bureau of Land Management spokeswoman Cass Cairns.
By Monday evening, winds with gusts of 20 mph to 30 mph had pushed the fire northeast from the intersection of U.S. 50 and Colorado 9 over 700 acres. Smoke and poor visibility closed U.S. 50 6 miles west of Ca?on City.
The Fremont County Sheriff’s Office called 177 businesses and residents asking them to evacuate. Cairns said it was unclear how many structures had burned or whether any were homes.
Smoke from the fire burning in an area known as Parkdale could be seen and smelled in Colorado Springs on Monday night.
The National Weather Service issued a red flag warning for the region, advising that strong winds and relatively low humidity might cause the fire to spread.
About 50 firefighters were battling the fire on the ground, supported by a fleet of aircraft dropping flame retardant, Cairns said. These included one large air tanker, a single-engine plane, a large helicopter and a smaller helicopter.
Mike Bandera, general manager of the Royal Gorge Bridge, said the historic bridge was not threatened but that homes along Fremont County Road 61 were evacuated.
Bandera said he first saw the flames about 1:30 p.m. Monday, jumping as high as 20 feet into the air.
Overnight, firefighters will continue to monitor the blaze and create fire breaks to minimize the spread. They will fight the fire depending on the direction it is headed, how active it is and on firefighter safety, Cairns said.

""Comments from bankers noted widespread negative impacts of the dry conditions -- low or nonexistent yields for many dryland crops, stress to irrigated crops and very poor pasture conditions,"" the bank said in its second-quarter survey of credit conditions.
The Dallas Fed also noted that many ranchers are sending their cattle to the slaughterhouse earlier than they normally would, pressured by bone-dry pastureland.
""Respondents in several regions mentioned that farmers will likely collect crop insurance money to offset drought losses,"" the bank said. ""There were numerous reports of ranchers liquidating their cattle herds due to inadequate grazing conditions and a lack of surface water.""

wildfires,,"The province is escalating the fight against an out-of-control wildfire threatening Zama City in northwest Alberta.
""We do have a Type 1 team mobilizing to the site,"" said Heather Hawkins with Sustainable Resource Development. ""They are the most experienced and most well trained fire managers.""
The fire is estimated at more than 100,000 hectares, but heavy smoke makes it difficult to be more precise, she said.
Firefighters are holding a fire about 10 kilometres from the oil and gas hamlet of Zama City, about 930 kilometres northwest of Edmonton.
About 130 people were evacuated from their homes to hotels and a school in High Level, Alta., late Tuesday night when winds picked up and began pushing the fire south towards the hamlet.
""The high pressure ridge that was sitting over northern Alberta started to break down which means we had some strong winds start to pick up,"" said SRD spokesperson Rob Harris. ""That's what really fanned the fires.""
SRD recommended the hamlet evacuate immediately and Mackenzie County agreed to issue a mandatory evacuation order, he said.
Zama resident Janet Hackett said she got a sense around 4 p.m. Tuesday that people would have to leave. The family had their bags packed and ready to go when the evacuation order was issued.
""The town was becoming really, really smoky, and the skies were really red and grey, so we knew that it was getting pretty intense,"" she said.
The family then drove along a dirt road for two hours to reach High Level.

wildfires,,"Wildfires, peat fires and controlled burns on farming lands kill 339,000 people worldwide each year, said a study released on Saturday that is the first to estimate a death toll for landscape fires.
Most of those deaths are concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa, where an estimated 157,000 people die as a result of being exposed to such fires annually, with southeast Asia ranking second with 110,000 deaths.
""I was surprised at our estimate being so high when you consider that the exposure to fire smoke is quite intermittent for most people,"" said lead author Fay Johnston of the University of Tasmania.
""Even in southeast Asia and Africa, (fire) is a seasonal phenomenon. It is not year round,"" Johnston said at the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting in Vancouver where she presented her research.
The study, which Johnston said was the first of its kind to attempt to estimate a death toll from wildfires and landscape burns, was published Saturday in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives.
Researchers looked at the number of deaths from all causes in areas that were exposed to heavy smoke and landscape fire between 1997 and 2006.
They used satellite data and chemical transport models to assess the health impacts of particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers, a major byproduct of landscape fire smoke.
The number of deaths from wildfires came in far below the previously estimated global tolls for indoor air pollution at two million people per year and urban air pollution at 800,000.
However, the study authors said their findings indicated that ""fire emissions are an important contributor to global mortality.""
The research also suggested a significant link between climate and fire mortality.
About twice as many people died during El Nino years when the surface ocean temperature rises in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean (averaging 532,000) as during cooler La Nina years (averaging 262,000).",https://phys.org/news/2012-02-wildfires-people-year.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This year, officials believe target shooting or other firearms use have sparked at least 21 wildfires in Utah and nearly a dozen in Idaho. Shooting is also believed to have caused fires in Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico.
Officials have been asking the public to scale back shooting as legions of firefighters contend with one of the busiest and most destructive wildfire seasons to ever hit the West.
But many in the region avid proponents of the Second Amendment right to bear arms, so most state lawmakers are hesitant to enact any formal restrictions.
""We're not trying to pull away anyone's right to bear arms. I want to emphasize that,"" said Louinda Downs, a county commissioner in fire-prone Davis County, Utah. ""We're just saying, target practice in winter. Target practice on the gun range.

wildfires,,"A wildfire is burning out of control on North Mountain in Pendleton County in the Monongahela National Forest. More than 80 foresters and local firefighters are battling the blaze that started on Sunday near Upper Tract.
“[The fire] started on private land and it’s moved west/northwest on to national forest land, southwest of Petersburg,” according to Sarah Hankens with the U.S. Forest Service.
The blaze is 20 percent contained. It’s being called the North Mountain Fire and so far has destroyed 720 acres.
Bob Beanblossom with the U.S. Forest Service said crews are having a hard time reaching some parts of the fire because of the terrain in the Potomac Highlands.
“It is steep, rocky terrain. There are a lot of standing, dead trees that firefighters have to be careful of. It does certainly pose some hazards.” Beanblossom said half the battle is reaching those remote areas.
The fire is so large, the U.S. Forest Service has called in crews from out west.
“We have a lot of folks here from the Monongahela National Forest but there are crews from as far west as Oregon, Idaho and Washington,” explained Beanblossom.
Even more foresters are set to arrive from Tennessee, Virginia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Wisconsin.
Most of the fire is contained within the national forest and that’s where crews want to keep it.
“There is private property adjacent to the forest, not too far from where the fire is located,” said Hankens. “We do have personnel out on the fire line assessing both direct and indirect ways to create fire lines to try and keep the fire on national forest.”
So far, that part of Pendleton County has not seen any of the rain or snow much of the state received Tuesday morning.

The fire continued to move east on Highway 32 throughout the night and into Friday morning.
Increased winds from the southeast pushed the fire over Highway 32 where another section of land, just west of Council Bluff Lake, was devastated, forcing the highway’s closure. It has been closed from highway 49 south to Route A.
Council Bluffs campground is still open as of press time, but may be difficult to get to, and the campground could be closed if it becomes necessary.
""What is really driving this fire is low humidity and high temperatures. This creates a situation where the fire is actually pushing itself. It is essentially creating its own wind.

This image, taken on March 7, 2014, by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Aqua satellite, shows fires outlined in red. The fires burn in peat forests, which produce dense smoke when they burn. Fire detections from the MODIS sensors on both the Aqua and Terra satellites play a significant role in monitoring burning in Indonesia. This image shows around 400 fire detections, meaning that MODIS detected at least one fire in about 400 one-kilometer pixels.
According to local news reports, some of the more intense fires are burning in the Giam Siak Kecil-Bukit Batu biosphere reserve and were deliberately set to clear land for palm oil plantations. The Giam Siak Kecil-Bukit Batu biosphere reserve contains just over 700,000 hectares of peat forest that sustains a wide range of plant and animal species including the Sumatra tiger, elephant, tapir, and sun bear.
It is illegal to set fires to clear land in Indonesia, but the practice is common. The chief of the Indonesian National Disaster Mitigation Agency told ANTARA News that 99 percent of the fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan were deliberately set. Most fires occur during the dry season between April and October.

Intense wildfires have been surging across southern and northern California with little reprieve for firefighters or residents for several weeks. The intensity of the flames has increased because of the sudden heat wave sweeping into peak wildfire season. Last week fires burned over 250 acres across the Sierra Nevada foothills, and over 70,000 acres have been burned east of Sacramento by what’s being called the King fire, forcing thousands to flee their homes.

Here, we take a close-up look at five of these numbers: where they come from, and whether they're for real.

wildfires,,"Nearly three billion animals _ mammals, reptiles, birds, and frogs _ were killed or displaced by Australia’s devastating 2019-20 bushfires.
It’s almost three times an earlier estimate released in January.
The breakdown is 143 million mammals, 2.46 billion reptiles, 180 million birds, and 51 million frogs.
Those figures are revealed in an interim report entitled Australia’s 2019-2020 Bushfires: The Wildlife Toll, commissioned by the World Wide Fund for Nature and believed to be world first research.
Ten scientists from the University of Sydney, University of New South Wales, University of Newcastle, Charles Sturt University, and BirdLife Australia contributed the majority of the work.
The project is being led by Dr Lily Van Eeden and overseen by Professor Chris Dickman, both from the University of Sydney.
While results are still being finalised, the headline figure of nearly three billion animals impacted is unlikely to change.
“The interim findings are shocking. It’s hard to think of another event anywhere in the world in living memory that has killed or displaced that many animals. This ranks as one of the worst wildlife disasters in modern history,” said WWF-Australia CEO Dermot O’Gorman.
“When you think about nearly three billion native animals being in the path of the fires it is absolutely huge, it’s a difficult number to comprehend,” said Professor Dickman.
While the scientists cannot say how many animals died, Professor Dickman said the prospects for animals which escaped the flames were “probably not that great” because of a lack of food and shelter or being forced into habitat already occupied.
In January, Professor Dickman, working with WWF scientists, produced an early estimate that 1.25 billion animals were impacted. However, that calculation focused only on the states of New South Wales and Victoria.
Dr Van Eeden said for this project the team examined a fire impact area of 11.46 million hectares.
“We believe a continent-wide assessment of the number of animals that might be impacted has never been done in Australia before or anywhere else in the world. Other nations can build upon this research to improve understanding of bushfire impacts everywhere,” Dr Van Eeden said.
Mr O’Gorman said with extreme fires becoming more frequent because of climate change the interim findings “give other countries a window into the future of mega fires and their devastating impact on wildlife”.
He said the research had also been released in time to be considered by the review of Australia’s flagship environment law _ the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act.
“Following such a heavy toll on Australia’s wildlife, strengthening this law has never been more important. WWF will continue to advocate for policies that benefit both people and nature, restore what has been lost, and ensure we build back a more resilient Australia,” Mr O’Gorman said.
Professor Dickman said the research shows people that mega fires are changing the environment and depleting native biodiversity and change is necessary.
“How quickly can we decarbonise? How quickly can we stop our manic land clearing? We land clear at a rate that’s one of the highest in the world,” Professor Dickman said.
The recommendations in the interim report call for addressing knowledge gaps on wildlife densities and responses to fire, improving habitat connectivity to help mobile species escape fire, identifying and protecting unburnt habitat crucial to threatened species, improving fire prevention and management, and establishing rapid response teams to help species impacted by fire.

wildfires,,"In the wake of the enormous fires that have razed huge swathes of drought-stricken Australia, scientists fear that when rains eventually fall, they will wash charred debris into rivers, dams, and the ocean, killing wildlife and even tainting the drinking supplies of major cities, such as Sydney.
For many weeks, ash, soot, and blackened gum tree leaves have collected along the shorelines of Sydney’s beaches, clogging the waves and lapping in the tide. Originating in fires blazing in forested areas to the west, the debris has been carried on the breeze along with the pungent bushfire smoke that blanketed Australia’s largest city for much of December.
But what has carried on the wind is just a taste of the huge quantities of debris that are likely to wash into rivers once there are heavy downpours. As of press time, more than 26 million acres—an area bigger than Portugal—have now burned, mostly in the continent’s southeast. That includes areas of land known as catchments—also called watersheds—where rainfall begins its earthly journey into specific rivers, lakes, and dams.
It is an ecological disaster unprecedented in Australia’s history, and that spells trouble for drinking water supplies, coastal ecosystems, and the freshwater rivers that support iconic Australian wildlife, such as the platypus.

Climate scientists are currently examining data from the disaster, which destroyed swathes of southeastern Australia, to determine to what extent they can be attributed to rising temperatures.
In a special edition of the journal Nature Climate Change, Australian researchers examined several other aspects of the blazes, including investigations into their extent and possible causes.
One study showed that between September 2019 and January 2020 around 5.8 million hectares of broadleaf forest were burned in New South Wales and Victoria.
This accounts for roughly 21 percent of the nation's forested area, making this fire season proportionately the most devastating on record.

The number of forest fires in Brazil's Amazon rainforest increased 28% in July in comparison to last year, the country's National Institute for Space Research reported Saturday.
Brazil holds around 60% of the Amazon basin region and environmentalists say this area is vital to containing the impact of climate change.
The state agency recorded 6,803 fires in the Amazon last month, compared to 5,318 in the same month of 2019.
Environmentalists were alarmed by the figure, particularly because August traditionally marks the beginning of the fire season in the region. Many now fear that a repeat of the large surge in fires that devastated the area last August could occur this year again.

Satellites in September recorded 32,017 hotspots in the world’s largest rainforest, a 61% rise from the same month in 2019.
In August last year, surging fires in the Amazon captured global headlines and prompted criticism from world leaders such as France’s Emmanuel Macron that Brazil was not doing enough to protect the rainforest.
On Tuesday, the US Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, called for a world effort to offer $20bn to end Amazon deforestation and threatened Brazil with unspecified “economic consequences” if it did not “stop tearing down the forest”.
President Jair Bolsonaro lambasted Biden’s comment as a “cowardly threat” to Brazil’s sovereignty and a “clear sign of contempt”.
Data from Inpe released on Thursday showed that in 2019, fires spiked in August and declined considerably the month after, but this year’s peak has been more sustained. Both August and September of 2020 have matched or surpassed last year’s single-month high.
“We have had two months with a lot of fire. It’s already worse than last year,” said Ane Alencar, science director for Brazil’s Amazon Environmental Research Institute (Ipam).
“It could get worse if the drought continues. We are at the mercy of the rain.”
The Amazon is experiencing a more severe dry season than last year, which scientists attribute in part to warming in the tropical North Atlantic Ocean pulling moisture away from South America.
The entire Amazon, which spans nine countries, currently has 28,892 active fires, according to a fire monitoring tool funded in part by the US space agency, Nasa.
The fires in September are not only burning recently deforested areas and farmland, where ranchers set them to clear land, but are also increasingly burning virgin forest, a worrying trend that suggests the rainforest is becoming drier and more prone to fire.
Roughly 62% of major Amazon fires were in forests in September, compared with only 15% in August, according to an analysis of satellite images by the US-based non-profit Amazon Conservation.
The warming of the North Atlantic is also helping drive drought in the Brazilian Pantanal, the world’s largest wetland, which has suffered more fires this year than ever previously recorded, according to Inpe data.
A Federal University of Rio de Janeiro analysis found that 23% of the wetlands, which are home to the densest population of jaguars in the world, has burned.

wildfires,,"Fires continue to rage at high levels through the Amazon in Brazil for the second consecutive year, raising concerns among scientists that the rainforest's destruction could eventually reach a point of no return.
Since Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro took office, governmental measures to curb illegal fires have shown little impact, as flames and deforestation erase vast swathes of the world's biggest rainforest.
Most fires in the Amazon are set by land-grabbers and wildcat ranchers, seeking to transform parts of the rainforest into their own lucrative agricultural enterprises. And this August was a particularly bad time for such fires: Preliminary data collected by the National Spatial Research Institute (INPE) show 29,307 fires in the Brazilian Amazon last month.
However, due to a technical issue with the NASA satellite tracking fires, experts say that figure could be even higher. The final tally of fires recorded in August is expected to rise 2% above the August 2019 total, says Albert Setzer, INPE's senior scientist -- which would make this August the worst in 10 years.
The more fires there are, the faster the rainforest is transformed into grasslands for illicit cattle and soy-growing operations.

Thanks to a recovery program that began in 1995, their numbers in the wild increased from 150 to 400. Scientists responded by downgrading the birds’ status from critically endangered with extinction to just endangered.
But that all changed in January. Now this bird is part of an unfolding horror story.
Fires have raged across nearly 50 percent of Kangaroo Island. That’s their 4,400-square-kilometer (1,700-square-mile) isle off the coast of the state of South Australia. Flames destroyed the habitat for most of the birds. It’s unclear how many glossy black cockatoos survived. For those that did, food may now be scarce. These birds eat the seeds of a single tree species: the drooping she oak.
Many years of hard work to save these birds have gone up in smoke, says Daniella Teixeira. She’s a conservation biologist who works 2,184 kilometers (some 1,360 miles) away at Australia’s University of Queensland in Brisbane. This fire has brought “a big step backwards for the recovery team,” Teixeira concludes. And it’s something she understands well. She has studied and worked to protect these cockatoos for the last four years. Even if just one in every four of the birds died, she says, this subspecies could again be deemed critically endangered with extinction.

Last year, more than 1 million hectares of forest were burned, and the trend shows the destruction is far from over. Last June, more than two thousand fire hotspots were registered in the Amazon, the highest number in the last thirteen years. Since Brazil’s President Bolsonaro took office in January 2019, his government’s agenda has been very clear: dismantle environmental protection law and agencies, so that forest destroyers can burn the forest freely, clearing the land to turn it into pastures, without being held accountable. 
The consequences of this destruction are dire. From Siberia to the Amazon, fires are raging across the world. Losing our forests means losing the fight against the climate crisis, putting biodiversity at risk of extinction, and threatening the lives of Indigenous Peoples who depend on the forest standing for their survival. Fighting to protect the forest and Indigenous lands from fires and deforestation become even more difficult—and crucial —during a pandemic. 
With a mortality rate from COVID-19 150% higher than the Brazilian average, Indigenous Peoples are already more vulnerable during the pandemic. The smoke from the fires will put their respiratory system at even higher risk during a time when access to healthcare is limited in remote areas in the Amazon.
But things can be different. After the public’s outcry last year, there is increasing pressure on Brazil’s government. Investors, companies and governments have been signaling their concerns about the destruction of the forest and its impact on the environment, and their message is clear: they don’t want to do business with forest destroyers. Even though last week Bolsonaro announced a “fire moratorium” for 120 days, the images of Mato Grosso show how his measures have been performative and inefficient.",https://www.greenpeace.org/international/story/44159/fires-brazil-bolsonaro-amazon-deforestation-2020/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wildfires,,"The number of fires in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest jumped 28% in July from a year ago, official data showed on Saturday, as some environmentalists warned a jump this week could signal a repeat of last year’s surging destruction of the world’s largest rainforest.
Brazil’s space research agency Inpe recorded 6,803 fires in the Amazon last month, up from 5,318 in July 2019.
Although that is a three-year high for July, the figure pales in comparison to last year’s peak of 30,900 fires in August _ a nine-year high for that month.
Still, environmental groups say there are worrying signs of what may come, with the final days of the month showing a sharp spike. More than 1,000 fires were registered on July 30, the highest number for a single day in July since 2005, according to an analysis by advocacy group Greenpeace Brasil.
“It’s a terrible sign,” said Ane Alencar, science director at Brazil’s Amazon Environmental Research Institute (IPAM). “We can expect that August will already be a difficult month and September will be worse yet.”Environmental advocates blame right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro for emboldening illegal loggers, miners and land speculators to destroy the forest with his vision of economic development for the region. Bolsonaro defends his plans to introduce mining and farming in protected reserves as a way to lift the region out of poverty.
This year, the president authorized a military deployment from May to November to combat deforestation and forest fires. He has also banned setting fires in the region for 120 days.
In 2019, Brazil instituted the same temporary policies later in the year, only after fires in the Amazon provoked global outcry in August.
Scientists say the rainforest is a vital defense against climate warming because it absorbs greenhouse gases.
Non-government organization Amazon Conservation says it has tracked 62 major fires for the year as of July 30. Many of those came after July 15, when the fire ban went into affect, indicating it has not been entirely effective, said Matt Finer, who leads the NGO’s fire tracking project.
The overwhelming majority of large fires, where elevated levels of aerosols in the smoke indicate large amounts of burning biomass, happened in recently deforested areas, with none found in virgin forest, Finer said.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-environment-idUSKBN24X3SW,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wildfires,,"Cool and relatively moist, Swedish summers aren’t known for promoting wildfire. Fires occur in most years, but not on the scale or intensity of the blaze that raged through boreal forests in August 2014.
It’s not clear how it got started, but fast-growing fire has consumed V?stmanland since July 31. In a week, the blaze grew to become the largest Sweden has seen in four decades. As of August 8, it had charred more than 150 square kilometers (60 square miles), killed one person, and forced thousands to evacuate their homes.
The Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat 8 captured this natural-color image of the fire on August 4, 2014. Multiple smoke plumes rise from the perimeter of the fire and blow northwest in the wind. Burned forest appears brown; unaffected forests are dark green; farmland is light green; and fallow fields are tan.
Hot and dry weather exacerbated the fire, stressing vegetation and priming it to burn. With a high-pressure system parked over Scandinavia, oppressive heat emerged across Sweden in July and August, bringing record or near-record temperatures to many towns and cities. In Sala, a city close to the fire, temperatures soared to 34.7°C (94.5°F) on August 5. Average temperatures are about 70°F (21°C) in early August.
Wildfires aren’t common or widespread in Sweden. According to a report published by the International Forest Fire News, only a few hundred hectares (100 hectares is equivalent to 1 square kilometer) generally burn during the nation’s wet summers, and a few thousand hectares burn during dry summers. That’s less than 0.02 percent of Sweden’s overall forest cover.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Flaming tule reeds, eight to 10 feet high, burned over a boggy marsh filled with three to four feet of water. Firefighters relied on catwalks to get to the flames, but when the catwalks caught fire they had to slog through the marsh.
The Pittsburg power plant is currently non-operational. So there was no threat of a major power outage. The real threat came from transmission lines above.
""The PG&E transmission lines contain high voltage and in some cases smoke and particulate matter burning from fires can cause arcing between the lines and down to the ground, and that was a concern,"" said Laing.
Willow Pass Road was closed for about two hours preventing people from getting to work and home.
""Last summer we had the other side of the road catch on fire and we had pretty much the same situation and we were stuck out here. It was around the Fourth of July,"" said Steve Sebastian, a truck driver.
But that was July when vegetation is expected to be dry.
""We're all surprised at aggressive fire behavior that causes a three-alarm fire in the tules in March. We're concerned about the kind of fire behavior we're going to get this summer,"" said Laing.
This fire consumed a lot of fresh green grass and by July it'll all be dead, so another fire like this could spread a lot faster and jump the roads. Investigators are still trying to figure out the cause of this fire.

wildfires,,"The amount of land burned by wildfires in the U.S. this year has surpassed 9 million acres, according to data released Thursday by the National Interagency Fire Center.
This is only the fourth time on record the country has reached the 9 million-acre mark, center spokesman Randall Eardley said in an e-mail. The area burned is roughly equivalent to the size of New Jersey and Connecticut combined.
All of the top years for acres burned have occurred since 2000, Eardley said. The worst year occurred in 2006, with 9.8 million acres. In 2007 and 2012, 9.3 million acres were burned, he said. If another 800,000 acres are burned this year, an all-time record would be set.
Accurate wildfire records go back to 1960. Prior to 2000, the U.S. surpassed 7 million acres only one time — in 1963. ""The year 2000 seems to have been a turning point in the number of acres we've seen burned,"" Eardley said.

wildfires,,"There was a time when fire season in California started around May and went through September. Now, thanks to a drought that’s stretching into its fourth year, the state seems to have become a year-round tinderbox.
The long running drought has “created explosive fire conditions,” said Mike Mohler, a fire captain with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE). “Five years ago without a drought in California you would still get wildland fires. But the vegetation wouldn’t burn as quickly. Now there’s zero moisture and you get explosive fire growth.”
The drought has fed into a trend that’s been developing for over the past decade, said Daniel Berlant, chief of public information for CAL FIRE.
“Since 2000 we’ve been seeing larger and more damaging fires,” he said. “What we’re seeing now is that the rain is starting later and stopping much earlier. The fires are burning at explosive speed because the vegetation is so dry and that allows them to get much larger.”
It’s not just the low precipitation that’s the problem, Berlant says. It’s also the higher temperatures.
Those high temperatures are baking the moisture out of the soil and air, leaving vegetation especially dry and vulnerable to catching fire, said Park Williams, an assistant research professor at the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University.
Rising temperatures alone can boost the risk of wildfires, Williams said. “When you see wildfires in the Sierra Nevada and Northern Coast Ranges occurring early in the season it’s a testament to how warm conditions have become in spring,” he adds.
In a recent study published in the International Journal of Wildland Fire, Williams found that, in the Southwest, rising temperatures raised fire risk even in wetter years. That finding is likely to hold true for California, too, he said.
“Forests are excellent gauges of climate because they are not irrigated and they live for a very long time, allowing for tree-ring records and other aspects of forests to tell us how recent conditions fit into a long-term context,” Williams said. “As temperatures rise, the amount of water necessary to reduce a forest’s flammability goes up. In the absence of substantial increases in precipitation, warming causes increased flammability, and that very reliably translates to increased areas of forest burned.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The explosive Valley fire, which broke out in Lake County on Saturday, has overwhelmed firefighters who have scrambled to keep up with its unpredictable nature. Consuming 62,000 acres -- about 97 square miles _ it prompted the local sheriff to declare it the worst tragedy the area had ever seen.
The rain that fell Monday afternoon appeared to be a sign of reprieve, but fire officials warned that that was not the case.
“The reality is that a fire burning this hot, the falling rain never even makes it to the ground,” said Doug Pittman, a Cal Fire spokesman. “It’s vaporized before it gets to the fire.”
Pittman added that the landscape has become so desiccated that its response to water, even if sprayed directly on grass and trees, is minimal. A shift in other elements -- such as an increase in humidity or a decrease in wind speed -- would actually be more helpful.
The drop in temperature, however, has at least made conditions more comfortable for the 1,800 firefighters on the scene.
“We’ll take any and all precipitation that we can get,” Pittman said.

The peak for California’s wildfires is usually summer into early fall, intensifying by late-September or October due to Santa Ana and Diablo winds, weather.com senior meteorologist Jon Erdman explained in an earlier story. The threat typically diminishes in the winter, which is considered the region's ""wet"" time of year, because of growing mountain snowpack and returning moisture. 
But during the last two winter seasons, the rain and mountain snow totals in the region were well below average. The lack of moisture is no more apparent anywhere else than it is in the California's Sierra Nevada mountain range, where snowpack has plunged to record lows.

wildfires,,"How much do you really know about wildfires in California? The Western U.S. is enduring an unprecedented fire year, and one thing's clear: the fires we face today are different from the fires of the 19th and 20th Centuries.
From public health in the smoke plume to remote-controlled hobby aircraft interfering with firefighting efforts to instant access to information via social media, life in fire country is ever changing.
Here are ten important facts about wildfires in the Golden State. How many did you know?
There are two distinct wildfire seasons in California: ones driven by Santa Ana winds (usually October to April) and ones generally exacerbated by heat in the summer months (usually June to September). Santa Ana fires spread more quickly, while non-Santa Ana fires spread more slowly and are considered less intense, though they can burn longer.
Climate change will probably worsen wildfires, but wildfires can also make climate change worse. When undisturbed, forests and wildlands capture and store millions of tons of carbon from the atmosphere in California; wildfires release carbon back into the atmosphere, exacerbating climate change. An April 2015 study by the National Park Service and UC Berkeley, published in Forest Ecology and Management, showed that five to seven percent of carbon emissions between 2001 and 2010 came from wildfires.
Look forward to more burned-over landscapes in California. A September 2015 paper published in Environmental Research Letters by scientists from the University of California predicts that California land burned by wildfires will increase in the coming decades. By comparing temperature, wind, and relative humidity in the present climate with projections from five different global climate models, they are able to project that area burned by Santa Ana fires will increase by 64 percent; and the area burned by non-Santa Ana fires will increase by 77 percent. Factors that point to this increase: an increase in more intense Santa Ana winds and an increase in temperatures, both due to climate change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

wildfires,,"Three factors influence the impact of wildfire risk on property losses: fuel, slope, and access. The primary risk factor is a property’s proximity to vegetation—grass, trees, and scrub or brush—which provides fuel for a fire. Another important factor is topography, or slope, which influences the speed of wildfire spread. Finally, access—or specifically lack of access—is a critical factor. We’ve learned through experience that when properties are on dead-end streets or in single-access neighborhoods, firefighters face added challenges.
In addition to examining those risk factors, our analysis also considered time-dependent, weather-related factors. California experienced extreme drought conditions this past summer, with hardly any rainfall, and we found that to be significant. We also looked at wind patterns.
Even before the Valley and Butte fires erupted, our assessment had placed a large number of properties destroyed or damaged in their wake at high risk based on location and vegetation risk factors. Our modeling also established the Valley and Butte locations as areas with high loss potential before the fires, as illustrated by the map to the right.
As illustrated on the maps below, in both fires we found a significant correlation between burn severity and the proximity of vegetative fuel. As we see more frequently, people are building homes and other structures in the California foothills, former wildlands dominated by vegetation. In such an environment, or wildland-urban interface (or intermix, depending upon proximity to wildland fuels), properties are at a higher risk for loss.
A good number of properties destroyed or damaged in the Valley and Butte fires were located on steep slopes—and steeper slopes can increase the speed and intensity of wildfire. Winds also played a role. We detected anomalous wind patterns, with wind gusts in the area of 30 miles per hour, in both the Valley and Butte fires. Those winds had a role in spreading the fires and making it difficult for firefighters to control the flames. The Valley and Butte wind patterns, however, didn’t approach the magnitude of the infamous 60-mile-per-hour Santa Ana winds, responsible for fanning California’s most devastating wildfires.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wildfires,,"Wildfires can cause overwhelming stress: The red-orange hues beyond the plumes of smoke seemed so far away, but now threaten the only place some have ever called home. Communities of people told they're not in danger one moment are put on high alert the next. There's not always time to grab family photos, your grandmother's ring or your beloved pets. It only takes a few minutes for fires to grow at an incomprehensible velocity, forcing people out of their homes, says Scott Vest, spokesman for the Red Cross' Ogden, Utah, Northern Chapter. He was stationed in Middletown, California, which is about two hours north of San Francisco, for about two weeks _ just days after emergency officials announced on Sept. 15 that 23,000 people had been displaced by wildfires in Northern California this year. More than 300,000 acres have burned in California so far in 2015, and the fires continue.
“When everything has been destroyed and all you have is a pile of ashes, you don’t really have anything to hold on to,” Vest says.
The notion that there's a specific wildfire season is a thing of the past, says Merritt Schreiber, an associate professor of clinical emergency medicine and director of psychological programs at the Center for Disaster Medical Sciences at the University of California—Irvine Medical Center and School of Medicine_. ""The last few years, fire season has become all year long. It's seriously aggravated by the drought, and the drought is a big stressor in the area,"" says Schreiber, who's also director for pediatric trauma psychology consultation services _there.
When Distress Gets Serious
Grant Marshall, a senior behavioral scientist at the RAND Corporation in Santa Monica, California, has focused his research on trauma resulting from wildfires and other disasters. In August, he and other researchers published a study in EcoHealth that examined the psychological distress faced by 1,387 of the 6,000 households displaced by wildfires that burned 733 square miles in Apache County, Arizona, from May through June 2011.
""We found relatively high rates _ 35 percent _ of people who were still experiencing emotional distress that could be indicative of a mental health problem even months after the event took place,"" Marshall says.
Those experiencing such an event might feel more irritable, nervous or anxious or even depressed, Vest says._ They might have detailed memories of the evacuation or witnessing the fire raging toward their community.
Schreiber adds there are two trajectories people tend to take when they've experienced a wildfire or similar disaster that displaces them: distress with resilience and distress without resilience.
""Many people have distress, and many people who have distress are going to have resilience. They're going to bounce back to how they were doing before in a relatively short period of time,"" Schreiber explains, adding that the other group who can't seem to deal may have a greater risk for developing a condition such as _depression or post-traumatic stress disorder.

wildfires,,"Alaska, the great northern frontier of America, is being reshaped by climate change. While rising temperatures are altering its character and landscape, they are also bringing the ravages of wildfires.
In the past 60 years, Alaska has warmed more than twice as fast as the rest of the country, with average temperatures up by nearly 3°F. By 2050, temperatures are projected to climb an additional 2-4 degrees, with the Arctic region seeing the most dramatic increases. These rising temperatures are expected to increase wildfire risks in Alaska, just as they have in the rest of the western U.S.Wildfires have been on the rise across the western U.S. since the 1970s, at the same time that spring and summer temperatures have increased dramatically, and average spring snowpack has declined substantially.
Fires in Alaska don’t often make news in the lower 48, but they threaten vast expanses of forest, parkland, and tundra that store immense quantities of carbon. The state’s growing number of large wildfires have the potential to damage these ecosystems, and the people and wildlife that depend on them, while releasing a significant amount of carbon into the atmosphere, further contributing to global warming.

The Associated Press reported that 314 wildfires remained active over more than 2,265 square miles as of Monday. No new evacuations occurred this past weekend, however residents in some small communities left in voluntary evacuations last week, including elders, children and those that were medically vulnerable.
Most of the fires in June 2004 were located in Alaska's interior, while this June they have been scattered throughout the state, Alaska DNR said. They added that it was unusual to have this concentration of fire starts.
Lightning strikes were a major contributor to the ignition of wildfires in both June 2015 and June 2004. However, Alaska DNR says that June 2015 has had much more lightning than June 2004. In a span of three days from June 21-23, 2015, about 50,000 lightning strikes were recorded across the state.

wildfires,,"One of the state’s worst wildfire seasons in history has scorched 5 million acres of tundra and forests across Alaska, and experts here fear climate change will cause even more devastating fires through a combination of lower snowpack, drying tundra and melting permafrost.
Like an insulating blanket, snow reduces fire risk by keeping trees and grasses cold and damp. If less snow accumulates, or worse, snow covers less of the state than normal, there will be nothing to stop the near-constant summer sun from drying out the tundra and the permafrost layer below it. Permafrost, which is mostly composed of organic material, burns easily once thawed and lightning strikes.
Anchorage, for example, had its least snowy winter on record, with just over two feet of snow, the National Weather Service reported.
“We’re looking at, potentially over time, more fires burning more area,” said Kent Slaughter, the manager of the federal Bureau of Land Management’s Alaska Fire Service.

At the height of the fire season in early July, Slaughter and his teams were battling two wildfires that were each nearly three times bigger than any blaze in the rest of the country.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wildfires,,"More and more of Alaska’s boreal forests are burning each year, according to a study released last week. Researchers found that the acreage of forest burned in interior Alaska has climbed almost five-fold since 1943. That increase is likely influenced by a regional shift to a warmer, drier climate, as well as by human disturbances like encroaching development and fire suppression. Researchers found that that increase was most pronounced in the region’s most populated area, where firefighting efforts are most intense.
Thanks to its size and the remoteness of much of the state, Alaska has had to take a highly targeted approach to fighting wildfires. In the 1980s, the state established four zones of fire response, depending on whether the events happen near human settlement, whether there are valuable natural resources in the area and how likely the fire is to spread. The state’s population hubs, like Anchorage and Fairbanks, are designated as “critical” zones and receive the most protection — which often means fire suppression.
In a concerning twist, the study’s authors found the steepest increase in area burned has been in the highest tiers of protection. Fairbanks, the most populated area they looked at, was the most glaring example: on average, 12.4 percent more acreage burns there each year than the previous one.  
The reasons for that increase are likely complicated and include the region’s logging history. In Fairbanks, in particular, the landscape was basically denuded in the 1900s, thanks to the gold rush. Miners cut down the region’s forests to build homes and mining infrastructure and to burn to heat the frozen soil for digging. In the 100 years since, the forests have grown back and slowly gone through their natural succession, from the relatively fireproof willows and birches to the flammable black spruce.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC), which makes predictions of the fire season for the federal government, expects the burning to continue. Wrote the agency:
“Alaska is in the heart of its fire season, and fire season could continue to be quite busy for another two months.”
The NIFC expects warmer temperatures and drier than normal conditions in the state.
Nearly one-third of all firefighters on active fires are in Alaska, according to the NIFC. More than 85 percent of acres burning are in Alaska.
According to a report from Climate Central, more fire is part of a trend: The fire season in Alaska is getting longer, the area burned is increasing and the number of large wildfires in the Arctic part of the state is growing.
Climate Central projects that the area burned in Alaska wildfires will double by mid-century.
More fires in the Arctic region are concerning to scientists because they could melt permafrost and release carbon that could accelerate global warming, said Todd Sanford, lead author of the study.
That’s because studies show wildfire can thaw permafrost beneath vegetation and soil and release sealed carbon, which could accelerate climate change though the effect is not certain.
Scientists are concerned that could create a feedback loop: More carbon in the atmosphere leading to warming temperatures, which thaws permafrost and leads to more carbon in the atmosphere.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

“There’s lots of vegetation,” Fish and Wildlife Service fire ecologist Lisa Saperstein said. “And where you have vegetation, it’s fuel.”
Tundra fires are sometimes allowed to burn out on their own if they don’t threaten infrastructure.

On Monday firefighters suppressed a fire that burned within the perimeter of the CZU Lightning Complex of fires. The blaze was in Big Basin Redwoods State Park south of San Francisco and could be a holdover from the 86,502-acre blaze from August, 2020.
When firefighters hiked into the fire it was less than two acres, but with the assistance of aircraft they stopped the spread after it burned about seven acres.

In many cases since they are within the burn perimeter, they may not be a serious problem. But if they are in a large unburned island, burning embers lofted into the air could ignite spot fires some distance away, perhaps outside the perimeter where there is an abundance of available fuel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015
wildfires,,"The Parana River in Argentina -- South America's second-biggest river after the Amazon and the eighth longest in the world -- is at its lowest level in decades this year, allowing multiple forest fires to spread through its delta.
NASA's Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat-8 captured a satellite image of the river near Rosario on July 3, 2020, showing the parched land compared to an old image taken on July 1, 2019, when water levels were high.
The Parana is South America's second-biggest river after the Amazon and the eighth longest in the world. 
As the shrinking river caused economic damage, it also allowed increased fire activity in the delta.
Giant plumes of smoke have been whipping across the region since February, and have even covered the streets of Rosario at times and other places along the Parana. As a result, the air in Rosario was unbreathable for weeks.
""The other night I walked to the river and could see seven fires burning in the distance,"" biologist Jorge Liotta told the Guardian late July.
""It depends on the wind if the smoke hits you, but when it does, the smoke is so thick that the sun turns red and you can barely see the house next door. What’s worse, it gets inside your home. People with asthma and other breathing difficulties are really suffering.”
Greenpeace Argentina spokesperson Leonel Mingo said, ""everything is burning, it's completely out of control,"" warning that once a fire reaches a certain scale, ""it becomes virtually impossible to stop.""
While the Parana River Basin was drenched by some rain in June and July, river watchers do not expect the river to fully recover until sustained wet seasonal rains come in October.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wildfires,2021,"Decreasing winds allowed more moderate activity by the Caldor Fire, but spot fires were still a major concern, said the latest report from the Forest Service’s fire managers.
The fire was estimated at 104,309 acres (163 square miles) on Sunday evening — an increase of about 14,000 acres in 24 hours.
A largest of the spot fires, about 150 acres, was burning on the north side of Highway 50 near Kyburz. An abundance of dry fuel in the densely forested area has allowed embers to flare easily into fires, the fire update said.
Since Friday, Highway 50 has been closed between Pollock Pines and Meyers. It is open between Twin Bridges and Meyers only for residents of that area.
All the evacuation orders so far are in El Dorado County, except for a very small area of Placer County near Loon Lake. Warnings have been issued in Amador County.
All of Eldorado National Forest has been closed to the public through Sept. 30.

wildfires,caldor wildfire,"Firefighters got good news from the weather on Sunday, as winds slowed down and humidity started to build, allowing crews a window to slow the dizzying-fast pace of the Caldor Fire as it closed in on 100,000 acres, officials said.
Authorities also announced the shut-down of all the national forests in Northern California to be closed late Sunday through Labor Day because of fire danger, and residents in El Dorado County were plagued by hazardous air conditions.
Highway 50 remained closed into Sunday afternoon, after the fire jumped it Saturday night. Fire officials said the highway was a key line in slowing the fire’s spread that they had hoped the fire would not cross.
By Sunday morning, the Caldor Fire had spread to 98,149 acres, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. It has been burning for eight full days and is 0% contained, and crews have new challenges awaiting them, among them the vegetation fire fuels in steep canyons and very dense forested areas that could be difficult to access, Cal Fire spokesman Capt. Stephen Horner said.
Yet, the weather is providing a break, enough so that air tankers were expected to be used.
The blaze is one of five major ones that crews are fighting in Northern California.
The largest of those, the Dixie Fire, has burned 721,298 acres and is 37% contained. Wind gusts that brought red flag conditions fueled a fast spread in the East Zone of the fire, Cal Fire said, but increased humidity overnight slowed the fire in the West Zone and may do so again Sunday.
As of Sunday morning, the Monument Fire in Trinity County had burned 147,323 acres and was 16% contained, while the McFarland Fire in Shasta, Trinity and Tehama counties had burned 117,985 acres and was 66% contained.
Authorities did not have current information on the Cache Fire on Sunday.
The wildfires caused the U.S. Forest Service to announce the closure of nine national forests, including the Tahoe National Forest and the Lake Tahoe Basin — starting at 11:59 p.m. Sunday. The parks will be closed at least through Sept. 6.
People may not visit or drive through the forests, forest service officials said. The other forests that were closed were the Plumas, Lassen, Mendocino, Klamath, Six Rivers, Shasta-Trinity and Modoc national forests.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fueled by wind and dry conditions, the fire burning in El Dorado County swelled to 62,586 acres Wednesday and is 0% contained, according to Cal Fire. The fire was sparked Saturday and the cause is unknown.
""The unfortunate thing is that these fires continue to get bigger,"" Cal Fire Director Thom Porter said Wednesday at a news conference. ""But we're surging resources into communities to protect and reduce the impact.”
The fast-moving fire continued to burn through ""several steep drainages with the aid of the large amounts of dry vegetation,"" causing even more evacuations, Cal Fire said.
California's weather has only been making matters worse for those fighting the fires, as well as the thousands who were directed to evacuate their homes.
The state's large fires remained active Wednesday thanks to a front that pushed through the area, CNN meteorologist Michael Guy said. Although temperatures will remain on the cooler side, the area is still extremely dry as drought conditions continue to grip the state.
""Any new fronts that push through will increase the winds on approach, which can be a huge problem for the firefighters,"" Guy said. ""I would say it is like waiting for a wreck to happen. ... You see it happening or coming, and all you can do is wait for the catastrophe to occur with nothing you can do about it.”
To protect people from that dire situation, the number of those evacuated in El Dorado County jumped to 16,380 Wednesday, up from about 6,850 the day prior, according to the Governor's Office of Emergency Services.
""Getting people out of the way of these fires is the best way for us to be able to protect your communities. We need you to evacuate,"" Porter urged. ""Please heed the warnings.""
Darby Flynn is one of thousands who was told to flee the flames, CNN affiliate KCRA reported.
She told the news outlet she's ""glad to be able to evacuate and not be caught in the fire.""
""I just kind of grabbed some things and some important artwork that my mom painted for me and something my aunt made for me and that was pretty much it,"" she told KCRA. ""Otherwise, I just try to remember that things are things and most of them you can replace.""
Meanwhile, two people were airlifted to hospitals after being seriously injured in the area, Cal Fire said. One person approached firefighters, who tried conducting first aid before the person was taken to a hospital. Another person suffered ""severe"" injuries.
Damage assessment has not yet begun as the fire remains dynamic and complex, officials said. So far, the fire has destroyed many structures and threatens roughly 6,000 others, Cal Fire officials said. The fire burned at least one elementary school in the Pioneer Union School District, one community church and one post office.
In Lake County, California, about 100 miles northwest of Sacramento, a new wildfire has destroyed a number of homes, officials said. The Cache Fire has burned about 80 acres and is 20% contained, according to Cal Fire.

Dozens of firefighters also faced dynamic conditions on the ground, including smoke from the nearby Dixie Fire, which has hampered air attacks.
The rapid growth of the Caldor Fire has forced 23,000 people to flee in El Dorado County as of Wednesday night, up from 6,850 on Tuesday, according to the California Governor's Office of Emergency Service. Evacuation warnings were issued for parts of Amador County, too.
A total of more than 36,000 people across multiple counties in California have been forced to evacuate as active wildfires continue to ravage the state.
Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for El Dorado County early Tuesday, mobilizing the California National Guard and freeing up additional resources for impacted communities.
Two people were flown to hospitals with serious injuries and very few homes were left standing in El Dorado County's Grizzly Flats. Streets in the town of about 1,200 residents were littered with downed power lines and poles. Houses were reduced to smoldering ash and twisted metal with only chimneys rising above the ruins. A post office and elementary school were also destroyed.

""We have a firefight ahead of us and the wind today is going to make it very challenging,"" said Keith Wade, a spokesman with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, on Saturday.
The Caldor Fire in the northern Sierra Nevada already destroyed dozens of homes, and authorities on Friday closed down a 46-mile stretch of U.S. Route 50, the main route between the state capital of Sacramento and Lake Tahoe on the Nevada state line.
The highway was closed after debris from the blaze fell onto the roadway and because of red flag warnings for 20- to 30-mph winds that by Saturday evening ""combined with continued extremely dry fuels will result in critical fire weather conditions in the vicinity of the Caldor Fire,"" the National Weather Service said.
The winds could gust to 40 mph Saturday.
The road is a key checkpoint as crews struggle against the fire, which erupted earlier this week and grew to 10 times its size in a few days, fueled by winds.
""We're going to invest everything we can into holding the fire south"" of the road, said Eric Schwab, an operations section chief with Cal Fire. 
Firefighters made progress on the fire's western side and burned vegetation to starve it of fuel and prevent the flames from heading into the evacuated community of Pollock Pines. On the northeast side, crews were protecting cabins in the dense forest area, fire officials said.
The Caldor Fire had now devoured about 130 square miles as of Saturday and more than 1,500 firefighters were battling it amid heavy timber and rugged terrain.
The blaze was one of about a dozen large California wildfires that have scorched Northern California, incinerating at least 700 homes alone in and around the Sierra Nevada communities of Greenville and Grizzly Flats. 
Thousands of homes remained under threat in communities tucked away in scenic forests and tens of thousands of people remain under evacuation orders. 
Nine national forests in the region have been closed because of the fire threat.
To the northwest of the Caldor Fire, the massive Dixie Fire kept expanding and new evacuations were ordered, including the tiny hamlet of Taylorsville. In five weeks, the fire about 175 miles northeast of San Francisco has become the second-largest in state history and blackened an area twice the size of Los Angeles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Firefighters battling the blaze as it burns through El Dorado County had been drumming up every available tactic to keep the blaze from crossing the highway, the main artery leading to Lake Tahoe for residents and visitors alike. On Saturday afternoon, the winds pushed flames and burning embers over the highway in the Kyburz area, according to Cal Fire Incident Commander Dusty Martin.
From the fire crews’ base camp in Placerville leading northeast to the Caldor Fire’s footprint, gusts of about 25 mph blew away a protective smoke layer and started pushing flames to the northeast — closing in on the highway and small communities dotted along the roadway and surrounding forestland.
By Saturday night, the blaze was 0% contained, had burned just over 90,000 acres, destroyed 270 structures, and was still threatening more than 13,000, according to Cal Fire.
Cal Fire commanders were working Saturday night to determine how fiercely the fire was burning on the north side of the highway, which includes terrain Cal Fire Capt. Stephen Horner said could present several new challenges, including steep canyons and very dense forested areas, that could make it harder to try and contain the already fast-moving blaze.
“A lot of those questions are being asked currently,” Horner said late Saturday.
Cal Fire spokesman Capt. Keith Wade said Saturday that the Placerville sky was the clearest it had been since midweek, an eerie marker that fearsome winds had arrived. The blaze broke out on Aug. 14.
“That’s not a good sign for what’s happening up the mountain,” Wade said Saturday. “We’re feeling a significant breeze down here, so we know that up the hill it’s very active. The potential for fire impacting those homes today is very real.”
As part of the defensive stand in the area of the highway, firefighters removed dry vegetation, trees and other fuels, while others placed sprinkler lines around houses to slow the flames’ spread. In total, more than 1,500 firefighters and support crews tackled the blaze Saturday, with most lined from Sly Park Road to Kyburz along the fire’s northern front.
Caltrans officials had closed a nearly 50-mile stretch of the highway on Friday out of fears that fire, poor visibility from smoke and falling ash or trees could endanger drivers’ lives.
Caltrans spokeswoman Angela DaPrato said Saturday that those heading to and from Tahoe should take Interstate 80, but steer clear of back roads that could be unexpectedly impacted by the fire. There was no estimate for when Highway 50 may reopen.

Fickle winds and smoke swirling above the flames have made it “very challenging” to predict the weather, said National Weather Service meteorologist Bill Rasch. Although southwesterly winds fanned the flames toward populated communities Tuesday, they switched directions and were largely expected to originate from the east Wednesday, he said.

Since igniting three days ago, the Caldor Fire has rapidly grown into one of the region’s most troubling fires — exploding to 22,919 acres Tuesday, torching buildings in multiple Sierra foothill communities and injuring two people. Strong winds and hot, dry conditions that have accelerated the blaze’s spread are only expected to increase over the next few days, forcing crews to brace for aggressive fire growth and potential runs of more than three miles at a time.
As the wind shifts, smoke from the Caldor Fire and the much larger Dixie Fire to the north is expected to drift into the Bay Area and affect air quality on Wednesday and Thursday, said Brian Garcia, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. The air will be worst in the North Bay, but the impact will be felt across the entire region, Garcia said.
“Everybody’s going to notice it,” he said.
The Bay Area Air Quality Management District issued an advisory for the region due to the smoke, anticipating moderate air quality on Wednesday.
Wildfires already have consumed more than 1.1 million acres in the state so far this year — compared to about 854,000 acres at this point in 2020, according to Cal Fire.

Strong winds blowing in the area near the national park of Sounion were fanning the flames and hampering firefighting efforts. Authorities issued evacuation orders for three settlements in the area.
Greece has been roiled by hundreds of wildfires for about two weeks, with the blazes destroying tens of thousands of hectares of forest and farmland, burning homes and businesses and leading to the evacuation of dozens of villages. One volunteer firefighter has died, and four have been hospitalized, including two in critical condition in intensive care units.
The fires stretched Greeces response capabilities to the limit, leading the government to appeal for international help. About 24 European and Middle Eastern countries sent firefighters, helicopters, planes and vehicles. By Monday most had left, although 40 Austrian firefighters remained in the southern Greek region of the Peloponnese, where two major fires have been burning for several days.
Several Mediterranean countries have suffered intense heat and quickly spreading wildfires in recent weeks, including Turkey, where at least eight people have died, and Italy. In Algeria, wildfires in the mountainous Berber region have killed at least 69 people.
Worsening drought and heat have also fueled wildfires this summer in the Western United States and in Russias northern Siberia region. Scientists say there is little doubt that climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas is driving more extreme weather events.

Greece has been roiled by hundreds of wildfires this month, on the heels of its most severe heat wave in decades, which left its forests tinder dry. Other Mediterranean countries — Turkey, Italy, Algeria and Spain among them — have suffered similar problems.
Scientists say there is little doubt that climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas is driving more extreme weather events.
Monday's first blaze in Greece broke out in the morning in the Keratea region southeast of Athens, burned shrubland and threatened a national park in the Sounion area. Three communities were ordered evacuated. Some residents desperately drenched their homes, while volunteers with hoses and branches helped fight the fires. More than 100 firefighters, eight water-dropping planes and 11 helicopters were striving to contain the blaze, which appeared to be on the wane by evening.
Local mayor Dimitris Loukas told Greek television that authorities were investigating reports of arson. He said residents had seen someone in a car setting a dumpster on fire.
On the other side of the capital, to the northwest, another blaze broke out Monday in the Vilia area, triggering an evacuation alert for eight other villages. Strong winds hampered the firefighting effort, with flames threatening to spread onto a nearby wooded mountain.
That blaze was being fought by 240 firefighters — including 143 from Poland — supported by eight water-dropping planes and nine helicopters.
The fire service said 45 wildfires erupted across the country between late Sunday and late Monday. Most were quickly contained.
Two major fires in Greece that began in early August, one on the island of Evia and another in a national park north of Athens, were still smoldering Monday, and firefighters were trying to secure their perimeters. On Evia, water-bombing planes were deployed again Monday to assist ground forces.
On Monday, Greece's civil protection chief, Nikos Hardalias, who coordinates the fight against wildfires as well as the country's response to the coronavirus pandemic, was taken to an Athens hospital where he underwent unscheduled heart surgery. A health ministry statement said the operation was successful.
Weeks of wildfires have stretched Greece’s response capabilities to the limit. About 24 European and Mideast countries sent ground crews, aircraft and vehicles to help. Most have left, although 40 Austrian firefighters remained in the southern Peloponnese region, where two major fires have been burning for days.

The blaze in the Vilia area broke out Monday shortly after another wildfire started to the southwest of Athens. Several other villages and a nearby nursing home received evacuation orders.
On Wednesday, a shift in the winds drove the flames towards Vilia, 60 kilometers (37 miles) from Athens. Greek media said several outlying buildings were damaged, but no injuries were reported and no evacuation order was issued for the village.
Clouds of smoke obscured the sun, which cast an otherworldly, orange light over the capital.
Local mayor Christos Stathis told Open TV that the fire was within a few dozen yards from Vilia, and appealed for firefighting aircraft to be deployed to the spot.
Hundreds of wildfires have burned across Greece this month, fueled by parched forests and shrubland from the country’s most severe heat wave in decades.
The blazes have stretched the country’s firefighting capabilities to the limit, leading the government to appeal for international help, including through a European Union emergency response system. About two dozen European and Middle Eastern countries responded, sending planes, helicopters, vehicles and hundreds of firefighters.
The causes of the fires have not been officially established, although more than a dozen people have been arrested on suspicion of arson.
State ERT TV reported that a 14-year-old boy was arrested Wednesday in central Greece on suspicion of setting at least 13 fires in recent days — including one that raged out of control destroying homes and forest land. Quoting local officials, ERT said the suspect was caught on CCTV cycling away from spots where fires had started. The boy’s parents were arrested for neglect, ERT said.
Intense heat and wildfires have also struck other Mediterranean countries. Firefighters in France worked to contain a forest fire along the French Riviera on Tuesday, and recent wildfires have killed at least 75 people in Algeria and 16 in Turkey. Worsening drought and heat have also fueled wildfires in the western United States and in Russia’s northern Siberia region.
Greece’s fire department said 430 firefighters, including 143 from Poland, were deployed at the Vilia fire on Wednesday, along with 130 vehicles, 19 helicopters and 10 planes. The army, volunteer firefighters and local authorities also provided assistance.
By midday Wednesday, an estimated 7,500 hectares (18.500 acres) of forest had been destroyed in the area.

Dozens of separate fires have raged through forest areas across northern Algeria since Monday night and Interior Minister Kamel Beldjoud accused arsonists of igniting the flames, without providing more details on the allegations. “Only criminal hands can be behind the simultaneous outbreak of about 50 fires across several localities,” he said.
Last week, a European Union atmosphere monitor said the Mediterranean had become a wildfire hotspot as massive blazes engulfed forests in Turkey and Greece, aided by a heatwave. Residents of the Tizi Ouzou region in Kabylie used tree branches to try to smother burning patches of forest or hurled water from plastic containers in a desperate effort to douse the fire.
The soldiers were killed in different areas, some while trying to extinguish the flames and others after they were cut off by the spreading fire, Kabylie residents said. The Defence Ministry said more soldiers had been badly injured with burns.

Efforts to extinguish the wildfire in Dzukou range continued for the fifth day on Saturday, sources said. OSD of Nagaland State Disaster Management Authority, Johnny Raungmei said that IAF choppers were used to douse the fire on Friday.
On the Nagaland side, it is relatively controlled because of the preventive measure taken by the Kohima District Disaster Management Authority along with personnel from forest, police, fire and emergency services and volunteers from Southern Angami Youth Organisation. The fire has also spread to neighbouring Senapati district of Manipur.
”Based on the requisition by the state government, an IAF Mi-17V5 helicopter equipped with Bambi bucket for firefighting was used in Dzukou valley near Kohima,” said PRO (Defence) Kohima, Lt Col Sumit K Sharma. The IAF choppers conducted recce on Thursday, said Sharma, adding that the mission is still on and it would continue even on Saturday.
About the fire being completely doused, Raungmei said, ”We can’t rule out because as per the pilots there are multiple spots where the fire is burning”. Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) Kohima Rajkumar M said that as per the latest information from the Range Officer, Kohima, a stretch of about 5 km fire line has been cut in the priority area.

Nagaland State Disaster Management Authority's Officer on Special Duty, Johnny Ruangmei said that the heavy gusty winds have affected the officials' effort to tame the fire but we expect that it would be fully brought under control by Monday, as the blaze has been contained partially.
""The IAF helicopters on Saturday sprayed 8 tonnes of water on the wildfire. Over 300 volunteers accompanied by the personnel of various departments and organisations were battling against the raging fire,"" Ruangmei told IANS over phone.
He said that the army, state police, state and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), Forest Department, volunteers of Southern Angami Youth Organisation (SAYO), accompanied by the local people and NGOs, are jointly making fire lines in the Valley to break off the link between the blaze and the forest.
The disaster management officials said that as the fire continued in multiple pockets and hillocks, they are yet to assess the damage and natural destruction of the valley.
IAF spokesperson Wing Commander Ratnakar Singh said that following a requisition by Nagaland, the Eastern Air Command in Shillong had initially deployed a Mi-17V5 helicopter to check the wildfire.

wildfires,,"California firefighters coping with limited resources and worsening weather struggled for a fifth day on Thursday to subdue flames menacing the famed Napa Valley wine region, while major progress was reported against a separate, deadly blaze in the Cascades.
The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said more than 17,000 fire personnel remained on the front lines of two dozen major wildfires across the state, with over 96,000 residents under evacuation orders.
Roughly half of those evacuees have been displaced by a fast-spreading blaze dubbed the Glass Fire, which erupted on Sunday near the Napa Valley resort of Calistoga, some 75 miles (120 km) north of San Francisco, then spread into neighboring Sonoma County.
After a brief respite from fierce gusts that had fanned early growth of the blaze, fire crews on Thursday faced a return of strong winds, combined with above-normal heat and extremely low humidity, prompting red-flag warnings of heightened wildfire risks.
The incendiary weather, supercharging fuel beds overgrown with tinder-dry grass and scrub, is expected to challenge firefighters through the weekend as they battle to defend Napa Valley’s homes and wineries in the midst of its harvest season.
“It’s going to be a big firefight for us in the next 36 hours,” Cal Fire operations section chief Mark Brunton told a late-morning briefing. He added commanders were forced to make due with “a limited amount of resources” due to competing demands for fire personnel throughout the state.
As of Thursday, firefighters have managed to carve firm containment lines around just 5% of the Glass Fire perimeter, which has grown to encompass nearly 57,000 acres (23,000 hectares).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wildfires,,"Smoke from the fires devastating swathes of the US West Coast has reached as far as Europe, the European Union's climate monitoring service said Wednesday in its assessment of the ""unprecedented"" blazes.
Satellite data from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) showed that the wildfires currently raging across California, Oregon and Washington State are ""tens to hundreds of times more intense"" than the recent average.
Thanks to strong pressure systems, the smoke from the fires was trapped along the western part of North America for days, making for potentially dangerous air quality in major cities such as Portland, Oregon and Vancouver and San Francisco.
But the weather shifted on Monday, carrying the smoke east along the jet stream. The site NY Metro Weather said Tuesday that it was visible in the skies above New York.
CAMS said that it had tracked the long-range transport of smoke particles from the fires as far as 8,000 kilometres to the east -- reaching northern Europe.
It estimated that the blazes, which are significantly more likely to occur as the planet warms, have spewed out more than 30 million tonnes of carbon dioxide since mid-August.
""The scale and magnitude of these fires are at a level much higher than any of the 18 years that our monitoring data covers"" since 2003, said Mark Parrington, CMAS senior scientist and wildfire expert.
""The fact that these fires are emitting so much pollution into the atmosphere that we can still see thick smoke over 8000 kilometres away reflects just how devastating they have been in their magnitude and duration.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Triple digit temperatures and single digit humidity fanned flames on Friday evening, and little let-up was expected over the weekend with an excessive heat warning in effect across Southern California.
“We saw extreme fire conditions,” Los Angeles County Fire Department spokesman Frank Garrido said of the operation in steep canyons aided by firefighting helicopters.
The cause of the blaze was under investigation but human activity is likely to blame, said U.S. Forest Service spokesman Andrew Mitchell.
No casualties were reported but the blaze threatened 5,420 homes and other structures in communities about 40 miles (65 km) north of downtown Los Angeles where residents have been told to prepare for possible evacuations over the weekend, Garrido said.

By Friday afternoon, the wind-fueled blaze that risked consuming citrus and avocado orchards as well as other crops was zero percent contained. Authorities said 8,000 people were under evacuation orders and at least two structures had been burned.
Ventura County Sheriff Bill Ayub said fire crews had been thwarted by people flying drones in the area.
""Last night and early morning we had individuals flying small drones in the area of the flight operations for the fire suppression,"" he told a media briefing.
""This creates a very significant hazard for our airborne fire fighting assets and causes them to land and stop firefighting efforts as long as that aircraft is in the area.""
The Maria Fire erupted as crews continue to battle multiple blazes that have broken out across the state in the last two weeks, prompting massive evacuations and power cuts.
Another fire, the Easy Fire, which broke out Wednesday in Ventura County and came dangerously close to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, was almost fully contained on Friday.

The fire was started by a lightning strike on Friday in a forest in New South Wales state, 300 kilometers north of Sydney, and has since burnt 4,900 acres.
Two-thirds of that area was koala habitat, Ashton said. ""If we look at a 50 per cent survival rate, that's around about 350 koalas and that's absolutely devastating,"" Ashton said of the death toll.
""We're hoping it's not as bad as that, but because of the intensity of the fire and the way koalas behave during fire, we're not holding out too much hope,"" she added.
Koalas climb high into trees during wildfires and survive if the fire front passes quickly below them.
The koala colony was particularly heathy and genetically diverse, Ashton said. Koalas prefer coastal forests, which are being cleared for suburban expansion. Increasingly isolated koala colonies have become inbred and diseased.

""This is definitely an event that we're calling historic and extreme,"" David King, meteorologist for the US National Weather Service, told Saturday's Los Angeles Times.
""What's making this event really substantial... is the amount of time that these winds are going to remain."" Hot, intense winds are expected to pick up on Saturday and last into Monday.
The state's largest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric Co., said it expected to cut off power to 850,000 customers -- a precautionary shutdown that local media say would affect about two million people.
""The weather event could be the most powerful in California in decades,"" PG&E said, with dry northeast winds forecast to gust up to 70 miles per hour (112 kilometers per hour).
""PG&E will need to turn off power for safety several hours before the potentially damaging winds arrive,"" it added.
""Winds of this magnitude pose a higher risk of damage and sparks on the electric system and rapid wildfire spread."" About 1,300 firefighters battled the Kincade Fire, which is only five percent contained, according to the California Department of Forestry and Protection.
""I can't explain it,"" 70-year-old Tina Tavares, who was evacuated from her Geyserville home, told the San Francisco Chronicle.
""It's like you're in a bad earthquake, the ground is opening up... and you're seeing it and don't know what to do."" PG&E has come under fierce scrutiny after it reported that even though power had already been shut down to nearly 28,000 customers in Sonoma County this week, some high-voltage transmission lines were still operating when the fire broke out.
The same type of lines was responsible for California's deadliest wildfire ever -- last year's Camp Fire, which killed 86 people.
PG&E, which filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this year, has been blamed for several other fires in the state in recent years.
Governor Newsom hit out at the company on Friday, saying it had put ""profits over the people of California for too long."" He said it was ""infuriating beyond words"" that a state such as California had to endure blackouts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wildfires,,"Wind-driven wildfires forced the evacuation of about 100,000 people in southern California Friday and destroyed dozens of structures and homes as authorities warned it could take days to extinguish the flames.
By Friday evening, the strongest blaze, dubbed the Saddleridge Fire, had consumed 7,542 acres (3,052 hectares) in areas of the San Fernando Valley, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of downtown Los Angeles, fire officials said.
They added that it had damaged or destroyed at least 31 structures and was 13 percent contained as of Friday evening.
One man in his 50s died of a heart attack as he struggled to save his home in the Porter Ranch area, fire officials said.
The fire quickly got out of control after it erupted late Thursday for unknown reasons in the city of Sylmar, driven by low humidity and gusts known as the Santa Ana winds.
""This is a very dynamic fire,"" Los Angeles Fire Department Chief Ralph Terrazas told a news conference.
""Do not wait to leave,"" he urged residents. ""If we ask you to evacuate, please evacuate.""
He said some 1,000 firefighters, backed by water-dropping helicopters and planes releasing fire retardants, were battling the blaze that forced the shutdown of several major highways. The metro line in the area was also closed as were schools and businesses.
""We've calculated that the fire is moving at a rate of 800 acres per hour,"" Terrazas said, adding that it would probably take days to get it under control.
Some 200 firefighters were meanwhile battling several other blazes in Riverside County, east of Los Angeles, including one that tore through a trailer park and was started by burning trash.
That blaze, dubbed the Sandalwood fire, destroyed 76 homes and buildings and killed an 89-year-old woman who was unable to escape the flames.
There were no immediate reports of injuries, but authorities ordered several hundred homes in the area be evacuated.
The National Weather Service said it expects the high winds fanning the flames to subside by Friday evening, making it easier for firefighters to do their work.
A red flag warning — which indicates ripe conditions for wildfires — remains in effect through Saturday.
""That seems to be the new normal in California,"" lamented Sylmar resident Oscar Mancillas, as he helplessly watched the flames spread in the hillside near his home.
""I mean the vegetation is so dry... but we're kind of lucky because it didn't grow back from the last fire,"" he told AFP. ""In California
you have to be earthquake ready and you have to be fire ready... and for those of us who have a family, it's a little daunting sometimes.""
The wildfires in the south erupted as California's largest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), implemented rolling power blackouts that affected some two million people in northern California this week.
About 312,000 customers remained in the dark Friday as a result of the shutoffs designed to reduce the threat of wildfire that can be sparked by lines downed in heavy winds.
Many schools and universities were also closed in northern parts of the state as people stocked up on gasoline, water, batteries and other basics, with frustration mounting at the blackouts condemned by some as ""third world.
""We're seeing a scale and scope of something that no state in the 21st century should experience,"" Governor Gavin Newsom said Thursday, blaming decades of what he called neglect and mismanagement by PG&E.
""This is not, from my perspective, a climate change story as much as a story about greed and mismanagement over the course of decades,"" Newsom said. ""Neglect, a desire to advance not public safety but profits.""
PG&E has defended the outages as necessary for safety reasons and has said it will take days before power is restored to all customers as inspections must be conducted on all power lines and equipment before the lights can be turned back on.
""This is not how we want to serve you but blackouts can happen again,"" Bill Johnson, the CEO of the company said Thursday.
Last November, PG&E's faulty power lines were determined to have sparked the deadliest wildfire in the state's modern history, which killed 86 and destroyed the town of Paradise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wildfires,,"A fast-moving wildfire that broke out on Thursday on the outskirts of a National Forest in Northern California has prompted the evacuation of a community college, a major highway and some residents, officials said.
The Mountain Fire, which erupted about noon PDT just north of the town of Bella Vista in Shasta County, had raced across some 600 acres (240 hectares) within a few hours, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said on its incident website.
Photos of the blaze posted on Twitter by the Shasta County Sheriff's Office showed thick black and grey smoke billowing into the area over a highway near the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. There was no containment of the flames.
""Jones Valley and Bella Vista area residents! This situation is very fluid and rapidly changing, if you do not see your road listed but feel you are in danger YOU MAY EVACUATE to Shasta College Gymnasium,"" the sheriff's department said in a separate tweet.
The Shasta College campus was closed along with Highway 299 and about a dozen smaller roads. Residents of small communities in the path of the flames were told to evacuate or be prepared to flee on short notice.
California was hit by some of the deadliest and most destructive wildfires in a century last year and state officials have warned this year's fire season could be similarly intense.
The Camp Fire, which broke out in Butte County in November and overran the town of Paradise, killed 89 people and left thousands of others homeless. State fire investigators determined that the Camp Fire was sparked by Pacific Gas & Electric Co transmission lines.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wildfires,,"The lights were back on Friday for many of the nearly 2 million Northern California residents who lost electricity when the state's largest utility switched it off this week in an effort to prevent wildfires, as the first death linked to the outages was reported a man who relied on oxygen.
The threat of widespread outages loomed in Southern California after the winds moved to the Los Angeles area, where a wildfire fueled by strong Santa Ana winds prompted officials to order the evacuation of 100,000 people from their homes in the foothills of the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles County.
In that fire, one man went into cardiac arrest and died at the scene.
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. restored power in Northern California after workers inspected power lines to make sure it was safe to do so. The winds had increased the possibility of transmission lines toppling to the ground and starting wildfires.
The utility said 543,000 Northern California businesses and residences got their power back but that nearly 195,000 customers were still in the dark. More than half of those who lost power in the San Francisco Bay Area had it again on Friday.
The city itself was not subject to the preventive outages. Experts have said there are between two and three people for every electrical customer.
El Dorado County officials on Friday said a man dependent on oxygen died about 12 minutes after PG&E cut off power this week. Marie Aldea of Pollock Pines said her 67-year-old father Robert Mardis Sr. was asleep when the electricity went out around 3.30 am Wednesday and likely couldn't wake up in time to get his back up machine, which ran on battery.
""We were all asleep, we heard my mom scream. She was crying,"" she told KTXL-TV in Sacramento .
""My dad went down in her arms, he was going for this oxygen machine."" Aldea said her father's health was poor, but she doesn't understand why the utility turned off the power.
""No winds at all. And because of that, my father is gone,"" she said.
PG&E spokesman Jeff Smith said the utility has not been able to confirm the report.
""It's devastating beyond words,"" said Gov. Gavin Newsom. ""Losing a family member is horrific and to the extent this was the reason why I hope that is investigated and I hope those responsible are held to account."" The death was first reported by the Mountain Democrat in Placerville.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wildfires,,"Wildfires raging in the Amazon rainforest have hit a record number this year, with 72,843 fires detected so far by Brazil's space research center INPE, as concerns grow over right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro's environmental policy.
The surge marks an 83% increase over the same period of 2018, the agency said on Tuesday, and is the highest since records began in 2013. Since Thursday, INPE said satellite images spotted 9,507 new forest fires in the country, mostly in the Amazon basin, home to the world's largest tropical forest seen as vital to countering global warming.
Images show the northernmost state of Roraima covered in dark smoke. Amazonas declared an emergency in the south of the state and in its capital Manaus on Aug. 9. Acre, on the border with Peru, has been on environmental alert since Friday due to the fires.
Wildfires have increased in Mato Grosso and Para, two states where Brazil's agricultural frontier has pushed into the Amazon basin and spurred deforestation. Wildfires are common in the dry season, but are also deliberately set by farmers illegally deforesting land for cattle ranching.
The unprecedented surge in wildfires has occurred since Bolsonaro took office in January vowing to develop the Amazon region for farming and mining, ignoring international concern over increased deforestation.
Asked about the spread of uncontrolled fires, Bolsonaro brushed off criticism, saying it was the time of the year of the ""queimada"" or burn, when farmers use fire to clear land. ""I used to be called Captain Chainsaw. Now I am Nero, setting the Amazon aflame. But it is the season of the queimada,"" he told reporters.
Space agency INPE, however, said the large number of wildfires could not be attributed to the dry season or natural phenomena alone.
""There is nothing abnormal about the climate this year or the rainfall in the Amazon region, which is just a little below average,"" said INPE researcher Alberto Setzer.
People frequently blame the dry season for the wildfires in the Amazon, but that is not quite accurate, he said.
""The dry season creates the favorable conditions for the use and spread of fire, but starting a fire is the work of humans, either deliberately or by accident,"" Setzer said.
Bolsonaro recently fired the director of INPE after he criticized agency statistics showing an increase in deforestation in Brazil, saying they were inaccurate. ""I am waiting for the next set of numbers, that will not be made up numbers. If they are alarming, I will take notice of them in front of you,"" he told reporters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wildfires,," A fire raged out of control on the Spanish holiday island of Gran Canaria, forcing evacuations as flames rose so high even water-dropping planes could not operate in what was dubbed an ""environmental tragedy"".
The blaze, the third in 10 days in the mountainous centre of the island, has forced the evacuation of several villages with a combined population of 9,000, a spokeswoman for the emergency services said.
The exact number of evacuees was unclear on the island that lies at the heart of the Canary archipelago off the coast of northwest Africa.
No fatalities have been reported and tourism on Gran Canaria, which boasts breathtaking views and is popular with foreigners, had not been affected.
""It's a huge forest fire, extremely serious, which happened in a heatwave,"" and it is still not under control, Canary Islands President Angel Victor Torres told reporters late Monday.
""This is an environmental tragedy.""
Altogether, 1,000 firefighters and other crew and 14 water-dropping helicopters and planes were working on controlling the blaze, which is estimated to have destroyed 10,000 hectares (24,700 acres), according to emergency services.
This deployment ""is the biggest ever carried out in the Canaries and one of the biggest implemented in Spain in the past few years,"" said Agriculture Minister Luis Planas.
Firefighters said the blaze was propelled by high temperatures, strong winds and low humidity.
So fierce is the fire in what is part of a UNESCO biosphere reserve that in some areas, it ""is beyond our extinction capacities,"" Federico Grillo, head of emergency services in Gran Canaria, said late Sunday.
On the northwestern flank of the blaze, flames have risen as high as 50 metres (160 feet), preventing ground crew or water-dropping aircraft from approaching, the emergency services spokeswoman said.
She added around 100 people had been ""confined"" to the cultural centre of Artenara, unable to leave this village in the disaster zone as all possible evacuation roads were too dangerous.
Environment Minister Planas said the next 48 hours would be ""critical"".
The fire broke out on Saturday afternoon, just days after another wildfire in the same region forced the evacuation of hundreds.
Lourdes Hernandez, an expert on wildfires at WWF, told AFP the blaze had entered the Tamadaba natural park, an untouched pine forest that represents ""the main green lungs of the island"".
The fire is also threatening the Inagua nature reserve, another area of major biodiversity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wildfires,,"Hawaii's governor on Friday declared an emergency on the island of Maui, where firefighters were battling a blaze that has forced the evacuations of thousands of people and sent huge clouds of smoke billowing over nearby beaches.
The fire on Maui, sometimes called the Valley Isle, has scorched more than 10,000 acres (4,000 hectares) of former sugar cane fields and brush since erupting on Thursday, and by Friday was 20 percent contained, island officials said in a statement.
The blaze began in the island's central valley, and steady winds of up to 20 miles per hour (30 kmh) stoked the flames, officials said. The fire prompted thousands of residents and visitors in the communities of Maalaea and Kihei to flee as a precaution.
""I am declaring our Valley Isle a disaster area for the purpose of implementing the emergency management functions as allowed by law,"" Hawaii Governor David Ige said in a statement.
The Honolulu Star-Advertiser said there were no reports of injuries or damage to buildings. The cause of the fire was under investigation.

wildfires,," Alaska's heat wave is driving wildfires and melting glaciers, choking the state’s biggest cities with smoke and bloating rivers with meltwater.
In Anchorage, home to about 40 percent of Alaskans, the National Weather Service issued a dense smoke advisory on Sunday warning against prolonged outdoor activity, along with advisories for the elderly and the sick to stay indoors.
The culprit is the Swan Lake wildfire to the south in the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, which has burned since a June 5 lightning strike and consumed more than 68,000 acres, fire managers said.
To the north, in Fairbanks, fire officials ordered evacuations in two areas and told residents in a third to be prepared to leave because of the Shovel Creek Fire, which had grown to 5,568 acres by Sunday.
""People should GO, evacuate NOW. Leave immediately. DO NOT delay leaving,"" the evacuation order said. In all, there were 354 wildfires covering 443,211 acres in Alaska as of Sunday morning, according to state and federal fire managers.
Along with the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, which had multiple active fires, iconic spots with fires burning include Denali National Park and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Record warmth and near-record warmth in most of the state has created flammable conditions from the Canadian border in the east to the Bering Sea coast in the west.
Anchorage was one of the areas that saw record-breaking heat in June, which followed a record-warm spring for Alaska as a whole, said Rick Thoman, a Fairbanks-based climate scientist with the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy.
""This very warm weather, on top of the warm May, the very early snowmelt, then we had those two weeks of lightning strikes, it’s the classic setup,"" Thoman said.
Melting glaciers and mountain snowfields are bloating rivers and streams across a large swath of south central Alaska, the NWS said. The melt has brought water levels to flood stage at the Yentna River northwest of Anchorage on Sunday, said NWS forecaster Bob Clay.​",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wildfires,,"Wildfires burned out of control on Friday across California, killing at least nine people in a mountain town and forcing residents to flee the upscale beach community of Malibu in the face of a monster fire storm.
All nine victims were found in and around the Northern California town of Paradise, where more than 6,700 homes and businesses were burned down by the Camp Fire, making it one of the most destructive in state history, according to California Department of Forestry and Fire protection data.
""This event was the worst-case scenario. It was the event we have feared for a long time,"" Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said at a Friday evening press conference. ""Regrettably, not everybody made it out.""
The remains of five of the victims were discovered in or near burned out cars, three outside residences and one inside a home, Honea said.
Another 35 people had been reported missing and three firefighters had been injured.
The flames descended on Paradise so quickly that many people were forced to abandon their cars and run for their lives down the sole road through the mountain town.
A school bus was among several abandoned vehicles left blackened by flames on one road.
The Camp Fire, which broke out on Thursday at the edge of the Plumas National Forest northeast of Sacramento, has since blackened more than 90,000 acres and was only 5 percent contained as of nightfall on Friday.
A total of 6,453 homes had been destroyed in Paradise and elsewhere, Honea said, along with 260 commercial buildings. The Tubbs Fire, which destroyed 5,636 structures in Napa and Sonoma counties in October 2017, is listed by Cal Fire as the most destructive in state history.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Firefighters are battling raging fires at both ends of the state, but there is little hope of containing the flames anytime soon.
""Today, 14 additional bodies were located, which brings our total number to 23,"" Sheriff Kory Honea told a news conference.
Ten of the bodies were found in the town of Paradise while four were discovered in the Concow area, both in Butte County, Honea said.
Rescuers could be seen removing remains over a period of several hours in Paradise and placing them in a black hearse. Pieces of bodies were transported by bucket, while intact remains were carried in body bags.
So far, a total of 19 of the people killed in what authorities have dubbed the ""Camp Fire"" have been reported in Paradise, where more than 6,700 buildings -- most of them residences -- have been consumed by the late-season inferno.
From miles around, acrid smoke could be seen in the sky around Paradise, the sun barely visible. On the ground, cars were reduced to metal carcasses, while power lines were also gnawed by the flames.
Locals fled the danger, but police told AFP some farmers returned to check on their cattle.
""The magnitude of destruction we have seen is really unbelievable and heartbreaking, and our hearts go to everybody who has been affected by this,"" said Mark Ghilarducci, the director of the California Office of Emergency Services.
Governor-elect Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency to provide assistance to the hardest-hit areas in the fire-prone state.

Fanned by strong winds, it has so far scorched 100,000 acres (40,500 hectares) and is 20 percent contained, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said Saturday. So far, three of the more than 3,200 firefighters deployed have been injured.
They estimate they will need three weeks to fully contain the blaze.
Local power authorities have told state officials an outage occurred near the spot where the fire erupted, The Sacramento Bee reported, but there is still no official cause of the Camp Fire blaze.

wildfires,,"Firefighters in California gained ground on Monday against a massive wildfire burning part of Yosemite National Park, although complete containment may be weeks away, officials said.
Crews working through the night got an edge on the so-called Rim Fire, a 350-square mile (906-square km) blaze that has charred the California park's Northwest, said Andrea Capps, spokeswoman for the Rim Fire command center.
They connected containment lines near the fire's northwestern and western borders, where most of the 4,500 homes threatened by the blaze are located, she said.
The fire was 60 percent contained by early Monday, a 15 percent increase from the night before.
""On Monday night is when it all really tied together,"" Capps said. ""It's looking really good over there right now. They're calling that containment line secure.""
Despite the jump in containment, Capps said fire analysts estimate that it could take until September 20 to contain the Rim Fire fully. Steep terrain and high, unpredictable winds will likely pose the main challenges in digging and burning containment lines around the blaze.
""The majority of the containment lines will probably be really strong by the middle, end of this week, but they just want to give themselves enough time to make sure it's fully contained,"" Capps said.
Wet weather expected in the area on Monday raised hopes, but the possibility of thunderstorms kept officials wary.
""Rain is good, but the winds that come with the pressure changes with the thunderstorms could lead to some unpredictable (fire) behaviour,"" Capps said. ""We have had a few sprinkles on Tuesday morning, and so we're all waiting to see what happens.""
While the majority of the fire was burning on Stanislaus National Forest, 60,214 acres, or about 27 percent, of the fire has crossed the Yosemite National Park border.
The massive blaze has scorched an area larger than many US cities and is the fourth-largest on record in California, burning more than 220,000 acres over the past two weeks.

wildfires,2016-2017,"On a dry October day this year, a stray lightning strike ignited a fire in Georgia’s Chattahoochee National Forest. The resulting wildfire, eventually stretching 11,000 hectares and burning for 6 weeks, marked an early start to the record-breaking fall fire season that the southeastern United States experienced this year. More than 50 major wildfires crawled through eight states, burned more than 40,000 hectares, and led to 14 deaths. The fires, which were more aggressive and more difficult to contain than usual, even produced smoke visible from space.
Now, with Appalachia’s wildfires fizzling out, fire scientists and fire managers are figuring out what they can learn from the conflagrations. In part, they hope to assemble data that might help them identify areas most at risk of dangerous fires, and encourage management practices—such as the use of prescribed burns—which could limit future outbreaks.
“We want to know how to move forward scientifically,” says Helen Mohr, a forester with the United States Forest Service (USFS) Southern Research Station who directs the Consortium of Appalachian Fire Managers and Scientists (CAFMS), based at Clemson University in South Carolina. “We want to inform scientists, managers, and communities how to keep their homes and forests safe.”
This fall’s wildfires were “really a perfect storm, so to speak,” says Donald Hagan, a forest ecologist at Clemson University. The blazes burned so quickly and out-of-control that counties in Kentucky, North Carolina, and Tennessee declared states of emergency and hundreds were hospitalized. One significant factor contributing to the fires’ speed and destruction is an extreme drought in the region, affecting states including Georgia, Tennessee, and North Carolina. That meant no rain to tamp down flames, and plenty of dry brush and wood that acted as fuel. In some areas, more than a century of fire suppression has allowed dead trees and other fuel to build up to dangerous levels, Hagan says. A lack of fire also allowed oily shrubs that burn easily, such as mountain laurel and rhododendron, to take over large swaths of forest. So when fires started, they tended to burn longer and spread more quickly, he says.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wildfires,,"The summer of 2015 was unlike anything most career firefighters had ever seen. Across the United States, fires erupted not only in dry woodlands, but also in grasslands, rainforests, and tundra, ignited by lightning strikes and careless campers. Flames dripped from lichen-covered trees in the Pacific Northwest, and in Alaska, ate into permafrost. Two hundred. U.S. military personnel were called in to battle the ferocious blazes across the West — as were Canadians, Australians, and New Zealanders.
By year’s end, wildfires would consume more than 10.1 million acres of land in the U.S., destroying 4,500 homes and taking the lives of 13 wildland firefighters. Fighting the blazes cost an unprecedented $2.6 billion, the majority spent in the West. ""While the news that more than 10 million acres burned is terrible, it's not shocking, and it is probable that records will continue to be broken,” said Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack in a press release last week. 
The burned acreage surpasses the 2006 record of 9.9 million acres, which itself was the biggest year documented since modern record keeping began in 1960 (during the 1920s through 1940s, burned acreage averaged 30 million to 50 million acres). Though more than 68,000 fires flared this summer, it was ultimately Alaska that put 2015 into the record books. More than 5.1 million acres burned up north, the state’s second largest fire season after 2004.
“This year we had fires occurring from the Canadian border over by Northway, on the Alaskan Highway, all the way out to the Lower Kuskokwim River, almost to Bethel, which drops into the Bering Sea, all at the same time,” says Kent Slaughter, manager of the Alaska Fire Service, noting though this season wasn’t the largest, fires were more widespread. 
Because Alaska’s fire season typically has a head start on the Lower 48, the state’s fire managers are able to call on the rest of the nation for crews and tankers. Still, resources are finite, says Ken Frederick, spokesman for the National Interagency Fire Center.
“There’s only 30 to 40 large air tankers in the system, 110 hotshot crews, and around 400 smokejumpers — when everything is busy, very quickly all resources are committed … and not everything can be supplied,” he says.
Due to the state’s remote, rugged terrain, firefighting in Alaska can be especially expensive. “They require a lot of aircraft and they have less infrastructure to get to fires,” Frederick explains.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

wildfires,,"A multi-headed monster. An animal of fire. The Beast.
As it raged out of control across northern Alberta and burst into Fort McMurray with unparalleled ferocity, the wildfire began racking up a list of colourful nicknames.
Within the span of a few days, the blaze had swelled in size, from some 1,200 hectares (3,000 acres) to more than 220,000 hectares (544,000 acres) . It cut a path of destruction through Fort McMurray, a city in the heart of Alberta’s oilsands, forcing the evacuation of more than 88,000 people and flattening some parts of the city, leaving a trail of charred rubble in its wake.
Few on the front lines had ever seen anything like it. “It’s an unprecedented fire with respect to the rate it spread, how it involved the community,” said regional fire chief Darby Allen earlier this week, after cooler temperatures and higher humidity allowed crews to get a handle on the fire.
“The way this thing happened, the way it travelled, the way it behaved – they’re rewriting their formulas on how fires behave, based on this fire,” he said.
So what made this fire different from the hundreds of others that ignite yearly in the region, or other wildfires around the world? “We’ve had faster fire speeds, we’ve had bigger fires, but this one, in terms of impact and where it landed, it is definitely historic,” explained Chad Morrison, Alberta’s manager of wildfire prevention.
A 2011 fire in northern Alberta grew to more than 700,000 hectares (1.7m acres). Another, in 1951, burned some 1.4m hectares (3.5m acres), becoming one of the largest recorded fires ever seen in North America. But these fires burned in remote areas of the province, Morrison said. “I don’t think we’ve ever seen a community of this size and scale be impacted by a wildfire of this size and ferocity.”
The fire pitted firefighting crews – often more used to battling blazing houses or apartments – against a wildfire capable of sweeping through entire neighbourhoods. Firefighters managed to save around 85% of the city, leaving an estimated 2,400 homes and buildings to the flames.
The cause of the extreme fire, which first ignited in a remote forested area, remains under investigation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

drought,,"California is at the edge of another protracted drought, just a few years after one of the worst dry spells in state history left poor and rural communities without well water, triggered major water restrictions in cities, forced farmers to idle their fields, killed millions of trees, and fueled devastating megafires.
On Thursday, the unofficial end of California’s wet season, officials announced that the accumulation of snow in the Sierra Nevada mountains and the Cascades was about 40% below average levels. The state doesn’t have enough snow and rain banked to replenish its groundwater supplies, feed its rivers and streams or fill depleted reservoirs.
“It’s not just that we’re anticipating a dry year, it’s that this is our second extremely dry year, in a row,” said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California Los Angeles and the Nature Conservancy. California _ along with much of the US west _ is parched, Swain added, and should brace for water cuts and arid conditions that could trigger more destructive wildfires.

Poor rainfall has led to the country’s most severe drought in a decade and left the megacity of 17 million people with critically low levels of water, according to Turkey’s chamber of chemical engineers. The Ankara mayor, Mansur Yava?, said earlier this month the capital had another 110 days’ worth in dams and reservoirs.
?zmir and Bursa, Turkey’s next two biggest cities, are also struggling, with dams that are about 36% and 24% full respectively, and farmers in wheat-producing areas such as the Konya plain and Edirne province on the border with Greece and Bulgaria are warning of crop failure.
The acute lack of rainfall in the second half of 2020 _ approaching 50% year on year for November _ led the religious affairs directorate to instruct imams and their congregations to pray for rain last month.
Turkey is a “water stressed” country, with just 1,346 cubic metres of water per capita per year, and has faced several droughts since the 1980s due to a combination of population growth, industrialisation, urban sprawl and climate change.
“Instead of focusing on measures to keep water demand under control, Turkey insists on expanding its water supply through building more dams  Turkey has built hundreds of dams in the last two decades,” said Dr Akgün ?lhan, a water management expert at the Istanbul Policy Center.

drought,,"A megadrought worse than any in “known prehistory” may already be underway in the western United States and northern Mexico, researchers have suggested.
After experiencing a wetter-than-average 20th century, the region has been suffering an ever-lengthening string of dry years starting in 2000, and scientists have now warned the worsening climate crisis is partly responsible for pushing the region towards extreme long-term drought.
The study is based on modern weather observations, along with 1,200 years of tree-ring data and dozens of climate models.
“Earlier studies were largely model projections of the future,” said lead author Park Williams, a bioclimatologist at Columbia University‘s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.
“We’re no longer looking at projections, but at where we are now. We now have enough observations of current drought and tree-ring records of past drought to say that we’re on the same trajectory as the worst prehistoric droughts.”
Reliable modern observations date only to about 1900, but tree rings have allowed scientists to infer yearly soil moisture for centuries before humans began influencing the climate.
The study has rung alarm bells, as previous research has linked the catastrophic ancient droughts recorded in tree rings to concurrent upheavals among indigenous medieval-era civilisations in the southwest US.
The new study is the most up-to-date and comprehensive long-term analysis, the researchers have said. It covers an area stretching across nine US states from Oregon and Montana down through California and New Mexico, and part of northern Mexico.
Using rings from thousands of trees, the researchers charted dozens of droughts across the region, starting in 800 AD.
Four stand out as so-called megadroughts, with extreme aridity lasting decades: the late 800s, mid-1100s, the 1200s, and the late 1500s. After 1600, there were other droughts, but none on such a large scale.
The team then compared the ancient megadroughts to soil moisture records calculated from observed weather in the years from 2000 to 2018.
They found the current drought is already outdoing the three earliest ones. The fourth, which spanned 1575 to 1603, may have been the worst of all — but the difference is slight enough to be within the range of uncertainty.
Furthermore, the current drought is affecting wider areas more consistently than any of the earlier ones — this is the “fingerprint” of climate change and associated temperatures, the researchers said.
All of the ancient droughts lasted longer than 19 years — the one that started in the 1200s ran for nearly a century — but all began by following a similar path to what is happening now, they said.
The ancient droughts weren’t driven by manmade climate change, and nature is still playing a strong role today.
A study last year led by Nathan Steiger at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University showed among other things, that unusually cool periodic conditions over the tropical Pacific Ocean (commonly called La Ni?a) during the previous megadroughts pushed storm tracks further north, and starved the region of precipitation.",https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/megadrought-us-mexico-climate-change-global-warming-study-a9470516.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"A severe drought is threatening South Africa's wildlife industry, with game farmers keeping fewer animals and tourists visiting game lodges in smaller numbers.
Parts of the country have been affected by consecutive years of abnormally hot weather and below average rainfall that have scorched grazing lands and dried up watering holes since 2015, the driest year on record.
Industry body Wildlife Ranching South Africa (WRSA) estimates the Northern Cape province has lost more than two-thirds of its game over the last three years.
It is conducting a countrywide survey to determine the scale of animal losses and the financial impact on the country's more than 9,000 wildlife ranches.
“It's been an extraordinary drought,” said WRSA chief Adri Kitshoff-Botha. “It's not a one-year or two-year drought. In some areas we've seen it has been going now for six years.”
The wildlife industry generates revenue for South Africa through tourism, hunting, breeding and meat production.
Trophy hunting alone generated 2bn rand (£106m) in 2016, according to research carried out for the environment ministry.
Southern Africa's temperatures are rising at twice the global average rate, according to the International Panel on Climate Change, and in much of South Africa the level of water in reservoirs is dwindling.
For Burger Schoeman, manager at Northern Cape game farm Thuru Lodge, the withered vegetation and parched ground are a serious concern for the sector.
Once home to around 4,500 wild animals _ including 35 different species, from antelope to rhino _ the lodge has lost around 1,000 animals due to drought. Carcasses are piling up in abandoned mines on the edge of the property.

Since October, the giant creatures have been found in Hwange National Park, although other parks have also been affected by the drought.?
Other species including giraffes, buffalos and impalas are also dying and the situation will only improve once rain returns, said Tinashe Farawo, a spokesperson for Zimbabwe National Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (Zimparks).
“Almost every animal is being affected,” he said. “Of course, elephants are easily noticed during patrols or game drives, but some bird species are seriously affected because they can only breed in certain tree heights and those trees are being knocked down by elephants.”
Many animals are straying from Zimbabwe’s parks into nearby communities in search of food and water.
Zimparks said 33 people have died from conflict with animals this year.
The drought has also taken its toll on crops, leaving more than half of the population in need of food aid.
The agency said it plans to move 600 elephants, two prides of lions and other animals from the Save Valley Conservancy in the south east of the country to less congested parks.

The rivers of Iraq, above all the Tigris and Euphrates, are drying up. The country is becoming more arid, and desertification is eating into the limited amount of agricultural land.
Dams built upriver in Turkey, Syria and Iran since the 1970s have reduced the flow of water that reaches Iraq by as much as half and the situation is about to get worse.
“On 1 July, Turkey will start filling the Ilisu dam on the Tigris and this will cause another decline in the inflows to our country of about 50 per cent,” Hassan Janabi, minister of water resources, told The Independent.
He says that Iraq used to get 30 billion cubic metres of water a year from the Euphrates, but now “we are happy if we get 16 billion cubic metres”.

When the rains fail, glaciers in the high-mountain regions around the Himalayas are a life-saver, releasing 36 cubic kilometres of water _ the equivalent of 14 million Olympic swimming pools _ to drought-prone areas every summer.
Glacial loss in the region has been going on for a few decades. However, the rate has increased _ between 2000 and 2016, glaciers were shrinking 1.6 times faster than the period between 1951 to 2007.
“A lot of the climate projections suggest the melt will continue to accelerate,” lead researcher Dr Hamish Pritchard, a glaciologist from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), told The Independent.
Using climate projections, Dr Pritchard believes the glacier melt will start to slow in around 2050.
He added: “As we start to get drought stress hitting, there will be crop failures and a loss of livestock. It could cause people to migrate and if you can’t migrate, it might cause conflict as people will need to fight with their neighbours for food.”
This will hit areas such as the fertile Indus Valley, which has been inhabited by human civilisations for many thousands of years and today feeds 237 million people.

This year, drought was already underway in April, in a big part of Central Europe, ranging from moderate to extreme, according to data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) and in many regions the drought has continued throughout June, making 2020 the third year in a row with unexpectedly dry conditions, according to the Copernicus Emergency Management service.
In the future, this might not be such an uncommon event. Halfway through this century, droughts are predicted to become more frequent, threatening a wide range of sectors, from water and energy supply to river transport and agriculture. “The Mediterranean sub-region, already suffering most from water scarcity, is projected to experience the strongest negative effects of climate change on drought conditions,” the Joint Research Center (JRC) Droughts Team told Euronews. “With increasing global warming, streamflow deficits in this region are expected to happen more frequently, become more severe and last longer,” the JRC team said. If global temperatures rise by 3 degrees, the researchers say an additional 11 million people and 4.5 million hectares could be annually exposed to droughts that used to occur only once every 10 years or so. “We see a strong divide within Europe, with more drought in the South and less in the North,” says Dr. Niko Wanders, hydrological extremes researcher at Utrecht University. “We’re observing that extreme droughts are likely to become more severe. This is caused by a combination of higher temperatures and more evaporation that results in bigger water losses,” says Dr. Wanders.
A noticeable factor comes from the fact that rivers are also receiving less water from glaciers, according to experts at the University of Birmingham. Warming in the European Alps in the last three decades, combined with less snowfall has resulted in a little bit under a 54% loss in glacier ice area since 1850; long-term predictions show further drastic reductions.
Rivers affected by drought lose more than water depth. Less rainwater means that river waters cannot dilute pollutants efficiently; this leads to higher concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as of heavy metals and microplastics, according to experts from the MaRIUS research consortium. The organic build up boosts algal production, leading to blooms that could make the water unusable for human use. Hotter river waters also hold less oxygen than cold ones, which harms fish and other aquatic fauna.",https://www.euronews.com/2020/08/03/flowing-low-how-can-europe-use-climate-information-to-manage-dry-river-spells,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"Rivers ravaged by a lengthy drought may not be able to recover, even after the rains return. Seven years after the Millennium drought baked southeastern Australia, a large fraction of the region’s rivers still show no signs of returning to their predrought water flow, researchers report in the May 14 Science.
There’s “an implicit assumption that no matter how big a disturbance is, the water will always come back — it’s just a matter of how long it takes,” says Tim Peterson, a hydrologist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. “I’ve never been satisfied with that.”
The years-long drought in southeastern Australia, which began sometime between 1997 and 2001 and lasted until 2010, offered a natural experiment to test this assumption, he says. “It wasn’t the most severe drought” the region has ever experienced, but it was the longest period of low rainfall in the region since about 1900.
Peterson and colleagues analyzed annual and seasonal streamflow rates in 161 river basins in the region from before, during and after the drought. By 2017, they found, 37 percent of those river basins still weren’t seeing the amount of water flow that they had predrought. Furthermore, of those low-flow rivers, the vast majority — 80 percent — also show no signs that they might recover in the future, the team found.",https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-river-drought-australia-recovery-water-flow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"Manitoba farmer Chuck Fossay has never seen his fields this dry.
As he scoops up a handful of black top soil, it runs through his fingers like sand. 
""It's just bone dry. And there's nothing there to support the seed and the crop to grow,"" he said.
Farming near Starbuck, Man., about 20 minutes west of Winnipeg, Fossay is trying to get his canola into the ground. 
He's planting a little deeper this year, hoping to find moisture so the seeds can germinate and start growing.
He hopes that with some well-timed rain, he can still salvage a near-average crop but with conditions this dry, he said it's likely compromised before it's even planted.
""Dry is dry and nothing grows without water. That's just a fact of life. You need water to live. And if you don't have enough water, nothing grows,"" Fossay said.
""If we don't get a rain, a nice, general soaking rain probably the next two weeks, we're probably talking a crop failure out here in Manitoba.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"Over the past two years, drought has severely affected much of Brazil. According to a bulletin from the National Center for Monitoring and Alerts on Natural Disasters (Cemaden), an agency of the Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovations and Communications, rainfall has been below historical averages in the center-west, south and part of the southeast regions of the country, including in the state of S?o Paulo.
The phenomenon became more evident in 2012. “Severe drought started in the northeast and lasted almost seven years,” says Cemaden researcher Adriana Cuartas. “Then, in 2014, water supply was in critical conditions in the Greater S?o Paulo area. Now the focus of concerns turns to the south, where rainfall has been below average for almost two years.”
Scientist Ant?nio Donato Nobre, author of the report “The Future Climate of Amazonia,” is emphatic: “South America is drying up as a result of the combined effects of deforestation and climate change.”
Low precipitation has an immediate impact on agriculture. The next affected are water supply and power generation. Water levels in the reservoirs of several dams have been low, including Itaipu, the world’s second-largest hydroelectric power plant. “The water that comes from the rivers to the reservoir is below the minimum level recorded in 1993. It’s a critical situation,” Cuartas says. “The Itaipu basin is used not only for power generation, but also for water supply.”
Recent rains in the south may bring temporary relief to agriculture, but water conditions take time to return to normal. “Rainfall would have to be at average levels or above for several months for the water system to start recovering and resume expected levels,” Cuartas says.
Agribusiness has been suffering losses as a result of drought, but it also contributes to the changes in the water regime. Deforesting the Amazon to establish cattle ranches, plantations and logging reduces precipitation in Brazil and other Latin American countries. With deforestation increasing, agribusiness and power generation may collapse in Brazil.
The Amazon Forest works as a cooling system. On a single day, a robust tree with its 20-meter (66-foot) canopy pumps around 1,100 liters (290 gallons) of water into the atmosphere. These masses of air carrying vapor from the forest’s transpiration are called “flying rivers.” They take humidity from the Amazon Basin to Brazil’s center-west, southeast and south regions as well as to neighboring countries. With fewer trees in the forest, there is less humidity in the air. And that leads to drought.",https://news.mongabay.com/2020/08/deforestation-in-the-amazon-is-drying-up-the-rest-of-brazil-report/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"A severe drought in the Czech Republic, which has reached historic levels in its fifth year, is worrying growers as it increasingly hits agriculture.
Scientists say the current series of drought, which began in 2015, is the worst in 500 years.
The temperature spikes have hit hardest in the eastern regions of Moravia and Silesia and the dry spell has forced many farmers to adapt fast. Some have had to cut fruit and wine grape production by 40 per cent.
In Central Bohemia — also hit hard — one grower, Lubo? Hrabánek of Farma Zadní Kopanina, says he has restructured his land to deal with the conditions.
He’s using smaller tracts for growing than the traditional multi-hectare square sectors that date from the communist days.
Hrabánek runs a family farm in the Bohemian Karst area whose main activity is animal production and breeding cattle, pigs and chickens. His four 10-hectare tracts also produce alfalfa, cereals and sometimes corn feed for his animals.
Despite recent rains, which have helped somewhat, Hrabánek has been “strongly impacted by the drought”, he said.
“Long-term care and care of the soil is important. Maybe that's why we focus anxiously on the principle of regular crop rotation.”
Besides using ancestral methods, he said “we try to grow crops that are not very demanding on water. We have not yet had to resort to artificial irrigation”.
The farm’s strategy has allowed it to avoid produce price hikes so far. “Our goal is not to spew production at all costs,” says Hrabánek, adding that his operation tries to tailor production to local needs.
Another farmer in the region — who produces artisanal honey, beets and greens that he markets directly in Prague — says water scarcity has forced him to irrigate year-round.
“We’re one of the only farms in our area still growing vegetables,” he said, noting that pumping from wells gets harder every year. Tensions are growing with neighbouring farms as the water table falls, he added.
Makers of craft beer in the Czech Republic _ a product increasingly in demand at home and abroad _ say they’ve been watching the prices and availability of hops, the country’s most famous export.
A representative of Chroust craft beer says the company buys Bohemian hops for its prime lagers and has not yet seen prices rising but acknowledges “growers are being hit. It could happen at any time”.
Winter wheat is at risk, say many farmers, but corn, with deeper roots, has fared batter. Meanwhile, other crops are likely to be ploughed under, unless more rain arrives soon.
The drought has also harmed grass and alfalfa production, needed for cattle feed, notes Robert Ku?era of the Agrarian Chamber of Ostrava.
An agency set up to study the drought and provide data, Intersucho.cz, reports that the Moravian-Silesian Region is in “one of the worst situations” with extreme drought at levels not seen for the last 50 years.
Authorities are supplying some towns with water tanks this year as they did in 2019, as other add-on effects include the spread of bark beetles and Moravian winemakers planning for a future shift from white wine production to red grapes, which are less dependent on water.
As for the effects on consumers, it’s clear that grocery prices are up but less certain is what role the drought has played, said Patrik Rozumbersky of market analyst company UniCredit. Rising food prices have more likely been driven by effects of the coronavirus, which held up shipments of produce at the country’s borders. A shortage of agriculture workers, who were blocked from travelling to the country from the east, is also a likely culprit, according to Rozumbersky.
Grocery chains Billa and Albert declined to comment on price changes but Prague consumers did appear to bulk up on packaged goods, which may also have had an effect _ though the Czech Republic did not see binge buying at the level witnessed in the UK and US during the COVID-19 lockdowns.
Consumer food price rises were also in line with current inflation reports showing a rate of 7.8 per cent, a rise from last year’s 6.4 per cent rate, according to Rozumbersky.
Czech crop prices, he adds, depend not just on local production levels but on “the quality of harvest in the whole European continent as the price of individual products is formed on the international market”.
At the same time, said Rozumbersky, “I think that the possible effect of drought might become more intensive later in the year as soon as the impact on the harvest is clearer.”
Industry organisations have been cautioning farmers too: the Czech Agricultural Chamber calls groundwater levels “strongly below normal overall,” noting that 71 per cent of wells are at unusually low water depths.
In addition, low water levels have hit key watersheds in the upper Oh?e, Lu?ická Nisa and Smědá river basins, which the chamber calls “strongly below normal.” Also drying up are natural springs, of which 79 per cent are suffering from “with severe or extreme drought”.",https://www.euronews.com/2020/05/05/historic-czech-drought-worries-growers-and-scientists,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"The water crisis along the California-Oregon border went from dire to catastrophic this week as federal regulators shut off irrigation water to farmers from a critical reservoir and said they would not send extra water to dying salmon downstream or to a half-dozen wildlife refuges that harbor millions of migrating birds each year.
In what is shaping up to be the worst water crisis in generations, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation said it will not release water this season into the main canal that feeds the bulk of the massive Klamath Reclamation Project, marking a first for the 114-year-old irrigation system. The agency announced last month that hundreds of irrigators would get dramatically less water than usual, but a worsening drought picture means water will be completely shut off instead.
The entire region is in extreme or exceptional drought, according to federal monitoring reports, and Oregon’s Klamath County is experiencing its driest year in 127 years.
“This year’s drought conditions are bringing unprecedented hardship to the communities of the Klamath Basin,” said Reclamation Deputy Commissioner Camille Calimlim Touton, calling the decision one of “historic consequence.” “Reclamation is dedicated to working with our water users, tribes and partners to get through this difficult year and developing long-term solutions for the basin.”
The canal, a major component of the federally operated Klamath Reclamation Project, funnels Klamath River water from the Upper Klamath Lake just north of the Oregon-California border to more than 130,000 acres (52,600 hectares), where generations of ranchers and farmers have grown hay, alfalfa and potatoes and grazed cattle.
Only one irrigation district within the 200,000-acre (80,940-hectare) project will receive any water from the Klamath River system this growing season, and it will have a severely limited supply, the Klamath Water Users Association said in a statement. Some other farmers rely on water from a different river, and they will also have a limited supply.
“This just couldn’t be worse,” said Klamath Irrigation District president Ty Kliewer. “The impacts to our family farms and these rural communities will be off the scale.”
At the same time, the agency said it would not release any so-called “flushing flows” from the same dam on the Upper Klamath Lake to bolster water levels downstream in the lower Klamath River. The river is key to the survival of coho salmon, which are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. In better water years the pulses of water help keep the river cool and turbulent — conditions that help the fragile species.

drought,,"Ongoing drought in Idaho will drastically shorten this year’s irrigation season for some farmers, officials said.
Farmers in south-central Idaho’s Wood River basin will face some of the biggest shortages, with an estimated 40 to 45 days before water from the Magic Reservoir runs out, according to David Stephenson, manager of Big Wood Canal Co. In a normal season, farmers might get water into late September.
Magic Reservoir, which supplies water to 36,000 acres of farmland, was only about a quarter full this year before dams were released last week, kicking off the season.
The reservoir holds water that flows through Big Wood River from melted snowfall in the mountains. The river is flowing at about 16% of its normal rate this year after record-low winter precipitation levels, Boise State Public Radio reported.
Prior to the winter, a dry summer and fall last year meant groundwater was already depleted as irrigators south of Bellevue pumped out of the aquifer, searching for any leftover moisture.
Carl Pendleton, a farmer who gets all of his water from Magic Reservoir, said the outlook is dismal.
“I sold my cow herd last week, the first time I’ve been out of livestock in my lifetime,” he said. “That’s the decisions we’re making based on this amount of water.”
The Idaho Department of Water Resources this spring could decide to curtail groundwater pumping to the north, which Pendleton said goes unchecked and exacerbates the shortages so that there isn’t enough to go around.

drought,,"The mighty Rio Grande is looking less mighty as U.S. forecasters predict spring flows will be less than half of average — or worse — and that signals potential trouble for the already stressed waterway.
One of the longest rivers in North America, the Rio Grande delivers drinking water and irrigation supplies to millions of people from southern Colorado into Texas and Mexico under a decades-old water-sharing agreement. With more dry years than wet ones over the last two decades, how much water ends up flowing downstream has been a point of contention among the states.
As New Mexico and Texas battle over their shares before the U.S. Supreme Court, forecasters with the federal government’s Natural Resources Conservation Service say river and stream flows across New Mexico have dropped noticeably following a somewhat dry March.

drought,,"A two-decade-long dry spell that has parched much of the western United States is turning into one of the deepest megadroughts in the region in more than 1,200 years, a new study found.
And about half of this historic drought can be blamed on man-made global warming, according to a study in Thursday’s journal Science.
Scientists looked at a nine-state area from Oregon and Wyoming down through California and New Mexico, plus a sliver of southwestern Montana and parts of northern Mexico. They used thousands of tree rings to compare a drought that started in 2000 and is still going — despite a wet 2019 — to four past megadroughts since the year 800.
With soil moisture as the key measurement, they found only one other drought that was as big and was likely slightly bigger. That one started in 1575, just 10 years after St. Augustine, the first European city in the United States, was founded, and that drought ended before the Pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock in 1620.
What’s happening now is “a drought bigger than what modern society has seen,” said study lead author A. Park Williams, a bioclimatologist at Columbia University.
Daniel Swain, a UCLA climate scientist who wasn’t part of the study, called the research important because it provides evidence “that human-caused climate change transformed what might have otherwise been a moderate long-term drought into a severe event comparable to the ‘megadroughts’ of centuries past.”",https://apnews.com/article/ut-state-wire-az-state-wire-id-state-wire-or-state-wire-nv-state-wire-d1f130f8826ef57c74db611e959937ac,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"Arizona is getting a jump start on what will be a yearslong process to address a dwindling but key water source in the U.S. West.
Several states and Mexico rely on the Colorado River for drinking water and growing crops. But climate change, drought and demand have taken a toll on the river that no longer can deliver what was promised in the 1920s.
Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, California, Utah, Wyoming and Nevada have been operating under a set of guidelines approved in 2007. Those guidelines and an overlapping drought contingency plan will expire in 2026.
Arizona water officials gathered Thursday to outline a plan for what comes next. Other states in the river basin have had more informal discussions.
“Hold on to your seats because the reconsultation will be technical and complicated, and it will take a long time,” said Ted Cooke, general manager of the Central Arizona Project, who is co-chairing Arizona’s effort.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation is reviewing the effectiveness of the 2007 guidelines that address shortages and surpluses of water, and efforts to conserve water in Lake Mead along the Nevada-Arizona border. A draft is expected in August, and a final report in December.
“It’s prudent water management to review how well something has worked before determining what might replace it,” said Carly Jerla of the Bureau of Reclamation.
When those guidelines went into effect, the river had been in drought conditions for several years. It hasn’t let up. A drought contingency plan approved by the Western states last year was meant as a stop-gap. It requires Arizona, Nevada and Mexico to prop up Lake Mead earlier than under the 2007 guidelines. It also looped in California for water cuts.
A Reclamation audit published last month found that water use in the Colorado River’s lower basin dropped by more than 575,000 acre-feet from 2018 to 2019, a level not seen since 1986. That allowed Lake Mead and Lake Powell — key indicators of the river’s health — to increase by several feet but both remain well below capacity.
As of this week, Mead was 41% full. Powell, along the Arizona-Utah line, was 53% full.
Arizona is looking to build upon the work done on the drought contingency plan. The committee of about three dozen people that worked it helps develop what might replace the existing guidelines, focusing on how to sustain the river while meeting the state’s water needs, officials said.",https://apnews.com/article/nv-state-wire-droughts-ut-state-wire-az-state-wire-ca-state-wire-2476176178f44b71aa92f5a4215405ba,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lack of rain has already left 500,000 people - one in five Namibians - without access to enough food, the government says.
The sparsely-populated country has seen a succession of droughts since 2013.
The government had set aside 40m (30m) to buy food and water tanks, and to transport livestock to and from grazing areas.
Prime Minister Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila has appealed for international help.

Two thirds of the crops planted last season failed, while Ngamiland, a rich beef producing region, has recorded nearly 40,000 cattle deaths.
Rancher Casper Matsheka says there was no food or water, so his animals starved to death.
“The goats died, as well as the cattle, as you can see the carcasses all over. We were really affected. If only the government could subsidize the prices of feed and vaccines for the livestock during such times,” he said.

drought,,"The severe drought that struck California from 2011 to 2015 had an obvious impact on rivers, forests, and wildlife. Now, a new study shows it also had some surprising effects on the state’s notorious air pollution, adding new wrinkles to the state’s efforts to clear the skies.
Researchers have long known that plants can both help create and cleanse one dangerous air pollutant: ground-level ozone, which causes breathing problems and exacerbates lung damage. Plants can scrub ozone from the air by absorbing the pollutant through their stomata, or pores. But certain plants also emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that react with other atmospheric chemicals to create ozone.
Understanding how drought influences these two processes can be tricky. Dry conditions could cause ozone levels to rise, because plants shrink their stomata to prevent water loss, reducing their ability to remove pollution. But drought might also reduce ozone levels, because the stress could cause plants to produce fewer ozone-forming VOCs.
California’s lengthy drought, and the state’s extensive network of air pollution sensors, gave researchers a rare opportunity to see what happens in the real world. The team, led by atmospheric chemistry Ph.D. candidate Angelique Demetillo and environmental science professor Sally Pusede at the University of Virginia (UVA) in Charlottesville, examined more than a decade’s worth of satellite and sensor data that documented atmospheric conditions over Bakersfield and Fresno, two California cities that suffer from ozone pollution.
The drought’s impact on air quality changed over time, the researchers report this week in Environmental Science & Technology. Plants did remove less ozone, with absorption dropping by about 15% during the most severe years of the drought. But during the early years of the drought, trees and other plants were able to maintain their production of one key ozone-forming VOC, isoprene. The chemical helps plants like oak trees withstand heat stress, and it appears the trees draw on carbon stores to sustain isoprene production. “It’s like a person exercising; when you’ve burned through your recent consumption the body switches over and starts burning fat,” says Manuel Lerdau, an organismal ecologist at UVA and a co-author of the study.
After about 4 years of drought, however, the stress took its toll. In 2013, plant isoprene levels fell dramatically, by 65% in Bakersfield and 54% in Fresno. Overall, that meant up to a 20% dip in ozone pollution. And even after the drought ended, isoprene levels didn’t immediately rebound.
The plant VOC reduction might sound like good news for reducing California’s smog. But the complexity of atmospheric chemistry means droughts could actually complicate clean air efforts. That’s because, currently, regulations mostly focus on controlling nitrogen oxides (NOx) from sources like cars and factories, which react with VOCs to form ozone. When VOC levels are higher, those NOx controls help choke off smog-creating reactions. But reduce the VOCs, and NOx limits go from “being very effective to less effective,” Pusede says.
Such findings offer yet another complication for U.S. states and cities struggling to meet federal clean air standards, especially in drought-prone western states. Regulators have little ability to control VOC emissions from plants, notes Pusede, and “I don’t know if we’d want to even if we could.” But the study could help regulators do a better job of factoring drought into their air pollution models.
The work also “provides a road map for better quantifying these impacts in other places,” says atmospheric scientist Jessica Neu of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, who reviewed the paper. And because much of the needed data can now be collected by satellites, she says it opens the door to investigating “drought impacts on air quality globally.”",https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/04/drought-not-just-about-water-it-affects-air-pollution-too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"About 42% of India’s land area is facing drought, with 6% exceptionally dry--four times the spatial extent of drought last year, according to data for the week ending March 26, 2019, from the Drought Early Warning System (DEWS), a real-time drought monitoring platform.
Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Maharashtra, parts of the North-East, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Telangana are the worst hit. These states are home to 500 million people, almost 40% of the country’s population.
While the central government has not declared drought anywhere so far, the state governments of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Odisha and Rajasthan have declared many of their districts as drought-hit.
“Before monsoon, which is still far away, the next two or three months are going to be difficult in many of these regions,” Vimal Mishra, associate professor at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Gandhinagar, and the developer of DEWS, told IndiaSpend.
Failed monsoon rains are the primary reason for the current situation. The North-East monsoon, also known as ‘post-monsoon rainfall’ (October-December) that provides 10-20% of India’s rainfall, was deficient by 44% in 2018 from the long-term normal of 127.2 mm, as per data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD). This compounded the rainfall deficit in the South-West (SW) monsoon (June-September) that provides 80% of India’s rainfall, which fell short by 9.4% in 2018--close to the 10% deficit range when the IMD declares a drought.
India has experienced widespread drought every year since 2015, Mishra said, with the exception of 2017. As the El Nino--the unusual warming of the equatorial Pacific Ocean that makes Indian summers warmer and reduces rainfall--looms over the 2019 SW monsoon, pre-monsoon showers (March-May) this year have also been deficient. India has received 36% less rainfall than the long-term average between March 1 and March 28, 2019, as per IMD data. The southern peninsular region recorded the lowest, a deficit greater than 60%.
Lower rainfall has reduced water levels in reservoirs across the country. The amount of water available in the country’s 91 major reservoirs has gone down 32 percentage points over five months to March 22, 2019. In 31 reservoirs of southern states, water level has gone down by 36 percentage points over five months.
The drought could further worsen farm distress, exacerbate groundwater extraction, increase migration from rural to urban areas, and further inflame water conflicts between states and between farms, cities and industries.
Yet, the latest drought manual issued in 2016 by the central government makes the process of declaring drought long and difficult, experts say, with the result that drought may go officially unannounced. This means relief measures such as drinking water supply, subsidised diesel and electricity for irrigation, increased number of days of insured work under National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) are not taken. And elections may further delay government acknowledgement and action.

drought,,"Residents call this drought-stricken community a “forgotten town.”
The flat, dusty roads to Vosburg are surrounded by withered fields. The streams feeding the community of a few thousand people have gone dry. Signs warn drivers of wandering cattle and sheep but there are none in sight.
The months-long drought is affecting most of southern Africa. The United Nations estimates that more than 11 million people now face crisis levels of food insecurity in places like Zimbabwe and Mozambique, where two cyclones wiped out crops earlier this year.
Among the hardest hit areas is South Africa’s Northern Cape province, where many farmers are struggling to keep their families and animals alive while revenue falls and debt piles up.
Commercial sheep farmer Louis van der Merwe, 64, broke down as he described losing more than 400 sheep and 450 springboks in the past two years because of the worst drought he has seen in 45 years of farming.
Some animals died of hunger. Others were sent prematurely to the slaughterhouse to reduce the number to feed. With tears running down his face, Van der Merwe said he now relies on donations of animal feed so the rest can survive.
“If we didn’t have hope, we would not be here anymore,” he said. “We have to have hope and faith. There are a couple of times when we have felt it is not worth it.”
Two of his fellow farmers have killed themselves due to the stress, Van der Merwe said.
Northern Cape province will need over 28 million in drought relief over the next three months to assist 15,500 affected farms, according to farmers’organization Agri-SA.
So far, South Africa’s government has pledged 2 million.
The World Food Program says southern Africa has received normal rainfall in just one of the past five growing seasons, with small-scale farmers feeling it most.

drought,,"evere to extreme drought is expected to hit countries in the lower Mekong basin from now until January 2020, warns the Mekong River Commission. Thailand and Cambodia would be hardest hit compared to Lao PDR and Viet Nam.    
Preliminary analysis of MRC’s data has shown that the draught is caused by insufficient rainfall during the wet season with a delayed arrival and earlier departure of the monsoon rain and an El Nino event that has created an abnormally high temperature and high evapotranspiration. 
During a normal year, the monsoon rain usually starts in late May and ends in October. But this year, it began almost two weeks late and departed about three weeks earlier. 
“This year’s prolonged dry weather condition can possibly adversely impact agricultural and crop production. The issue of water shortages for consumption could also come into play as the drought persists,” said Dr. Lam Hung Son, the MRC Secretariat’s Head of Regional Flood and Drought Management Center, who led the analysis.  
Using a three-month timeframe, the analysis looked at both the probability and degree of drought and rainfall occurrences compared with historical data called the standardized precipitation index (SPI), and the degree of dryness of the top soil layer known as the combined drought index (CDI) in the four MRC Member States: Lao PDR, Cambodia, Thailand and VietNam.",https://www.mrcmekong.org/news-and-events/news/drought-continues-to-hit-mekong-countries-risking-stress-on-crop-production-water-shortage/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"Drought is a pretty complicated climate extreme to define. Most commonly, it is defined as a precipitation deficit - much less precipitation falls than what is typically expected for a given time period.
But drought can be observed in lots of ways: lack of snowpack, low flows in rivers and streams, dry soils, higher evaporative losses, low lake/reservoir levels, etc. Because the climate varies all the time, it’s a safe assumption to say that all areas experience drought similarly because all areas will see times when precipitation is (or the other water variables) less than average.
But drought is not equally distributed across the U.S. Just as there are climatologically wetter areas and drier areas across the country, the same could be said about the occurrence, frequency, and severity of drought.
So, some might be asking, ""where are the most 'drought-prone' areas?
Drought-Prone States
First, let's look at the states that experience drought most often, according to data from the U.S. Drought Monitor.
The Drought Monitor has been tracking drought conditions across the country since 2000.
Each week, the map is updated with the latest conditions ranging from none, to D0 (which is an “abnormally dry” category), to D1-D4 (which represents increasing severities of drought categories).
How the map is made is a big process that includes analysis of data that encompasses local/regional variability in all the water variables and adds a human component, like impacts.",https://www.drought.gov/news/how-drought-prone-your-state-look-top-states-and-counties-drought-over-last-two-decades,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"A potent combination of record-breaking heat and a lack of rain has led to the rapid development of drought across the southeastern United States and Tennessee and Ohio Valleys during September 2019. Coming off an extremely wet 2018 east of the Rockies, the fast onset of widespread extensive drought has been quite the climate whiplash for millions across the Southeast.  With warmer than average temperatures expected to continue and October being a generally dry month based on climatology, drought conditions are likely to continue and possibly expand and intensify over the next week.
The extent to which drought has overtaken the southeastern United States by the end of September would have been hard to explain to residents of the region just a month prior.  While a few localized areas in Georgia/Alabama were already mired in drought, the broader region extending into the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys was drought free. In fact, the twelve-month period (September 2018-August 2019) coming to an end was record wet. But then, while it continued to be hot, things turned incredibly dry.
The rapid onset and severity of the event qualified it as a “Flash drought.” Generally, droughts are caused by a lack of precipitation over an extended period of time. In contrast, a flash drought is preceded not just by a lack of rain, but also very high temperatures and/or lots of sunny days. Even if the dry period is not especially severe, the latter two can suck moisture from the ground quickly.
For operational purposes, NOAA National Weather Service’s Climate Prediction Center defines a flash drought as an event during which an area experiences degradation by two or more drought categories in a four week period, based on the U.S. Drought Monitor.",https://www.climate.gov/news-features/event-tracker/flash-drought-engulfs-us-southeast-september-2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"An estimated 45 million people are threatened with hunger by a severe drought strangling wide stretches of southern Africa.
Emergency food deliveries are planned for parts of South Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe and other countries hard hit by a combination of low rainfall and high temperatures.
“We are witnessing millions of already poor people facing extreme food insecurity and exhausting their reserves because of compounding climate shocks that hit already vulnerable communities hardest. They need help urgently,” said Nellie Nyang’wa, southern Africa director for the international aid agency, Oxfam.
“The scale of the drought devastation across southern Africa is staggering.”
Parts of Zimbabwe have had the lowest rainfall since 1981, contributing to making more than 5.5 million at risk of extreme food insecurity, Oxfam said in a report released Thursday.
Zambia’s rich maize-growing area has been hit hard and exports are now banned; 2.3 million people there are food-insecure, according to Oxfam and the Zambia Red Cross. The drought is also worsening food availability in Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, Madagascar and Namibia, Oxfam said.
Southern Africa has received normal rainfall in just one of the past five growing seasons, which particularly hits the small-scale farmers who depend on rain for their crops, the U.N. World Food Program said last week. The U.N. food agencies plan to distribute emergency food aid to 11 million people in the coming months.
Two cataclysmic cyclones hit Mozambique, Zimbabwe and other southern African countries early this year, wiping out crops of maize and other staple crops. Without normal rainfall, subsistence farmers are hard-pressed to recover from the destruction caused by the tropical storms.
“The successive mixture of drought and flooding has been catastrophic for many communities. In most of the affected areas there isn’t enough drinking water, which means that people and animals — both livestock and wildlife — are having to use the same water points,” said Kaitano Chungu, Secretary General of the Zambia Red Cross.
“This is unacceptable as it exposes people to diseases and creates a heightened risk of animal attacks.”
Some families in the worst-affected areas are surviving the food shortage by eating wild fruits and roots, Chungu said.
The drought has also affected the region’s wildlife. At least 105 elephants have died in Zimbabwe as a result of lack of water and vegetation, according to Zimbabwe’s National Parks.",https://www.africanews.com/2019/11/08/southern-africa-drought-threatens-estimated-45-million-people/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"A historic drought in Chennai, the sixth-largest city in India, is so severe that it’s now visible from space.
The city’s 4.6 million citizens are rationing every drop of water, restaurants are closing early and companies are scaling back their operations as Chennai tries to survive a heat wave with 99 per cent less water than it had at the same time last year. The state government is shipping in water on trucks, but those trucks can’t replace the now dried-up lakes that once fed the city.
Everyone is asking the same question: When will the monsoons start?
Satellite footage released earlier this month shows the city’s four reservoirs, including nearby Lake Puzhal, have severely shrunk since last June. The reservoirs have a capacity of 318.8 billion litres, but they are down to a collective 651 million litres, according to government data reported by the Hindustan Times. The reservoirs have been reduced to 0.2 per cent of their capacity, according to state government data.
The city typically relies on the heavy rainfall of monsoon season to replenish its water supply, which comes from four lakes and groundwater reservoirs in the region. The monsoons usually start in June but they’ve been delayed this year, leaving citizens with little water amid blistering temperatures that exceed 40 C each day.
The problem dates back to last year, when Chennai saw a major shortfall in its monthly rainfall. The city received 80 per cent less rain than average in December alone, according to India’s weather office.
Temperatures in Chennai typically peak in May and June, around the same time that rainfall starts picking up. February, March and April are typically drought season, while the heaviest monsoon rains come in October, November and December.

drought,,"A recent JRC article warns that the extreme drought conditions that affected central and northern Europe's 2018 spring/summer growing season could become the norm within 25 years, and calls for innovative adaptation measures to deal with extremes.
The 2018 spring and summer months were marked by a unique combination of drought conditions in central and northern Europe, and unusually wet conditions in southern Europe.
For instance, Germany was affected by a 6-month drought which lasted the whole spring and summer, while the spring was particularly wet in the Iberian Peninsula.
Both extremes affected crop yields. The droughts resulted into total reductions in the main crop yields of up to 50%.
This was partially offset by southern Europe's yield gains of up to 34%.
This juxtaposition of opposite climate anomalies  _ droughts in the Northern part of Europe and unusually wet condition in the South, sometimes referred to as the ""water seesaw"" _ was  a unique phenomenon of the last 500 years.
 Future climate projections, based on high resolution global models, show that southern Europe is less likely to experience such favourably wet conditions for crop growth in the future.

drought,,"Alaska’s wettest region is experiencing an extreme drought for the first time in recorded history, climate scientists say.
The southernmost portion of Southeast Alaska, including Ketchikan, Prince of Wales Island, Wrangell and Metlakatla, has been in a drought for the last two years, said Rick Thoman, a climatologist at the Fairbanks-based Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy.
Last week, though, the drought was updated to a D3, or “extreme” drought, the second-highest category the U.S. Drought Monitor measures. It’s the first time those conditions have ever been recorded in Alaska, according to the Drought Monitor.
Meanwhile, areas experiencing lesser “severe” and “moderate” droughts on the Panhandle have expanded, the Drought Monitor said.
Droughts look different in the rainforest climate of Southeast Alaska than elsewhere in the world, though, with the key difference being that the region is still getting quite a lot of precipitation by most standards, Thoman said.
Ketchikan has averaged about 100 inches annually since 2017, and Metlakatla has seen between 80 and 90, climatologists say.
“In the mass amount of the world that would be an immense amount of rain,” Thoman said.
However, that’s still drastically less than what’s normal for the region. Ketchikan normally averages 150 inches of precipitation a year, and Metlakatla 118.

Two days earlier, Sakharam Landge was ploughing his farm near Umarkheda village in Jalna district. It was 42 degrees Celsius in the shade, a hot wind was blowing away the topsoil his tractor churned up, and he was not sure he would be able to sow any crop this summer. “But what else can I do,” he said. “My grandfather, my father, all the elders in the village said we must plough our farms in the first half of June, so that we can sow our Kharif (summer) crop as soon as the rains arrive on June 15.”
A farmer in his early forties, Landge is perfectly aware that the monsoon rains have not been arriving on June 15 in recent years. Of the 18 summer monsoons this millennium in Marathwada _ a region where the overwhelming majority of farmers have no irrigation facilities _ ten have caused droughts and one a flood. As the monsoon winds bring rainfall from the Arabian Sea to India’s west coast, Marathwada is also in the rain shadow of the Western Ghats _ a mountain chain along the coast _ and has always been a low rainfall area.

Within this, ‘severe to exceptionally dry conditions’ prevailed in 17.33 per cent area, according to the real-time drought monitoring platform.
While just 0.65 per cent of area had ‘exceptionally dry’ conditions in June 2018, it has now jumped to 5.87 per cent, stated the latest data.
Further, the delay in southwest monsoons has worsened the drought index, the DEWS reported.
In the June 6 update, real-time platform recorded 43.02 per cent area under ‘abnormally to exceptionally dry’ conditions. However, the latest data showed an increase (44.17 per cent). 
Similarly, percentage of area under ‘extremely dry to exceptional dry’ increased from 10.83 to 11.22 per cent during the same period.

The deficit is prevalent across the country with south India having a deficit of 47 per cent, followed by northwest India (30 per cent), central India (18 per cent), and east and northeast (14 per cent).
The month of June, which accounts for 18 per cent of rain, may end up with a deficit of 40 per cent in at least 66 districts across the country, warned Skymet Weather, a private weather forecasting agency.
The low rainfall would be difficult to make up for the deficit in coming months, it noted.
According to the IMD, there is also a possibility of weaker monsoon in July. It could be a great cause of worry, as the month is crucial and receives one third of the total monsoon rains in the country. 
The sluggish pace of the south west monsoon has compounded the severe dry spell. As a result, at least 30 sub-divisions are likely to experience ‘deficient’ and ‘largely deficient’ monsoon season, the IMD said.
Most of these are in Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, and the north eastern states. Only four sub-divisions in Karnataka, Gujarat, and Lakshadweep have witnessed ‘normal’ rainfall.
Low rainfall has also contributed to a downward trend in water levels in at least 71 of 91 reservoirs across India, a recent bulletin by the Central Water Commission (CWC), has showed.

According to the monitor’s weekly report for late last week, only 20.5% of Arizona was showing moderate drought or “abnormally dry” symptoms.

The country has seen extremely high temperatures in recent weeks. On Monday the capital, Delhi, saw its highest ever June temperature of 48C. In Rajasthan, the city of Churu recently experienced highs of 50.8C, making it the hottest place on the planet.
Further south, less than 250 miles from the country’s commercial capital, Mumbai, village after village lies deserted. Estimates suggest up to 90% of the area’s population has fled, leaving the sick and elderly to fend for themselves in the face of a water crisis that shows no sign of abating.
The village of Hatkarwadi, about 20 miles from Beed in Maharashtra state, is almost completely deserted.
Wells and handpumps have run dry in the 45C heatwave. The drought, which officials say is worse than the 1972 famine that affected 25 million people across the state, began early in December. By the end of May, Hatkarwadi had been deserted with only 10-15 families remaining out of a population of more than 2,000.

According to IMD, the monsoon was 39% deficient till June 22 despite marginal improvement over the last week. In its Sunday bulletin, the national weather forecaster said the monsoon advanced into parts of central Maharashtra, Marathwada and Vidarbha, remaining areas of Karnataka, Telangana, Odisha, Jharkhand, Gangetic West Bengal and Bihar, most parts of Chhattisgarh, and some areas of eastern Uttar Pradesh.

More than 10 million people are thought to be affected across the region.
The UN now classifies large areas of Somalia, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Kenya as a crisis or an emergency.
Charity Save the Children says drought and war in Somalia has led to unprecedented numbers fleeing across the border into Kenya, with about 1,300 people arriving every day.
Three camps at Dadaab, just inside Kenya, are home to well over 350,000 people, but they were built to hold just 90,000 and are severely overcrowded.
A prolonged failure of rains, which began in late 2010, is now taking its toll.
The UN's Office for the Co-Ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) warns that the situation is continuing to deteriorate, and the number of people in need will continue to increase.
The numbers now affected are huge, Ohca says: 3.2m in Ethiopia, 3.2m in Kenya, 2.6m in Somalia and more than 100,000 in Djibouti.
Every month during 2011, about 15,000 Somalis have fled their country, arriving in Kenya and Ethiopia, according to Ocha.
While conflict has been a fact of life for them for years, it is the drought that has brought them to breaking point. Many have walked for days, are exhausted, in poor health, desperate for food and water.
The UN refugee agency is dealing with the exodus.
A new refugee camp primarily for Somalis was opened at Kobe in Ethiopia last Friday, near an existing camp at Melkadida.
More than 3,500 refugees and their belongings were moved there over the weekend.
The UNHCR says this is the sixth camp for Somalis in Ethiopia, which is currently housing some 130,000 displaced people.
Food prices have risen substantially across the region, pushing many moderately poor households over the edge.
The price of grain in affected areas in Kenya is 30-80% above average.
The spokeswoman for Ocha, Elizabeth Byrs, said appeals for Somalia and Kenya, each about 525m (328m), are barely 50% funded, while a 30m appeal for Djibouti has raised just 30% of the needed funds.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13944550,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"Millions of people in the Horn of Africa are facing severe shortages of food as the worst drought in the region for six decades withers crops and kills livestock, as the BBC's world affairs correspondent Mike Wooldridge reports.
""I had a herd of 200 cows. I took them to Ethiopia when the drought started. All the cows I had taken there died and I came back without a single cow.""
That story told by a resident of Wajir district in northern Kenya might not immediately appear to symbolise the humanitarian emergency increasingly gripping swathes of East Africa and the Horn of Africa - in the way that the rapidly growing number of acutely malnourished children trekking out of Somalia does.
But the distress being experienced by pastoralist communities across the affected region also goes a long way in explaining the severity of the current drought, its impact and the limits to the strategies people use to try to protect their livelihoods in such circumstances.
The Wajir cattle herder acted when he saw the grazing for his precious animals drying up.
But in the area of Ethiopia he took them to there turned out to be no greater chance of saving them. They started dropping dead, he says, one by one.
Aid officials estimate that up to half a million cattle have been lost in Ethiopia this year.
It often takes pastoralists at least two years to recover from a severe drought, particularly where it means building up a milking herd again.
This year's drought has hit hard when many people have not yet recovered from the last serious drought in 2009.

Since last September, the province has had 60% less rainfall than normal. According to the Ministry of Civil Affairs, 8.1 million people — 18% of Yunnan's population — are short of drinking water, and US2.5-billion worth of crops are expected to fail.
Scientists in China say that the crisis marks one of the strongest case studies so far of how climate change and poor environmental practice can combine to create a disaster. They are now scrambling to pin down exactly what caused the drought, and whether similar events are likely to hit the region more often in the future.
Meanwhile, with most of the province's winter crops ruined, local farmers need immediate help. Zhu has been going from county to county to persuade farmers to grow different crops together in the same field, rather than as a monoculture. Intercropping can boost yields by up to 30%, and could help to avoid food shortages in the region later this year1. This summer, 80% of the farmland in Yunnan — a staggering 2.9 million hectares — will use the technique. But success will depend on a break in the weather.

drought,,"The number of people facing severe food shortages is set to increase as the impact of drought, along with high food and fuel prices, continues to grip the Horn of Africa region, FAO warned today.
High levels of acute malnutrition are widespread and more than 8 million people in Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia are in need of emergency assistance.
The region has now experienced two consecutive seasons of significantly below-average rainfall, resulting in failed crop production, depletion of grazing resources and significant livestock mortality.
Chronic crisis
""The current crisis is not an unusual or chance event, but rather a chronic feature of the region. The challenge ahead is to empower farmers and pastoralists to adapt to the new realities of high variability of weather patterns and more frequent extreme weather events,"" said Rod Charters, Regional Emergency Coordinator for Eastern and Central Africa.
""Together with our partners of the Regional Food Security and Nutrition Working Group we have been preparing for this drought scenario since the failure of last year's short rains. FAO issued various alerts and has been supporting countries' preparedness plans in the Region.""
In Somalia, malnutrition rates are amongst the worst in the world, with one in four children in southern Somalia acutely malnourished. The drought is affecting most parts of the country, leading to livestock deaths and sky-rocketing food prices which make it increasingly difficult for poor families to feed themselves.
Currently, 2.5 million people _ one in three Somalis _ are in need of humanitarian assistance but with the ongoing conflict in the South, coupled with the poor outlook for the upcoming harvest, many more Somalis may fall into severe crisis.
In Kenya, more than 2.4 million people in the pastoralist and agropastoralist areas of northern and northeastern regions are estimated to be unable to meet their basic food and water needs. The food security situation is expected to further deteriorate as milk production in the drought-affected areas has collapsed and will not recover until October when the short rains are expected to start.
Furthermore, distances to water have doubled to 30-40 kms in many areas and conflicts have occurred over grazing resources, leading to loss of human lives and livestock, along with constrained market access. Emergency interventions are urgently required to mitigate the impact and protect further livelihood and nutritional deterioration.
In Ethiopia, a La Ni?a episode has resulted in the failure of two consecutive seasons of rain, water shortages, very poor pasture and marked deterioration in livestock conditions resulting in much reduced livestock prices in south and southeastern lowlands. In Borena Zone, on the southern border with Kenya, 220 000 cattle deaths have been reported. 
Additionally, the drought has also affected the 2011 ""belg"" cropping season to be harvested in June/July, which is expected to be very poor in the Oromia, Tigray, Ahmara and SNNP (Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples) regions.
At the beginning of June the number of people requiring assistance in Ethiopia was estimated at 11.4 million.  This includes 3.2 million people in need of emergency assistance and the 8.2 million people registered under the productive safety net programme.
In Djibouti, the ongoing drought coupled with very high staple food prices, high unemployment and increased rural-urban migration has worsened the food security situation at the household level.

drought,,"The United Nations refugee agency said today that with the increasing gravity of the situation in Somalia, where hundreds of thousands of people are suffering because of drought and conflict, it was stepping up assistance with aid distributions across the country’s central and southern parts.
Adrian Edwards, a spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), told a news briefing in Geneva that “although access remains a serious impediment, working with partners on the ground in Somalia we have so far distributed assistance packages to some 90,000 people in Mogadishu and Belet Hawa and Dobley in southwest Somalia.”
The agency is handing out non-food aid for an estimated 126,000 people in other parts of the Gedo and Lower Juba region to the west, with assistance also on its way to Mogadishu and the Afgooye corridor just west of Mogadishu, as well as further southwest in the Lower Shabelle area, Mr. Edwards said.
The agency is strengthening its mechanisms for tracking population movement and protection monitoring in the corridors leading to the Dolo Ado and Dadaab refugee camps in Ethiopia and Kenya respectively.
“Our aim is that through shorter interval reporting we’ll be better able to inform emergency interventions,” Mr. Edwards said. “UNHCR is the primary provider of this information to UN agencies and NGOs operating in Somalia.”
“Given the very serious health state of many refugees arriving at camps in neighbouring countries, UNHCR believes it is of life-saving importance that people in Somalia are able to get help where they need it,” he said. “This may, in certain circumstances, mitigate the necessity to cross borders into neighbouring countries, where refugee camps were already bursting at the seams.”

drought,,"In some areas of Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia and Uganda, drought conditions are the worst in 60 years, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in an update.
Almost half the of children arriving in refugees camps in Ethiopia from southern Somalia are malnourished, while 11 districts in Kenya have reported malnutrition rates above the 15 per cent emergency threshold. Supplementary and therapeutic feeding programmes are struggling to keep pace with the rising needs, according to OCHA.
Drought-related displacement and refugee flows are on the rise, with an average of 15,000 Somalis arriving in Kenya and Ethiopia every month this year seeking assistance.
“While conflict has been a fact of life for them for years, it is the drought that has taken them to breaking point. Many have walked for days, are exhausted, in poor health, desperate for food and water, and arriving in a worse condition than usual,” according to the OCHA update on the drought situation in the region.
The influx of Somalis into refugee camps in the Dadaab area of Kenya’s North-Eastern province _ the largest refugee settlement in the world _ has led to worsening overcrowding amid limited resources.
The drought has forced children out of school as both human and livestock diseases spread. Competition for the meagre resources is causing tensions among communities.
The price of grain in drought-affected areas of Kenya is 30 to 80 per cent more than the five-year average, according to OCHA, while in Ethiopia, the consumer price index for food increased by almost 41 per cent last month. Further food price hikes area expected in Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda and Somalia, but could ease after the next harvests expected later this year.
OCHA called for the scaling up of the emergency response in all affected areas, urging governments, donors and relief agencies step up efforts to prevent further deterioration.
Further funding is also required to enable humanitarian agencies to provide the necessary assistance. UN agencies and the partners this year requested 529 million for Somalia, but only 50 per cent of that amount has been received.
In Kenya, where 525 million is required, about 54 per cent of that money has been obtained so far.

drought,,"Djibouti is one of the smallest countries on the African continent. Situated between Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia, the total population is approximately 820,000 people. These factors alone make it an easy country to overlook in the context of the current drought. Next to the emergency crises in Kenya and Somalia, the needs of the drought-affected population may seem insignificant. Yet this is not a sufficient reason to neglect Djiboutians who are asking for help.
The IFRC together with the Djibouti Red Crescent have been undergoing an assessment throughout the country, and the needs are quite real. In Garabtisan village, northern Djibouti, there are approximately 1500 people - including 300 children - who have been facing a drought for the past five years.
“There is no public school for our children”, explained Madina, a mother of nine children. “We used to have a Koranic school, but the last wind storm knocked down the tree where lessons took place. Now, there is no place for children to learn.” It is a symbolic loss for this community who are on the brink of an emergency crisis.
In Garabtisan village, women such as Madina have only 40 litres of water for a period of 2 to 3 days to support the needs of an entire family. The nearest water source requires that women walk the distance of 23km, or they wait for water delivery from the military stationed nearby. But with a community of 1500 people, it is simply impossible for the military to adequately service the needs of Garabtisan village without support. In addition to high food prices, geographical isolation and the depletion of livestock, their situation is increasingly desperate.
Access to health care is another critical problem for women and children in Garabtisan village. When a child falls ill, the community is unable to respond. Each month there are approximately 6 to 7 births, with a loss of 2 to 3 children. The mobile health clinic provided by the Ministry of Health faces significant logistical challenges to reach the community as needed.
Yet the people of Garabtisan have dignity. Their cultural traditions practice basic hygiene such as washing children’s hands before eating, or defecating away from the home. Madina clearly wants to be a good mother, and meet the basic needs of her children.
The Djibouti Red Crescent and IFRC recognise the clear needs in drought-affected areas such as Garabtisan village. The Government of Djibouti has claimed there are 120,000 in need of critical assistance in rural areas. This indicates that 1 out of 8 persons are in need of emergency aid.
However the response cannot be successful by one agency or government ministry alone. Joint action is needed in Djibouti, in order to meet the challenges of drought-affected communities. Although the figures may be comparatively small to the rest of the Horn of Africa, women and mothers in desperate need, such as Madina, should be enough to take action.",https://www.ifrc.org/ar/news-and-media/news-stories/africa/djibouti/drought-takes-hold-in-djibouti/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"The latest famine in Somalia has put a spotlight on the urgent need to develop national and regional drought policies, according to the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, which are jointly leading the international action to address the growing impact of droughts.
Drought is expected to continue in hard-hit southern Somalia during August and September, as well as parts of Ethiopia, Djibouti and Kenya, according to the latest WMO Climate Outlook Forum for the region, which provides regional climate forecasts. The IGAD Climate Prediction and Applications Centre (ICPAC) already called for preparedness for an ongoing long period of drought over parts of the equatorial region in its climate update for the Greater Horn of Africa on 15 January 2011.
Droughts have become more common over the past two decades. This is consistent with reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, stating that the world has become more drought-prone over the last 25 years, and will see an increased frequency of droughts in the future.
""Droughts do not happen overnight,"" said Luc Gnacadja, Executive Secretary of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), responding to the declaration of famine by the United Nations earlier this month. ""The UNCCD joins the calls on the international community to respond urgently to this crisis. At the same time, we stress the need for effective, long-term solutions to the root causes of famine in drought-prone regions, such as implementation of drought management systems and measures to stop desertification, which means land degradation in drylands.""
""We are moving forward quickly to provide integrated drought information to help decision-makers deal with drought, such as the one underway right now in East Africa,"" said Michel Jarraud, Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization. ""Drought is a serious and growing problem in many countries. Adaptation to drought, desertification and climate change urgently needs to be mainstreamed in national development policies.""
Mr Gnacadja visited Mr Jarraud at WMO earlier this month to discuss cooperation between the two organizations, following the UN declaration of famine for two provinces in southern Somalia on 13 July 2011.

drought,,"More anthills than blades of grass are visible in some of the cracked earth around Junction. The year-long drought has plagued the town — as it has the rest of the state — and for a painful, six-week stretch, Junction banned all outdoor watering.
Some 4.5 inches of rain earlier this month increased the flow of the Llano River, two forks of which meet at the town. But the water is still pretty low — and four panelists at the Texas Water Symposium last week brought some unwelcome news to the townspeople: It’s not going to get any better anytime soon.
“As the state climatologist, people ask me, ‘When’s it going to rain?’” said John Nielsen-Gammon, one of the panelists, who is a professor of meteorology at Texas A&M University and the state's climatologist.
The answer, according to Nielsen-Gammon, is “eventually,” but chances are the drought will last another year, possibly even another decade.
The weather, or lack thereof, can be attributed to La Nia, a cyclical weather pattern resulting in cooler waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Meteorologists say that although La Nia had faded by the summer, it has now returned and is strengthening.
In the past 12 months, Texas has seen 11.1 inches of rainfall on average, according to Nielsen-Gammon, and it broke a heat record for the country that was previously set during the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. Texas AgriLife Extension Service estimates the cost of the drought to be about 5.2 billion, and that estimate — already out of date because it was compiled two months ago — doesn’t include the impact to several kinds of crops and the forestry industry.
Junction, known as the land of living waters, has seen some of its streams dry up. In August, town officials say, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality told Junction to cease outdoor water use of any kind when the town of Llano downstream reported it was close to running out of water.",https://www.texastribune.org/2011/10/18/more-months-drought-ahead-texas/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Normally before being brought to market, cattle are penned in a rancher's best pasture to be fattened. The heavier the cow, the more the buyer pays.
But the animals at a recent Emory auction look pitiful. They're standing in 107-degree heat — that's in the shade — with their ribs showing, stressed out. It's been like this for the past nine weeks — no rain. Although these cows were bred for the heat, they weren't bred for this. They look absolutely baked.
If this were a normal year, an August cattle auction in Emory would see maybe 100 to 200 head. There are more than 700 head today. And that's down from the more than 1,000 head sold here every Tuesday for much of this summer. The sad truth is, East Texas is starting to run out of stock to sell.
Inside the auction room, buyers in jeans and cowboy hats, here from Michigan and Wisconsin, Tennessee and Alabama, raise their fingers in front of their chests to bid. One cow, one calf, one bull after another, until late into the night. The Lone Star State is emptying itself of its cattle.

drought,,"The United Nations’ food agency issued an alert on Tuesday warning that a severe drought was threatening the wheat crop in China, the world’s largest wheat producer, and resulting in shortages of drinking water for people and livestock.
China has been essentially self-sufficient in grain for decades, for national security reasons. Any move by China to import large quantities of food in response to the drought could drive international prices even higher than the record levels recently reached.
“China’s grain situation is critical to the rest of the world ? if they are forced to go out on the market to procure adequate supplies for their population, it could send huge shock waves through the world’s grain markets,” said Robert S. Zeigler, the director general of the International Rice Research Institute in Los Ba?os, in the Philippines.
The state-run news media in China warned Monday that the country’s major agricultural regions were facing their worst drought in 60 years. On Tuesday the state news agency Xinhua said that Shandong Province, a cornerstone of Chinese grain production, was bracing for its worst drought in 200 years unless substantial precipitation came by the end of this month.
World wheat prices are already surging, and they have been widely cited as one reason for protests in Egypt and elsewhere in the Arab world. A separate United Nations report last week said global food export prices had reached record levels in January.

Preliminary reports from the National Climatic Data Center indicate that July 2011 was the warmest month ever recorded statewide for Texas, with data going back to 1895, Nielsen-Gammon reports. The average temperature of 87.2 degrees broke the previous record of 86.5 degrees set in 1998. The June average temperature of 85.2 was a record for that month and now ranks fifth warmest overall.
Rainfall totals were also unusually light across the state. The July monthly total of 0.72 inches ranks third driest, surpassed by the 0.69 inches recorded in both 1980 and 2000.

A senior government lawyer, PS Narasimha, told the supreme court that a quarter of the country’s population, spread across 10 states, had been hit by drought after two consecutive years of weak monsoons.
Narasimha said the government had released funds to affected regions where a crippling shortage of rainfall had forced the rationing of drinking water to some communities.
As summer hits India, reports of families and farmers in remote villages walking long distances to find water after their wells dried up have dominated local media.
Narasimha gave the figures on Tuesday after an NGO filed a petition asking the top court to order Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government to step up relief to the hardest-hit areas.

Temperatures are in the low 40Cs in some areas, with others only cooling to 38C at night. It is worse for the poor in rural areas, who are forced to drink whatever water they can.
In 2015, the region received only 49 percent of what is considered a normal amount of rainfall.
Some parts received even less: a meagre 35 percent of normal rainfall.

drought,,"The ongoing spell of drought and severe water shortages are affecting more than 300 million people in the country, the Indian government said recently, turning the spotlight on a problem that has frequently plagued the South Asian nation in recent years.
There are various ways in which a drought can be defined. A meteorological drought is when there is a shortfall of rains. A hydrological drought occurs when deficient rainfall leads to plummeting water reserves. And agricultural drought is declared when the lack of water affects crops and harvests.
India relies heavily on seasonal monsoon rains for rainfall and water. And as a result of poor monsoons over the past two years as well as weak rainfall in the early months of this year, reservoirs, ponds and wells have dried up in many parts of the vast nation, causing acute water shortages.
The situation has forced authorities in some Indian states to ration drinking water and use trains to transport fresh water to certain drought-ravaged areas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"However WaterAid India's Head of Policy, Nitya Jacob, says groundwater levels are so depleted that even if a good monsoon comes in June -- and meteorologists predict there will be one that ends the drought -- it won't be enough.
""Even if the monsoon is good, it cannot compensate,"" Jacob told CNN.
Central Water Commission data shows that India's major reservoirs are 79% empty, and 75% of India's basins are holding less water than the 10-year average.
CNN Meteorologist, Michael Guy, says this is usually the hottest time for the subcontinent, but this year has seen abnormally high temperatures.
""India is currently in their summer or pre-monsoon season, which lasts from April to late May, or early June,"" says Guy.
""This year we've seen temperatures range from the lower 40s to as high as 47˚C or 116˚Fahrenheit. For some, this is three to five degrees (Celsius) above normal.""
And critically, the past two monsoon seasons have seen below average rainfall.
""This has had a huge impact on groundwater supplies,"" says Jacob.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"India is reeling under severe water crisis and rural distress as the country faced two consecutive deficient monsoon seasons in 2014 and 2015. But the worst is yet to come as more frequent drought monsoons are expected to come India’s way between 2020 and 2049, according to a scientific paper to be published in Current Science. The paper was first reported by The Indian Express.
The study refers to past rainfall records to understand why this is likely to happen.
After India began taking rainfall measurements since the 1840s, it was observed that the country has three-decade-long periods or epochs of alternating dry and wet monsoons. For example, during the dry epoch 1960-89, there were 10 monsoon drought years, but during 1930-59, India had only two drought monsoons. And so the cycle has been observed from 1840 to 1989.
Met experts found this alternating nature of dry and wet tri-decadal phases to be associated with the cold phase of the Atlantic multi-decadal oscillation in sea surface temperature. Curiously, the 1990-2019 epoch was expected to be a wet one, going by the cycle of the ocean-atmosphere system of the earlier 150-year period. 2014 and 2015 were part of a three decade period, 1990-2019, which was supposed to have more good monsoons and very few bad monsoons. But while 1990 to 2000 saw no drought monsoons, the following two decades have seen five drought monsoons so far (2002, 2004, 2009, 2014 and 2015).
“...the frequent drought scenario has reappeared after the first decade of the expected wet epoch. The cooling trend of the Asian upper troposphere over Central Asia is believed to have caused this,"" explains the paper authored by researchers from Kochi-based Nansen Environmental Research Centre India and Pune-based Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"When a nation of 1.25 billion falls into a prolonged drought, it doesn't take long for the reservoirs to nearly run dry.
That's especially true when the monsoons arrive late, as they've done this year in India. More than 300 million of the country's residents have been directly affected by the drought, and poor yields have driven an average of nine farmers to suicide each day, according to the New York Times.
It's a very ugly situation that won't get better until the rains arrive, and even then, they'll need a lot of it to pull out of this drought.
The animated image at the top of this page shows one of India's reservoirs that has been hit especially hard by the drought – Jharkhand state's Panchet Hill reservoir. Located in far eastern India, Panchet Hill stood at just 4 percent of capacity at the beginning of this month. The first frame in the image – the one that shows the reservoir considerably more full – was taken a year ago, while the second frame shows just how far the water level has fallen in 2016.
According to NASA's Earth Observatory, June water levels at Panchet Hill are about 40 percent of capacity during a normal year, but are replenished by the monsoon rains soon after. This year, with the reservoir at just 4 percent of capacity, it'll take a lot more rain than usual to refill the reservoir, whenever the rain arrives.
The images, acquired by NASA's Operational Land Imager on the Landsat 8 satellite, show one example of a countrywide problem. India's 91 major reservoirs were a combined 16 percent of capacity as of June 9, down 79 percent from the 10-year average, NASA said. Last week, officials said the city of Mumbai only had about 25 days' worth of water left in its reservoirs, the Times of India reported, further highlighting how dire this situation has become – even in the big cities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She balances two metal pots of muddy water atop her head, and carries a third in the crook of her arm - the only water she and her family of five will have for the day's needs of drinking, cooking and washing.
Babulkar's village of Shahapur, in Thane district of the west Indian state of Maharashtra, is in the grips of one of the worst droughts in decades. Parched fields, burnt crops and wasted cattle have helped drive up the number of suicides by distressed farmers unable to repay their loans. Tens of thousands have left their farms in search of menial jobs, with many joining the ranks of the unemployed poor in the cities.
The vast Indian hinterland has long faced water shortages, especially in the torrid months from April to June, before the annual monsoon rains bring some relief. The showers, which normally run from June to September, are crucial in a country where 60 per cent of the 1.25 billion population works in agriculture and less than half the farmland is irrigated. But decades of groundwater abuse, flawed water policies and poor monsoons have turned large parts of central India into an arid dust bowl.
Hundreds of millions of people in at least 13 states are reeling from severe drought, a situation that is expected to worsen in the coming months. Last month, a power plant was shut down for 10 days in West Bengal after running out of water to cool the coal-fired plant's heating pipes. Sizzling temperatures touching nearly 43 degree Celsius this week have led to more than 130 heat-related deaths in Orissa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana states.
But nowhere is the situation as extreme as in Maharashtra.
On Wednesday, a Mumbai court demanded 13 Indian Premier League cricket matches be moved to locations other than Maharashtra because maintaining the cricket grounds would require millions of gallons of water.
Environmental activist Darryl D'Monte said Maharashtra's water crisis had been exacerbated by a recent agricultural shift from growing crops of millet, sorghum and other cereals to growing water-guzzling sugarcane.
""It's time we took a longer view and stop the wastage of water with sugarcane,"" he said, accusing big sugarcane interests and politicians of ignoring the region's naturally dry climate in pursuit of profits from the lucrative crop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"Government plans to link Bhima and Manjara rivers in Maharashtra to tackle water crisis situation in drought-hit Marathwada region of the state in the long-run, Rajya Sabha was informed today.
Union Minister of State for Water Resources Sanwar Lal Jat said this in response to queries on the action the Centre is taking to figure long-term solutions for water shortage in Marathwada and Bundelkhand regions.
“The long-term measures in Marathawada, inter alia, include interlinking of Bhima and Manjara rivers,” he said.
Jat said, as part of the government’s efforts, the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) has prioritised Bundelkhand and parts of Marathwada for aquifer mapping and management program “in order to delineate aquifer disposition and their charecterisation along with quantification and for preparation of aquifer/area specific ground water management plans”.
The minister also said the CGWB had in 2013 prepared a conceptual document titled ‘Master Plan for Artificial Recharge to Ground Water in India’ which envisages construction of different types of artificial recharge and rainwater harvesting structures in the country including the two drought-hit regions.
Jat said, the government has deputed technical teams comprising officers of Central Water Commission (CWC) and CGWB for on the spot study of water situation and interaction with the state governments.
Asked whether water level in the two regions have plunged to 500 ft below ground-level, Jat differed, saying the deepest ground water level recorded in Marathwada region is 45.62 m (140 ft), while that in Bundelkhand is 49.4 m – both according to a January 2016 assessment.
Responding to another question, he said four major dams monitored by CWC, namely Jayakwadi, Bhima, Yeldari and Girna, have reported zero water stock level as per the latest bulletin for week ending on April 21.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"India is facing one of its most serious droughts in recent memory – official estimates suggest that at least 330m people are likely to be affected by acute shortages of water. As the subcontinent awaits the imminent arrival of the monsoon rains, bringing relief to those who have suffered the long, dry and exceptionally warm summer, the crisis affecting India’s water resources is high on the public agenda.
Unprecedented drought demands unconventional responses, and there have been some fairly unusual attempts to address this year’s shortage. Perhaps most dramatic was the deployment of railway wagons to transport 500,000 litres of water per day across the Deccan plateau, with the train traversing more than 300km to provide relief to the district of Latur in Maharashtra state.
The need to shift water on this scale sheds light on the key issue that makes water planning in the Indian subcontinent so challenging. While the region gets considerable precipitation most years from the annual monsoon, the rain tends to fall in particular places – and for only a short period of time (about three months). This water needs to be stored, and made to last for the entire year.
In most years, it also means that there is often too much water in some places, resulting in as much distress due to flooding as there currently is due to drought. So there is a spatial challenge as well – water from the surplus regions needs to reach those with a shortfall, and the water train deployed in Maharashtra is one attempt to achieve this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"Ethiopia is in the grip of its worst drought in recent history. More than ten million people are in need of assistance according to the Government and humanitarian agencies.

Humanitarian needs in Ethiopia have tripled since early 2015 as severe drought in some regions, exacerbated by the strongest El Nino in decades, caused successive harvest failures and widespread livestock deaths.
Acute malnutrition has risen sharply, and one quarter of Ethiopia’s districts are now officially classified as facing a nutrition crisis.

drought,,"he Obama administration is sending disaster response teams to northern Ethiopia to try to address a humanitarian emergency and avoid a national security risk to the U.S. should the drought there spiral out of control.
Experts are predicting northern Ethiopia will experience the worst drought in generations, one that will surpass the 1984 famine that killed one million men, women and children and galvanized stars like Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder and Bruce Springsteen to record the 1985 charity song ""We are the World.""
The Ethiopian government -- a major partner in U.S. counterterrorism efforts -- estimates that 10.2 million people will need food assistance, on top of about 8 million people who are chronically food insecure, and up to 2 million people will need safe drinking water. The United Nations estimates that as many as 15 million Ethiopians could suffer acute malnutrition or worse unless more help is found.
""We are acting to prevent a major humanitarian crisis and protect Ethiopia's hard-earned development progress,"" Gayle Smith, administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, said Thursday In announcing the deployment of a Disaster Assistance Response Team.
She also called on additional countries to pitch in.
""Other donors must also step-up their responses now,"" she said.
Intervening isn't just a moral issue but also a matter of national security, U.S. officials said.
""Climate-related threats pose an urgent and growing threat to our national security, contributing to increased natural disasters, refugee flows and potential conflicts over basic resources like food and water,"" said USAID spokesman Ben Edwards.
The U.S. is concerned that conditions could lead to instability, that a situation where there's a lack of food and jobs could encourage young people to join extremist groups while refugees flows destabilize population centers.
Ethiopia works with the U.S. on threats in the Horn of Africa, a conflict-ridden area plagued by the terrorism of al-Shabaab, among other groups. The area encompasses Sudan, Somalia and Djibouti -- home to the U.S. naval expeditionary base Camp Lemonnier -- as well as Sudan, Kenya and Ethiopia. Events in the region often impact Yemen, Libya and Egypt.
In January, a bipartisan group of lawmakers visited the Ethiopian capital to express support for the country's help on regional threats.
Rep. Ed Royce, the California Republican who heads the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said that thanks to Ethiopia's ""efforts to confront extremism, al-Shabaab has not expanded footholds in the Horn of Africa"" and commended its contributions to peacekeeping missions.
Smith, of USAID, said the administration will send an elite team of nearly 20 disaster experts to provide technical assistance, conduct humanitarian assessments and coordinate relief efforts with partners on the ground. She also said that the U.S. would provide nearly $4 million in maize and wheat seed for more than 226,000 households.
Ethiopia has made strides in creating greater food stability, according to the U.N., but its ability to predict the severity of this drought, after unreliable rainy seasons in the north, was complicated by an ocean-warming El Niño that scientists say is altering weather worldwide, bringing drought to California and unseasonably warm days in New York.
While international assistance is arriving, Ethiopia is also competing for aid with human disasters unfolding in war-ravaged Syria and Yemen and a refugee crisis in Europe, all of which are contributing to donor fatigue, experts say.
The new U.S. funds announced by Smith today add to more than $532 million in humanitarian assistance to Ethiopia since October 2014 for emergency food assistance, safe drinking water and nutrition and health support. Some of that money went to better prepare Ethiopia and other Horn countries for natural calamities like these that are almost predictable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here in the Ingal mountains that straddle the border with Eritrea, the effects of Ethiopia’s worst drought in more than 30 years are written into the landscape.
The failure of both of the main rainy seasons last year had a devastating effect on an area where virtually every family lives off the land.
It has left almost every household dependent on food parcels from the Ethiopian government and, by prompting many young men to conclude they must leave, it has caused a surge in the number attempting long and dangerous journeys, primarily to Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Europe, in search of work.
Of 962 households in the village of Agere Lokema, 40km from Adigrat, 286 are headed by women.
“We women would migrate as well if we thought we could find work,” says Abeba Teklehaymanot, whose husband’s departure for the Middle East left her looking after their children and half hectare of land.
At night, when the children sleep and the temperature dips, Teklehaymanot joins teams of locals working to irrigate land – part of a project, co-run by Trócaire, aimed at diverting water for use by the community.
Further down the valley, the work is beginning to bear fruit: a series of stone and wire-mesh dams has trapped water and increased soil fertility, allowing livestock to feed and landless families to plant crops.
Recalling a sequence that began with the failure of the harvest and the gradual depletion of families’ food reserves, Teklehaymanot says it was the elderly who first felt the effects of the drought. Then she noticed the animals weaken.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to the latest reports by the World Food Programme, some 10 million people are affected by the Horn of Africa's worst drought in 60 years.
Two consecutive rainy seasons have failed, producing a decline of more than 25% of rain for pastoral areas in Somalia, Northern and Eastern Kenya, Southern and Eastern Ethiopia and Djibouti. As a result harvests have failed, livestock mortality has soared, and food and water have become extremely expensive.
The price of food for essential cereals like maize has increased 2,5 times in Eastern Kenya, Eastern Ethiopia and Southern Somalia. Millions of people in the region cannot meet basic survival needs, and emergency levels of acute malnutrition are widespread.
In most areas affected by the drought, malnutrition is affecting over 30% of people, which is more than double the internationally recognized emergency threshold. Those who can are leaving their land and their homes to walk long distances trying to find food and water. Many Somalis are crossing borders to do that. An estimated 3,000 people a day are arriving in Kenya and Ethiopia from Somalia in search for a help.
The crisis is expected to worsen over the coming three to four months. ""If we don't act now, famine will spread to all eight regions of southern Somalia within two months, due to poor harvests and infectious disease outbreaks,"" told Mark Bowden, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Somalia. 
Recovery is not expected until next year, given the expected late and below-average harvests, the depletion of pasture and water and the high prices of food, water, and fuel.

""We have avoided a major catastrophe because of major accomplishments that Ethiopia has been able to do,"" said Choice Okoro, the head of the Strategic Communications Unit for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Ethiopia. ""These national systems are behind Ethiopia's success -- these are the backbones of the response of the current drought,"" Okoro said, crediting government programs for the free flow of international aid.
The drought has affected most of the country, imperiling crops in six of the country's eight administrative regions, in addition to other countries such as Zimbabwe, South Africa, Sudan and South Sudan, and some parts of Kenya and Uganda.
The Catholic church is deeply involved with drought relief in Ethiopia and across Africa, although Catholics make up less than 1 percent of Ethiopia's population.

The cost of providing immediate drought relief, they said, is $1.2 billion, revised to $1.4 billion in May.

Hadwen leads the Canadian Drought Monitor, Agriculture Canada's contribution to a continent wide tracking program of drought conditions.
Right now, his program is watching Nova Scotia's struggles carefully. It's one of three provinces experiencing a drought, the others are Ontario and British Columbia, he said.
""Typically in the prairie region, farmers and residents in rural areas are used to dealing with these circumstances, so they prepare for it,"" Hadwen said.
""In situations where we have drought in Atlantic Canada, there aren't the same systems in place and people aren't as familiar with managing through drought situations, so the impacts can be fairly severe.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"International charities have issued a stark warning about a looming humanitarian catastrophe in Ethiopia. The North African country has been hit by its worst drought for 50 years. It is widely expected that emergency food aid for 10 million Ethiopians will run out unless more funds can be found. John Graham, the head of the charity Save the Children in Ethiopia, said: ""The international community has just three weeks to provide $245 million in emergency food aid to help prevent a potentially catastrophic escalation in severe malnutrition cases."" He added that: ""If these emergency funds do not arrive in time, there is no question that there will be a critical fracture in the food aid supply pipeline.""
Ethiopia is Africa’s second most populous country. It is no stranger to natural disasters of this kind. Famine killed over one million Ethiopians in 1984. The latest drought was brought on by the El Nino weather phenomenon, which has caused drought and flooding across much of Africa. Ethiopia is one of the countries hardest hit. Charities say that over 400,000 Ethiopian children under the age of five will suffer from severe malnutrition this year. In addition, 1.7 million under-fives, pregnant women and breast-feeding mothers will need treatment for malnutrition. Mr Graham warned that, ""the window for action is rapidly closing"" as it can take four months to buy food aid and transport it into the landlocked country.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"Some 400 delegates from across Africa and beyond have come together in Windhoek, Namibia for the first African Drought Conference. International and African leaders and experts are set to find solutions to the recurring drought events and their associated impacts.
The principal objective of the conference is for African countries to come up with an overarching strategic framework for Africa that will enhance drought resilience  and promote a paradigm shift from ‘reactive’ to ‘proactive’ drought management. 
The conference is organized by the Namibian Ministry of Environment and Tourism supported by UNCCD in partnership with a number of international organizations and countries. 
The conference which is taking place from August 15 – 19 is split between technical segment (15 – 17 August) and a high level segment (18-19 August).
The African Drought Conference was launched under the chairmanship of Minister Pohamba and with the presence of Namibian deputy Prime Minister and Minister in charge of international cooperation, the minister of Agriculture, the AUC commissioner for rural economy and agriculture, the UN resident coordinator and other officials. Many African countries, IO, CSOs, etc. Mr. Daniel Tsegai is delivering a speech on behalf of UNCCD Secretariat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"Food shortage fears over a drought in southern Africa have prompted Malawi to declare a state of national disaster and Mozambique to issue a ""red alert"".
The President of Malawi, Peter Mutharika, warned in a statement some people needed aid for all of this year.
Mozambique raised alert levels for southern and central regions.
Zimbabwe, Lesotho and Zambia are also suffering food shortages, while South Africa says its drought is the worst in a century.
Over 10 million people across the region will need food aid in the coming year, according to the World Food Programme (WFP).
Malawi has suffered both flash floods and drought recently, hitting the staple maize crop.
""It is very clear that we have a food shortage in the country which will affect a considerable number of our fellow citizens,"" Mr Mutharika said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"""Delivering the right response for the millions affected across this region is an important test of our ability to collaborate across borders, institutional and sectoral boundaries"", says Deputy Humanitarian Chief.
The impact of the current El Niño is felt globally, affecting over 60 million people. Southern Africa is of particular concern as the region is facing its worst drought in 35 years, with an estimated 40 million people facing food insecurity, including some 23 million in need of urgent humanitarian assistance. 
Five countries – Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe – have already declared national emergencies, in addition to eight out of nine provinces in South Africa that collectively account for 90 per cent of the country’s maize production. Mozambique has also issued an institutional red alert for its most affected central and southern provinces. While the current diminished harvest provides some temporary respite, the lean season will start earlier than normal and food insecurity is expected to peak between October 2016 and March 2017. The time is now to scale-up the humanitarian response and preserve development gains.
In addition, there is a high probability of La Niña phenomenon toward the end of this year, which is likely to exacerbate the humanitarian situation, as coping capacity has been eroded. Contingency plans need to incorporate the possibility of localized flooding, and due to the reduced capacity of vulnerable farmers to access inputs, there is a need for interventions now that enable people to capitalize on potentially good rains. The aggregated scale of need in the region is on a par with the drought in Ethiopia and there needs to be a commensurate response from international donors in support of the Southern Africa region.
Co-hosted by DFID and OCHA, the focus of this conference was to raise the profile of the impacts of El Niño and La Niña in Southern Africa, to better understand the severe impacts of the crisis at local, national and regional levels, and discuss how donors and partners can come together to provide a coordinated and rapid response. DFID has already responded by scaling up response in countries where they have a presence. UN agencies and partners have also geared up to increase response and promote the visibility of the crisis. This has included the appointment of two special envoys on El Niño and Climate, Ms. Mary Robinson and Ambassador Macharia Kamau. However, more needs to be done and we have a narrowing window of opportunity to reduce mortality, alleviate suffering and enable early recovery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"The High-Level Meeting of the inaugural African Drought Conference, comprising African member States and Parties to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), adopted an overarching Strategic Framework to enhance resilience to the impact of drought events in Africa, issued the ‘The Windhoek Declaration,’ and underscored the importance of drought resilience in achieving Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The Drought Conference took place from 15-19 August 2016 in Windhoek, Namibia, following the conclusion of the 3rd Africa Drylands Week. It was hosted by the Government of Namibia, with support from the UNCCD, the African Union (AU) and diverse partners. The Conference was one of the main outcomes of the Namibia Declaration adopted at the 11th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 11) to the UNCCD, which emphasized a stronger UNCCD to achieve the SDG target 15:3 on land degradation neutrality through an increased focus on mitigating the impacts of droughts and the development of national drought policies.
The High-Level Meeting issued ‘The Windhoek Declaration for Enhancing Resilience to Drought in Africa,’ which calls for operationalization of the Strategic Framework for Drought Risk Management and Enhancing Resilience in Africa, and the implementation of ‘Drought Resilient and Prepared Africa’ (DRAPA) programmes at the national level. It requests African Union Heads of State and Government to “adopt a decision under the framework of the UNCCD” to develop a binding protocol on Drought Risk Management for Enhancing Resilience to be submitted for consideration to the UNCCD COP 13 in 2017.
The Windhoek Declaration also notes the need for all African countries and partners to ensure that the implementation of the Strategic Framework is considered as part of national SDG implementation frameworks and to enhance synergies among the existing international agreements and other Conventions particularly among the three Rio Conventions, namely the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), UNCCD and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
The Strategic Framework was finalized during the technical segment of the Drought Conference, which also considered, among other issues: African perspectives on drought, land degradation and desertification; linkages to the SDGs and the African Union’s Agenda 2063; outcomes of the 3rd Africa Drylands Week; best practices in drought management; national, regional and global drought monitoring and early warning systems; vulnerability assessments; innovative sources of finance for enhancing resilience to drought events; and appropriate response and relief measures during and after drought events.
Conference participants committed themselves to, inter alia: establish a continent-wide African Network with national institutions for Drought Monitoring and Early Warning Systems; convene a biennial African Drought Conference concurrently with the African Drylands Week to consider progress on implementation of the Strategy; facilitate timely drought information, vulnerability and impact assessment, and mitigation measures at the country, regional and continental levels; and systematically and strategically tap into existing financing opportunities, in particular climate change adaptation financing and other financing mechanisms including from the private sector.
The African Drought Conference was preceded by the 3rd Africa Drylands Week from 8-12 August 2016, which convened under the theme of ‘Promoting sustainable development in African drylands.’ Discussions brought together diverse stakeholders, including representatives of farmers, women and youth organizations, scientists, policy and decision makers, practitioners and development specialists, with a focus on the sub-themes of land tenure, migration, conflict and land valuation in drylands, and opportunities presented by the SDGs and the Paris Agreement on climate change.
The Week also sought to build the scientific basis for the implementation of African Drylands initiatives and to strengthen synergies in the implementation of the Great Green Wall for the Sahara and the Sahel Initiative (GGWSSI) and other flagship drought and resilience programmes. Participants called for the Africa Drylands Week to be institutionalized by the African Union Assembly, as a regular and sustained means of promoting development in drylands.
The Drylands Week was co-organized by the African Union Commission (AUC), the Government of Namibia, the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) Planning and Coordinating Agency, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), the Permanent Inter-States Committee on the Control of Drought in the Sahel (CILSS), and other international and regional partners, with support from the African Union (AU) and the European Union.
In the lead up to the Drylands Week and Drought Conference, publications released by the World Bank and UNCCD highlighted new data as well as innovative approaches to building drought resilience in Africa. The UNCCD study, titled ‘The ripple effect: A fresh approach to reducing drought impacts and building resilience,’ calls for proactive and “risk-based” approaches to tackling the impacts of droughts, floods and other extreme weather events in an integrated way. The publication presents new data on the interlinkages between drought and water scarcity, and notes that demand for water is estimated to grow by an estimated 55% by 2050, which could lead to a loss of up to 6% of the gross domestic product (GDP) of some regions. The publication highlights the impact of climate change on water scarcity and food price volatility, and explores how drought and falling land productivity impact migration and conflict.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"Meteorological drought events result from a prolonged deficiency of precipitation. If persistent, they can lead to decreased agricultural production, forest fires, inadequate public water supplies, reduced energy production, and even permanent land degradation and desertification. Their impacts are difficult to assess as they affect extended areas and can take months or even years to develop.
Recent damages caused by droughts in Europe were estimated at over €100 billion. Of the 21 major droughts that hit Europe from 1950 to 2012, six occurred after 2000. While water shortage has historically been common in southern European countries, almost the whole of Europe has been repeatedly affected by drought in the past 30 years, and especially in the past decade.
The objective of the report is to provide decision makers with comprehensive information on meteorological drought hotspots and trends for better managing drought challenges in the future. It describes the construction of the first ever database of European meteorological drought events that occurred from 1950 to 2012, classified by country and region according to their duration, severity, intensity, peak and area involved. It also develops a dataset of drought impacts based on damage functions that correlate the severity of the drought events with the impacts, which it tested on two sectors: cereal production and hydropower generation.
Global warming will be a key factor regarding the more extreme impacts of drought in Europe, particularly in the last decades of the 21st century. Future drought events are likely to be more frequent, longer, and more severe and intense in most of southern Europe, while increased precipitation in northern Europe is likely to lead to a reduction in the frequency, duration, severity and intensity of drought events. Results suggest that cereal yields and hydropower production are likely to be more often and more severely impacted in southern Europe, and less frequently and severely in northern Europe.
The new database of past European drought events can be used as the basis for studying their impacts in different sectors and to project the potential impacts of future events.  It is planned to apply the new methodologies to drought trends on a seasonal basis, different climate scenarios and other sectors of the economy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"Droughts in California are mainly controlled by wind, not by the amount of evaporated moisture in the air, new research has found.
The findings were published in Geophysical Research Letters, a journal of the American Geophysical Union, on June 30. The research increases the understanding of how the water cycle is related to extreme events and could eventually help in predicting droughts and floods, said lead author Jiangfeng Wei, a research scientist at The University of Texas at Austin’s Jackson School of Geosciences.
“Ocean evaporation provides moisture for California precipitation but is not the reason for droughts there, although the ocean evaporation is slightly lower during droughts,” Wei said.
The researchers analyzed 30-year data sets that recorded precipitation, ocean evaporation, surface wind speed and atmospheric pressure on and near the west coast of the United States. These are all factors that influence the water cycle in California. One of the difficulties of studying the water cycle, Wei said, is that the water sources for precipitation cannot be directly observed, so the team also used a mathematical moisture-tracking method and high-resolution model simulations.
Their analysis showed that although moisture evaporated from the Pacific Ocean is the major source for California precipitation, the amount of water evaporated did not strongly influence precipitation in California, except in the cases of very heavy flooding. That’s because the amount of water evaporated from this ocean region does not change much year by year, researchers found, and did not cause rain to occur more or less often.
“Ocean evaporation has little direct influence on California precipitation because of its relatively weak variability,” Wei said.
Instead, the researchers found that disturbances in atmospheric circulation, the large-scale movement of air, have the most effect on drought because they can affect factors that will cause it to rain more or less.
The study co-authors are Qinjian Jin, a postdoctoral researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who earned his Ph.D. at the Jackson School; Zong-Liang Yang, a professor in the Jackson School’s Department of Geological Sciences; and Paul Dirmeyer, a professor at George Mason University.
Most of California has been in a severe drought since 2011, although a strong El Niño in the winter of 2015 helped diminish the drought. The current drought is caused by a high-pressure system that disturbs the atmospheric circulation. The development of the high-pressure system is related to a sea surface temperature pattern in the Pacific Ocean, according to research cited by the study.
“Although this is a very rare event, the probability of this kind of high-pressure system is likely increasing with global warming,” the authors said.
Yang said that the research could aid in the prediction of droughts and floods by improving scientific understanding of the intricate factors that influence rainfall the most.
“The topic is extremely timely as current and future climate change would mean more changes in extreme events such as droughts and floods,” Yang said. “Understanding this asymmetric contribution of ocean evaporation to drought and flooding in California will ultimately help us make better predictions.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"El Nino-induced drought has left Africa dry and hungry. It is now compelling authorities of the Kruger National Park to kill about 350 hippos and buffaloes. Severe drought in southern Africa, dubbed as the worst in 35 years, has pushed the animals in South Africa’s biggest wildlife park to extreme level of suffering.
According to a spokesperson for South African National Parks, the protracted dry spell had caused a shortage of food for the animals. The carrying capacity of the national park has gone far below than what it accommodates: 8,000 hippos and 47,000 buffaloes.
According to one of the spokespersons of the Park, these two species consume large amount of vegetation and most of them are expected to die anyway because of the drought. Water scarcity during drought makes hippos more vulnerable to poaching as they come and gather in ponds.
When millions of people are facing food crisis in neighbouring countries and water restrictions have been imposed back home, the authorities look to take pressure off the land by culling the animals with the objective of preventing animals from suffering.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"Nestle extracted 36 million gallons of water from a national forest in California last year to sell as bottled water, even as Californians were ordered to cut their water use because of a historic drought in the state.
And the permit that Nestle uses to operate its water pipeline in the San Bernardino national forest costs just $524 (£357) a year.
That rankles with some residents and environmental groups, who want the US government to cut off Nestle's access to the water until an environmental study can be conducted.
Nestle has the legal rights to the water, and Arrowhead water has been bottled from springs here since 1894.
Yet the firm's permit to operate this seven-mile pipeline in the mountains expired in 1988, though since it pays its yearly $524, the licence is still considered valid by the US Forest Service and by Nestle.
However, activists consider the permit expired and the US government is now reviewing Nestle's licence. A public comment period has just closed and this month a federal hearing will consider the legality of the permit.
""The forest service should protect the forest,"" says Amanda Frye, a resident who's becoming known as a water rights activist. ""A healthy forest produces a healthy population of people. We need the forest.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"Remember the California drought? It was all over the news a year ago, when the state took the unprecedented step of mandating statewide water cutbacks. The Sierra Nevada snowpack was at its lowest recorded level. Rivers and reservoirs were getting shallower and shallower. Wells in rural towns were literally running dry.
That drought is still very much a thing.
More than 62 percent of California remains in severe to exceptional drought conditions, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. And without a wet winter the state could be facing a sixth-consecutive year of severe drought.
""Absolutely we're still in a drought,"" says Peter Gleick, a co-founder of the Pacific Institute, a water think tank. ""We are way below normal. Our reservoirs are low. Our groundwater is still being grossly over-pumped.""
Problem is: People aren't acting like it — at least not quite like they did. And that's raising questions about how the drought is being messaged.
A year ago, when Governor Jerry Brown mandated a 25 percent water cutback, the message was dire and it was clear. Californians rose to the occasion. In August 2015, urban water consumption was cut by 27 percent statewide, compared to the same month in 2013.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"The unprecedented drought that has gripped the Southwest United States has severely depleted the Sierra Nevada snowpack, the major source of water for drinking and farming in California. Researchers and water managers thought this past winter’s monster El Niño would bring enough rainfall to help ease the strain on water resources, but whether El Niño rains were enough to replenish the dwindling snowpack remained to be seen.
Here Margulis et al. calculated daily estimates of this winter’s snowpack volume in the Sierra Nevada using data from Landsat satellites and snow survey data collected by California’s Department of Water Resources. The team also used the satellite images and historical measurements of the snowpack and of past El Niños to estimate the snowpack’s total volume for each year from 1951 to 2015.
The researchers found that this winter’s strong El Niño did not bring enough rain to replenish the snowpack’s depleted stores. In 2015, the water volume of the snowpack was just 2.9 cubic kilometers (0.7 cubic mile), whereas a typical year is about 18.6 cubic kilometers (4.46 cubic miles), according to the study. Accounting for the 4-year snowpack deficit from the 2012–2015 drought, the researchers conclude it will likely take until 2019 for the snowpack to return to predrought levels, even if there are above-average precipitation years.
The team suggest that their method, which provides unprecedented detail and precision, could be useful in characterizing snowpack water in other mountain ranges, including the Andes and the Himalayas. These areas currently have much less on-site monitoring than in the Sierra Nevada.
The larger goal of the research is to build a detailed, continuous picture of the historical snowpack and diagnose the primary factors that cause it to vary. This information can ultimately improve models for predicting how much water will be available from the snowpack in the future, which will inform water management decisions.

drought,,"Governor Jerry Brown has ordered California to adopt permanent water conservation measures in response to a devastating five-year drought, including long-term bans on wasteful practices and mandatory reporting rules.
While the drought has become less severe in recent months – leading some communities and water agencies to abandon strict restrictions – Brown’s executive order on Monday made clear that the drought was not over and that California must transition its short-term emergency measures into a permanent conservation plan.
“Californians stepped up during this drought and saved more water than ever before,” Brown said in a statement. “But now we know that drought is becoming a regular occurrence and water conservation must be a part of our everyday life.”
Water officials on Monday also announced that the state is considering lifting a mandatory conservation order for cities and towns – an emergency rule adopted last year that requires at least 20% overall conservation by most water districts.
On 18 May, the state’s water resources control board will weigh a proposal to allow cities and water agencies to set their own conservation targets based on their projected shortages if the drought continues for three more years.
Under the new order from Brown, who adopted mandatory cuts for urban water use one year ago, California will “permanently prohibit wasteful practices, such as hosing off sidewalks, driveways and other hardscapes, washing automobiles with hoses not equipped with a shut-off nozzle, and watering lawns in a manner that causes runoff”, according to the governor’s office.
Urban water suppliers will also be required to permanently report data on water use, conservation and enforcement, and the state will develop new “water use efficiency targets” that go beyond a goal of 20% reduction by 2020 that officials originally adopted in 2009.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"As the fifth year of California’s drought grinds on much-needed rain will help lessen the economic damage on the agriculture industry, according to a new economic analysis released Monday.
“This year we still have a drought but it’s not nearly as bad as 2014 or 2015 for agriculture,” said Jay Lund, director of the UC Davis Center for Watershed Sciences and one of the authors of the analysis. “But the state isn’t out of the woods as a lack of rain in 2017 could put California back in bad shape.”
About 78,800 acres of farmland are projected to be idled this year due to the ongoing drought. That is a small number compared with the estimated 540,000 acres of fallowed land in 2015. Overall, the state’s agriculture industry represents around 9.3 million acres of irrigated crops.
“Almost all fallowed land due to drought is projected to be on the west side of the San Joaquin Basin, which relies heavily on water imports,” according to the UC Davis analysis. “No significant drought-related impacts are expected for livestock and dairies this year as this sector is more affected by market conditions than drought this year.”
The study predicts water shortages in 2016 will cost the ag industry a total of $550 million in direct costs and 1,815 in lost jobs. That compares with an estimated $1.8 billion in direct costs and 10,100 in jobs last year, the UC Davis researchers said.
When looking at the drought’s total impact, including from businesses supporting farming and the loss of household incomes, the ag region losses this year are forecast to top $600 million and 4,700 jobs statewide. Researchers put the total economic loss last year at roughly $2.7 billion and 21,000 jobs statewide.
“Water costs are coming down from the highs farmers paid a year ago,” said Lund.
Some farmers have seen water costs go up sharply, making growing certain crops unprofitable. During the drought, it hasn’t been unusual for farmers to see water costs of $1,000 per acre-foot and above — well above the cost of roughly $120 per acre-foot they were accustomed to before the drought. Higher-priced water has tended to go to permanent crops such as tree nuts, orchard fruits and wine grapes.
Researchers said surface water supply for crops was roughly 14 percent less than normal statewide. Groundwater was responsible for offsetting roughly 70 percent of the ag industry’s surface water deficit statewide, researchers said.
The analysts pointed out that there were substantial rains in the northern part of the state that required several reservoirs to spill water for flood control purposes. Areas south of California’s Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, where two of the state’s major riverways converge, have seen drier conditions.
The U.S. Drought Monitor released last Thursday showed 59 percent of California remains in severe drought conditions, down from about 88 percent at the start of the calendar year. About 21 percent of the state remains in exceptional drought, although that compares with nearly 45 percent at the start of the year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"California’s megadrought is stretching into its fifth year, and as the best hope for rain, El Niño, fizzles, the outlook is grim. While Northern California's winter precipitation approached normal, 60 percent of the state remains in a severe drought.
So a new discovery under the Central Valley has residents excited; researchers from Stanford mapped out a deep groundwater reservoir under the Valley that holds three times more water than previously thought. They recently published their results in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
“It's not often that you find a ‘water windfall,’ but we just did,"" study co-author Robert Jackson says in a press release. “There's far more fresh water and usable water than we expected.”
Ria Misra at Gizmodo reports that the researchers estimate the reservoir holds 2,700 cubic kilometers of water or approximately 713 trillion liquid gallons. That’s more than Lake Erie and Lake Ontario combined.
The researchers analyzed data from more than 360 oil and gas fields in an eight-county area. Previous studies were based on estimates of water down to 1,000 feet below the surface. But the new study examines the water volume down to about 3,000 feet.
Despite the depth, Jackson tells Misra that the water is still retrievable. But the big question now is whether people should actually go after it. Pumping for groundwater can cause big changes to an area. Extracting during the drought has already led to subsidence in the Central Valley, which is sinking several inches per year, according to Dale Kasler, Ryan Sabalow and Phillip Reese at The Sacramento Bee. One area near Corcoran sank 13 inches in eight months. The sinking soil threatens the elaborate system of canals, pipes and bridges that transport water through the valley.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"As it copes with a searing drought, California has taken drastic measures, including a mandate by Gov. Jerry Brown that city-dwellers cut their water use by 25 percent.
That move stands in stark contrast to one made by Gov. Rick Perry in 2011, when Texas was at the height of its arguably worst-ever drought: He asked Texans to pray for rain.
But as the state grows drier and its population booms, Texas might soon find itself having to make the same sort of hard decisions that have become so common in California, experts say.
“There are certain things that have happened in California that are on their way to Texas,” said Wes Strickland, a water lawyer at the law firm Jackson Walker LLP who practices in both states.
Chief among those is environmental litigation, and the restrictions that come along with it, he said.
In fundamental ways, the states are different when it comes to water supplies and geography, with California appearing the more vulnerable. While Texas water supplies are fragmented, California’s are interconnected, with massive water pipelines pulling water from the mountain-top snowpacks in the state’s northeast and sending it to the more arid farming communities in its center.
Yet the very things that have insulated Texas from wider disputes — a regional focus on water planning, with very distinct approaches to regulating river water and groundwater — could lead to internecine battles as supplies grow more precious.
Texas has seen a few such clashes: Environmentalists and farmers in the Guadalupe and Brazos river basins have gone to court to fight for water jeopardized by drought. And ratcheted-up efforts to move underground water to fast-growing cities have been met with anger in the rural areas from which the water originates, with some residents accusing deal-makers of a “water grab.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

“You know, I was a nurse for years and I've seen a lot of horrible things in the OR... but this is... this is something different. You know, this is horrible,” she said.
Residents of the Scanlon’s Ashland neighborhood told FOX25 thee has been more coyote activity this year than any year they can remember.
Wildlife experts say drought conditions sometimes force animals to seek water in new places.
In California, which has experienced a long and severe drought, this translated into an increase in coyote sightings in neighborhoods.
“Drought can certainly cause wildlife to be stressed and be looking for available water resources wherever they are,” David Mizejewski from the National Wildlife Federation said.
Massachusetts state officials, however, say the drought here is not the same as the drought on the west coast.
In fact, State Wildlife Biologist Trina Monuzzi tells FOX25 high coyote activity in summer is actually normal.
“The young are actually learning how to hunt,” she said. “What we do have is a lot more of the small mammals which are their main prey source -- especially this year.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"alifornia's prehistoric droughts used to last for centuries and even millennia, but new research suggests greenhouse gases might be setting the state up for conditions equally as dire.
Published late last week in the journal Scientific Reports, the study found natural variations in climate – caused by things like sun spots, a decrease in volcanic activity or a small alteration in the planet's orbit – have warmed the region for prolonged periods of time over the last 10,000 years. It's a process known as radiative forcing, and now, greenhouse gases have been added to the list.
""Radiative forcing in the past appears to have had catastrophic effects in extending droughts,"" Glen MacDonald, a UCLA professor who led the study, said in a news release. ""When you have arid periods that persist for 60 years, as we did in the 12th century, or for millennia, as we did from 6,000 to 1,000 B.C., that’s not really a 'drought.' That aridity is the new normal.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,2017-2018,"Folsom Lake, one of California's largest reservoirs, is crucial to providing water to the state's 40 million-plus residents.
But this year, relentless heat and dry conditions have evaporated the already below-average snowpack on the nearby Sierra Nevada Mountains that supply the reservoir, bringing the lake's water levels to previously unseen lows.
Speaking to ABC News' Zohreen Shah on what should be the lake's floor, Rich Preston-Lemay, the sector superintendent for Folsom Lake Park, said that under normal conditions, where they were standing would be 70 feet underwater.
""The water that we're on right now is used for a variety of things, from drinking water for some of the local municipalities [to] ... downstream on the American River for the fisheries habitat, and then for other water consumers downstream for farming, agricultural purposes,"" said Preston-Lemay, who's overseen the lake for nearly 20 years.
Worsening drought is currently affecting all of California, threatening cascading issues from farmers' yields to the state's hydroelectric power plants, which could then cause rolling blackouts statewide and wildfires that displace entire communities.
California Natural Resources Secretary Wade Crowfoot said the drought is caused by climate change, and that it's no longer a phenomenon they are solely trying to preempt.

drought,,"“People die because they are not prepared to face the impacts of the drought – because their livelihoods are not resilient enough,” Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Director-General José Graziano da Silva told an international seminar in Rome, Italy, recalling that more than 250,000 people perished from hunger in the 2011 drought in Somalia.
“Saving livelihoods means saving lives – this is what building resilience is all about,” he added, noting that for years, the focus has been responding to droughts when they happen, rushing to provide emergency assistance and to keep people alive.
While these emergency responses are important, investing in preparedness and resilience puts countries on a footing to act quickly before it is too late, meaning that farmers and rural communities are better positioned to cope with extreme weather when it does hit.
The need for a global drought re-boot is pressing. The many impacts of drought drive not only hunger and instability but cause economic losses up to $8 billion each annually.
As the planet's climate changes, severe dry-spells are becoming more and more frequent. Since the 1970s, the land area in the world affected by situations of drought has doubled.
The burden is especially high in developing countries, where agriculture remains an economic mainstay. Over 80 percent of damage and losses caused by drought are born by agriculture in the developing world, FAO studies have shown.
And Africa in particular has borne the brunt. Between 2005 and 2016, 84 droughts affected 34 different African nations.
At today's event, FAO and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) signed a memorandum of understanding to deepen their cooperation. They will cooperate in improving agro-meteorological data, tools and methods as well as enhancing access by small farmers to products and services to help them anticipate and proactively prepare for droughts.
“WMO provides guidance and scientific information to strengthen national services responsible for addressing drought risks to agriculture,” said WMO Secretary General Petteri Taalas. “We encourage countries to take early action against drought and to move towards a more proactive approach.”
International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD) President Gilbert F. Houngbo in his remarks emphasized the need break the cycle of crisis, disaster and relief, calling on the international community to be proactive and to think not just of today's emergencies, but also of how to prevent tomorrow's.
“This means investing in smallholder farmers to help them address productivity challenges, give them access to markets and finance and most importantly encourage climate-smart agriculture so that when the drought inevitably comes, they have the tools they need to survive and thrive,” said Mr. Houngbo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"You’re probably familiar with the recent 5-year drought in California. That’s likely due in part to the intense media attention it attracted. At the peak of the coverage, there were nearly 30 times more drought-focused newspaper stories written per month than during an earlier Golden State drought that lasted from 2007 to 2009.
During the latest drought, even before California Gov. Jerry Brown mandated a 25 percent reduction in urban water use statewide in 2015, residents of the San Francisco Bay Area were consuming less water than they had a few years earlier. “The question was, what was driving them to reduce their water use?” asked Nicole Sandkulla, the CEO and general manager of the Bay Area Water Supply and Conservation Agency, a consortium of 26 cities and water districts.
New research suggests that newspapers were, in fact, part of the answer. Media attention — and the public awareness and engagement that follows — is one way to get people to use less water.
Researchers suspected that spikes in media coverage could be driving the drops in water consumption Sandkulla and others were seeing. To find out, Kimberly Quesnel and Newsha Ajami of Stanford University studied a decade’s worth of water use data, from 2005 to 2015, from 20 of the water agencies that belong to the Bay Area Water Supply and Conservation Agency. (The agency helped fund the study.)
The scientists also counted the number of articles related to drought that nine national and regional newspapers ran during the same period. There was less drought-centered coverage during the earlier drought, perhaps as a result of news coverage focused on the economic recession and the 2008 presidential election. The more recent dry spell, however, captured statewide and even national attention: The number of drought-focused articles published every month rose precipitously starting in 2014. “Drought in California was interesting, and it was the news of the day,” says Ajami, the director of urban water policy at Stanford’s Water in the West program.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"California’s historic five-year drought is officially over, washed away with the relentlessly drenching rains, floods and snowstorms of this winter.
But just as tougher building codes and better emergency planning follow major earthquakes, the brutally dry years from 2012 to 2016 are already leaving a legacy, experts say, changing the way Californians use water for generations to come.
“There’s no question that we’ll be better prepared for the next drought because of the lessons learned in this one,” said Felicia Marcus, chairwoman of the State Water Resources Control Board in Sacramento. “This was the wake-up call of the century.”
The drought’s legacy includes landmark new laws aimed at limiting farmers from over-pumping groundwater; homeowners removing thousands of suburban lawns; voters approving billions in funding for new reservoirs; and vast expanses of forests dying off across the Sierra Nevada.
“Every drought has a lasting impact,” said Jeff Mount, a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California Water Center in San Francisco. “That probably goes all the way back to the Depression.”
The era of massive dam building in California began after the 1929-34 drought. Urban water conservation started in earnest during the 1976-77 drought. And the state’s brutal 1987-92 drought prompted water departments in the Bay Area and Southern California to connect their networks of pipes together, to build huge groundwater storage banks and new local reservoirs, and to develop a statewide system of buying and selling water.
As a result of those changes, Californians were better prepared to handle the most recent drought, which saw the driest four-year period of any time back to 1895, when modern records began. Although some farm communities with limited groundwater suffered severely, California’s overall economy grew during the drought, up 10 percent to $2.2 trillion from 2012 to 2015.
“We lost a third of our water supply,” said Jay Lund, director of the Center for Watershed Sciences at UC-Davis. “And the impact to the agricultural economy was a 2-3 percent loss and the urban economy had almost no economic impact. To me that’s remarkable.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"A series of potent winter storms that lashed Northern, and more recently Southern California, has erased the worst of the long-term drought that plagued the Golden State for three years.
For the first time in 36 months, the US Drought Monitor report issued Thursday does not show any part of California in deep red, which denotes its highest designation, ""Exceptional Drought.”
At its height, the Exceptional Drought area covered nearly 2/3 of the state and as recently as Christmas of 2016, approximately 20% of the state was still in the worst of the drought.
It's not just the worst drought areas that have improved. Now, 38% of California is completely clear of any dryness, according to the Drought Monitor, the most drought-free area since December of 2011.
While the record El Niño of 2015/16 failed to live up to expectations when it came to putting a dent in the mult-year drought, a series of moisture-rich storms fueled by ""atmospheric rivers"" so far this winter has done the job.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"Drought conditions worsened in several states over the past week from extreme heat and weeks with little rain, raising the prospect that grocery staples such as bread and beans could cost more as the region that produces those commodities is hardest hit.
Drought conditions have begun to stress corn, soybeans, wheat and livestock in some areas, according to the weekly U.S. Drought Monitor released Thursday by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
In an image on the U.S. Drought Monitor website, sections of the U.S. are pictured as red and dark red -- indicating extreme or exceptional drought. The website indicates that the Drought Monitor focuses on broad-scale conditions and that local conditions may vary.
Nearly 11 percent of the continental United States is in moderate drought or worse, said Richard Heim, a meteorologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in this week's drought summary. The report is compiled weekly using data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and NOAA.
""Much of Montana and parts of the Dakotas, Nebraska, and Kansas had no rain this week; some areas have been drier than normal for the last two to three months; and some drought indicators reflect dryness for the last 12 months,"" Heim wrote.
About half of the nation's spring wheat, 13 percent of winter wheat, 15 percent of corn and 14 percent of the soybeans are in drought, the report said.
Consumers could see the price of bread at the grocery counter rise, said Doug Goehring, agriculture commissioner for North Dakota, the nation's largest producer of spring wheat and second largest grower of winter wheat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"Just a few days ago, on January 26th, 2017, we saw something in the U.S. climate that we hadn’t seen since March 2011. Well, technically, we didn’t see something, I guess.
For the first time since March 2011, there was no D4, “exceptional drought,” anywhere in the United States, as analyzed by the U.S. Drought Monitor. The last vestige of D4—the most severe category in the monitoring system—disappeared from its southern California holdout, part of a larger pattern of substantial mid-January drought improvements in California.
With all that said, the bottom line is that the nation is in better shape drought-wise than it has been for most of this decade.
The recap
During late 2015, the West was in pretty dire straits. Drought enveloped most of the region, from border to border, Pacific to Rockies. Late 2015 wetness helped the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies, and by spring 2016, drought was almost eradicated there.
However, drought held through spring south of the San Francisco Bay, where summer presents almost zero chance of drought recovery. But things did improve in late fall, and the last month brought waves of rain and high-altitude snow that improved things even more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Repeated droughts around the world are destroying enough farm produce to feed 81 million people for a year and are four times more costly for economies than floods, the World Bank found in a new study. Beyond hindering food production, erratic rainfall patterns and longer droughts as the climate changes are causing a host of problems for cities, including businesses.

drought,,"This is what pastoralists have done for centuries, following the movements of their animals and the changing seasons. However, because of the drought's effects on the Horn of Africa, these nine families have had to move six times in the last six months. They continue to seek drinkable water for themselves and their animals, hoping they will be able to hold out for the soon-to-come rainy season.
Nine pastoralist families’ lives, their wealth (their animals), and even their homes are all being transported towards a new site – where they hope they will be able to hold out for the soon-to-come rainy season.
The region was hit by an 18-month drought caused by El Niño and higher temperatures linked to climate change. Now, in the midst of even more drought, the situation has become catastrophic, causing crops to fail and cattle to die. In addition, the lack of clean water increases the threat of cholera and other diseases.
Across Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, and the autonomous region of Somaliland, 10.7 million people are facing severe hunger. There are increasing concerns that the situation will get much worse, as rainfall in March and early April was very low in places. Poor rainfall is forecast for April through June, the end of the rainy season.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"Many parts of the Greater Horn of Africa are expected to receive below average rainfall in the important March to May rainy season, worsening food security and water availability in countries already seriously hit by drought, according to a new seasonal outlook issued by the Greater Horn of Africa Climate Outlook Forum.
“What makes the current drought alarming in the Equatorial Greater Horn of Africa region is that it follows two consecutive poor rainfall seasons in 2016, and the likelihood of depressed rainfall persisting into the March-May 2017 rainfall season remains high,” said the Intergovernmental Authority on Development’s Climate Prediction and Applications Center (ICPAC), which convened the regional forum.
“The situation will be worse in countries already experiencing drought, including Somalia, Kenya, Ethiopia, parts of Uganda, South Sudan and parts of Tanzania. Many parts of the region will experience serious water stress,” it said.
With the exception of Sudan and Rwanda, the October - December 2016 rains failed in most countries in region. Contributing factors include the weak La Niña, which has just ended, and reduced moisture influx due to the cooling of the ocean water in the east African coast.
March to May is the main cropping season for many parts of the Greater Horn of Africa. The seasonal outlook is therefore of great importance to inform decision-making in climate sensitive sectors. The forum, attended by meteorological and climate experts and users from agriculture and food security, livestock, water resources, disaster risk management, Non- Governmental Organizations and development partner, took place in Addis Ababa from 6 to 7 February 2017.
The World Meteorological Organization supports regional climate outlook forums, which combine forecasting products from a variety of different models into a single consensus outlook. National meteorological services then downscale the regional outlook into national and local forecasts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"Drought throughout East Africa has sharply curbed harvests and pushed the prices of cereals and other staple foods to unusually high levels, posing a heavy burden to households and special risks for pastoralists in the region.
Local prices of maize, sorghum and other cereals are near or at record levels in swathes of Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania, according to the latest Food Price Monitoring and Analysis Bulletin (FPMA).
Inadequate rainfall in most areas of the sub-region has put enormous strain on livestock and their keepers. Poor livestock body conditions due to pasture and water shortages and forcible culls mean animals command lower prices, leaving pastoralists with even less income to purchase basic foodstuffs.
""Sharply increasing prices are severely constraining food access for large numbers of households with alarming consequences in terms of food insecurity,"" said Mario Zappacosta, FAO senior economist and coordinator of the Global Information and Early Warning System.
The trends in East Africa, where prices of staple cereals have doubled in some town markets, stand in marked contrast to the stable trend of FAO's Food Price Index, which measures the monthly change in international prices of a basket of traded food commodities.
The difference is due to the drought that is hammering the sub-region, where food stocks were already depleted by the strong El Niño weather event that ended only last year. Poor and erratic rainfall in recent months, crucial for local growing seasons, are denting farm output.
Somalia's maize and sorghum harvests are estimated to be 75 percent down from their usual level, and some 6.2 million people, more than half of the country's total population, now face acute food insecurity, with the majority of those most affected living in rural areas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"The scene is now common throughout eastern and southern Africa, as droughts for three consecutive years have decimated crops and caused widespread hunger. New research indicates that it is partly due to climate change driven by human action, which has worsened the El Niño weather phenomenon.
“This is about as bad as it has ever been,” said Chris Harvey, as he walked to his farm´s irrigation dam, where the water level has fallen six metres in 10 months.
“We might not be able to grow any vegetables next year,” his wife Sue added.
Dams in the area are drying out, symptomatic of the continent´s battle with years of poor rainfall. The droughts in eastern and southern Africa beginning in 2015 have affected tens of millions of people. The latest numbers from the UN suggest that 24 million people are facing food insecurity in eastern Africa alone, not counting millions of people in the southern region.
According to a new study published by the American Meteorological Society, such conditions will become increasingly normal as climate change takes its toll.
“We are advising governments to expect yearly disasters, droughts, floods, and also now diseases,” David Phiri, the UN´s food and agriculture coordinator in Southern Africa, told IRIN.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"Nearly 25 percent of the world’s malnourished population lives in sub-Saharan Africa, where more than 300 million people depend on corn, or maize, as their main food source. Maize is the most widely harvested agricultural product in Africa and is grown by small farmers who rely heavily on rainwater rather than irrigation. The crop is therefore extremely sensitive to drought, and since 2015 its production has fallen dramatically as a result of record-setting drought conditions across southern and eastern Africa. 
Now MIT scientists have found that climate change will likely further worsen drought conditions in parts of the continent, dramatically reshaping the production of maize throughout sub-Saharan Africa as global temperatures rise over the next century.
In a paper published online this week in the journal Earth’s Future, the researchers report that, if the world’s average temperatures rise by 4 degrees Celsius by the year 2100, much of southern Africa and the Sahel region just south of the Sahara desert — regions that contribute a significant portion of Africa’s maize production — will experience increased aridity, which in turn is predicted to decrease maize crop yields in some nations by over 20 percent.
“[Maize] is a relatively drought-sensitive crop in a region where agricultural production is mostly rainfed,” says lead author Amy Dale, a postdoc in MIT’s Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS). “If under climate change we have changes in temperature and precipitation, this is arguably one of the worst areas of the world where we’re going to see really negative impacts on crop production and malnourished populations.”
The researchers’ analysis also shows that climate change’s impact is less certain for the most arid regions of sub-Saharan Africa including the semiarid regions that produce over 40 percent of sub-Saharan African maize.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"The European Commission has announced new humanitarian assistance of €60 million to help people in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya, who have been facing critical levels of food insecurity due to severe drought.
This additional assistance brings EU humanitarian aid to the Horn of Africa region (including Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Djibouti) to nearly €260 million since the beginning of 2017.
""The situation in Horn of Africa has drastically deteriorated in 2017 and it keeps getting worse. Millions of people are struggling to meet their and their families' food needs. The risk of famine is real. The European Union has been following the situation closely since the very beginning and progressively increasing aid to the affected populations. This new package will help our humanitarian partners scale up the response further and keep bringing lifesaving assistance to people in need,"" said Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management Christos Stylianides.
The Horn of Africa region has been affected by prolonged drought brought on by a succession of failed rains. The most badly affected areas are south-eastern Ethiopia, northern Kenya, and Somalia where a pre-famine alert has been issued. Some 17 million people are in urgent need of food to survive, while the countries' coping capacities are exhausted. To further compound the situation, all three countries are grappling with a cholera outbreak.
EU humanitarian partners are already on the ground responding to the needs of the affected populations. The additional €60 million in EU assistance will support humanitarian partners in stepping up emergency food assistance and treatment of malnutrition. The aid will also support projects addressing water supply, livestock protection and response to disease outbreaks. The bulk of the funding (€40 million) will help the most vulnerable people in Somalia, while €15 million will go to Ethiopia and €5 million to Kenya.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"The city is implementing Level 4 water restrictions, which ask residents to limit daily usage to 100 liters (26 gallons) per person. The measure is meant to reduce demand and conserve what little water is still available, and means significant sacrifices for residents.
For Cape Town resident Suzanne Buckley, the restrictions mean adapting to a new lifestyle.
""We have buckets in our shower and bathroom sink to save excess water,"" Buckley said. ""The gray water is then used to flush our toilets.”、The restrictions are in effect across the city in an aggressive effort to preserve its remaining drinking water, but it may not be enough.
South Africa ranks as the 30th driest country in the world and is considered a water-scarce region. A highly variable climate causes uneven distribution of rainfall, making droughts even more extreme.
Speaking to CNN, Cape Town Executive Mayor Patricia de Lille explained her concerns about the growing water crisis.
""Climate change is a reality and we cannot depend on rainwater alone to fill our dams, but must look at alternative sources like desalination and underground aquifers.""
The Western Cape, one of the country's nine provinces and home to Cape Town, experiences its annual rainy season during the winter months (June-September). Capetonians are likely several weeks away from any substantial, drought-relieving rainfall.
Even then, predictions are dire for this winter as a potential El Niño develops off the west coast of South America, according to the Climate Prediction Center. If El Niño does materialize, it would have a negative effect on rainfall across the Western Cape.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"""We normally experience three or four months of drought,"" says the 59-year-old. ""But the last drop that fell here was last July.”
Experts say the water situation in East Africa is the worst the continent has seen since 2011, when a famine-inducing drought killed as many as 260,000 people in Somalia, Kenya and other parts of East Africa. According to UNICEF, 2.6 million Kenyans have become food insecure as a result of the lack of rainfall. The Kenya Red Cross reported at the beginning of this year that 5 percent of livestock in some areas of Kenya have died since the drought began last year.
Livestock accounts for an estimated 12 percent of Kenya's gross domestic product and more than 40 percent of its agricultural sector. The mass deaths of the animals are threatening the livelihoods of Kenyan pastoralists like Kwopin, who inhabit the arid and semi-arid lands that comprise 80 percent of the country. In times of drought, they must roam farther in search of grass over which they must compete with people from neighboring tribes.
Some pastoralists have resorted to cattle stealing to recoup their losses – at times through violence. The only solution to the insecurity, some experts say, may be for herders to change their long-held customs by planting and maintaining grass of their own for sustainable grazing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Parts of the province have been running a moisture deficit since November 2016.
“It’s almost as if nature has forgotten how to rain in parts of Saskatchewan,” Environment Canada Senior Climatologist David Phillips said.
According to the Canadian Drought Monitor, an area along the international border, including Coronach, is experiencing exceptional drought conditions.
Regina, Assiniboia and Swift Current regions continue to be in an extreme drought.
Severe drought conditions encompass Leader, Watrous and Estevan areas.
Below are the top 10 driest November to September periods on record for Regina, Moose Jaw, Swift Current, Yorkton and Saskatoon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"The word drought can be somewhat subjective and have various meanings for different people. When I think of what the word drought means, a period of prolonged dryness that reduces plant growth and/or causes damage to crops comes to my mind. A drought can be very short term, lasting several weeks or months (even as little as a few days for containerized plants) or last over an extended period of time (even multiple years). No two drought events are the same, but they all have one thing in common — the absence of water.
It’s not uncommon for various parts of the country to experience short- or long-term droughts with some regularity. With the potential for drought, its frequency at some locations as well as the possibility of water use restrictions, drought tolerance has certainly become an increasingly desirable characteristic of landscape plants. Keep in mind that some perennials are more drought tolerant than others.
Surviving Drought
The architecture of the leaves influences a plant’s ability to withstand drought. Thick, waxy leaves have the ability to store moisture. Hairy or fuzzy leaves tend to keep the moisture trapped near the leaf surface. And fine, lacey foliage allow plants to lose less water due to the reduced surface area.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"Sixty-six percent of the state is now in a drought, the highest percentage of any U.S. state, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. Parts of the state north of Lake Okeechobee are now enduring ""extreme"" drought, the second-worst level.
If the drought persists — which is expected — this could mean major crop and pasture losses, as well as widespread water shortages and restrictions, the Drought Monitor said. Burn bans, which prohibit the burning of yard debris, campfires, and bonfires, have already been issued across the state.
The drought has escalated dramatically since early February, when none of the state was in a drought.
Across the country, Florida's drought is the exception: Less than 5% of the U.S. is now in a drought, the lowest percentage in at least the past 17 years. Only Florida and a portion of northern Georgia are seeing extreme drought.
Not surprisingly, the drought is due to an ongoing lack of rainfall. ""Drier than normal conditions have persisted for several months"" in Florida, the National Weather Service said. Many Florida cities have seen far less rain than usual this year. Tampa has only seen about 5 inches of rain, compared to an average of about 10 inches.
Many other cities, including Jacksonville, Daytona, Orlando, Melbourne, and Fort Myers have all seen below-average rainfall so far in 2017, according to data from the weather service.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"Quick… If I say the word Florida, what images pop into your head? Palm trees, sandy beaches, rain and humidity?  However, rains were hard to come by this winter across Florida, leading to drought that currently ranks as the largest severe drought in almost five years for the state. As of May 4, an area of extreme drought has now been added to a half dozen counties.
In the latest update of the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 66% of the state was currently in some degree of drought. More than 39% of the state was in severe drought, 5% in extreme drought. That represents the largest portion of the state in severe drought since the beginning of June 2012.  And drought conditions have developed relatively rapidly as no part of the state was in severe drought as recently as only a month ago. What happened?
The better question is what didn’t happen. And the answer is rain. Rainfall totals during the winter were much below average. From December to February, central and most of southern Florida received 75% of its normal rainfall, with the driest areas seeing just 25-50%. And those months seem wet compared to the start of spring. In March, outside of localized areas in far southern Florida, the rest of the state recorded less than 50% of its normal rainfall, and large swaths of central and northern Florida were far lower, receiving less than 25% of their usual monthly rains. In absolute numbers, the driest areas saw less than an inch of rain in March. It was the ninth driest March on record back to 1895.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A Broward County Fire Rescue airboat had to be freed Wednesday after getting stuck in low water in the Everglades after helping to free a civilian airboat.
Over the past two months, drought conditions have developed and worsened over a sizable swath of the Florida Peninsula.
As of April 18, about half the state (46 percent) –  an area including an estimated 10.2 million residents – was classified in drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor analysis. This is the largest swath of the Sunshine state in drought since April 2, 2013.
The worst of the drought was a swath of central and southwest Florida, including Tampa/St. Petersburg, Fort Myers, Naples, Melbourne, and parts of the Orlando metro area.
Orlando International Airport had yet to receive any measurable rainfall this month through April 19, only the second time that has happened dating to 1953.
The paltry 0.10 inch of rain since March 1 was the driest spring-to-date rain total in 122 years of metro area records. Average rainfall from March 1-April 19 is 5.59 inches.
Fort Myers (0.35 inch; fourth driest) and Naples (0.89 inch; 10th driest) have also had a notably dry spring.

From the start of the year through Wednesday, Orlando has had 3.18 inches of rainfall, according to the National Weather Service. That's how much was recorded for the same period in 1907. The driest start on record, through May 10, was 2.64 inches in 1898.
Orlando did not get rain last month and has not had significant rain since mid-February.
The next decent chance, this weekend, ""doesn't look all that good,"" said the weather service's Derrick Weitlich.
To a degree, the city's gauge at Orlando International Airport has been unlucky, forecasters say, because surrounding cities have had a few or several inches more rain this year.
Still, a large part of Central and South Florida has been scorched; authorities are urging residents to ease up on lawn watering.
The weekly update Thursday of the U.S. Drought Monitor, a collaboration of government and academic experts, showed the state coverage of extreme drought expanding during the past week from 3,600 square miles to 5,400 square miles.

drought,,"Widespread drought in California and other parts of the western United States has been widely covered, but earlier this year,  drought conditions in southeast Florida were  “extreme” and are still considered “abnormally dry” according to the National Drought Mitigation Center. This heavily populated area of Florida – which is home to more than eight million people and includes the cities of Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach – is also a major agricultural area.
Even though Florida is in its rainy season, lasting from May until October, the South Florida Water Management District reports that May and June rainfall totals were well below average across most of the region. District weather records show that this May and June period was the driest since 2004 and the ninth driest since recordkeeping began in 1932. Of course, a tropical disturbance or hurricane that contains significant rainfall, like the one experienced last month, can make up at least some of this deficit, but waiting for weather isn’t something to rely on to fix the problem.
How can agricultural producers conserve water? One way is to get a free irrigation evaluation from a Mobile Irrigation Lab to get advice on an irrigation system that can save money and water.
When water is not applied uniformly on land it can be wasted and crops and plants can suffer. Applying too much water can also leach valuable fertilizers and pesticides past the crop root zone, wasting money and possibly harming the water quality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also on Thursday, the South Florida Water Management District issued a water shortage warning, telling the 8.1 million residents in its jurisdiction, which includes Martin and St. Lucie counties: Save water on your own now, or you may be forced to cut back in the future.
The St. Johns River Water Management District issued a similar water shortage warning in March for several of its counties, but not Indian River County.
The last time the entire Treasure Coast had a severe drought was 2011. That's also the last time the South Florida district issued mandatory watering restrictions, including twice-a-week landscape watering limits from Orlando to the Keys. South Florida golf courses and agriculture were required to reduce water use by 15 percent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"A national report shows Florida’s drought has escalated in key areas northwest of Lake Okeechobee to the “extreme” level.
About 6 percent of the state is now in an extreme drought – a level that could mean major crop, pasture losses, widespread water shortages and water restrictions.
This is the first report this  year to show extreme areas of drought in Florida.
Nationwide, only Florida and a small area of North Georgia are in extreme drought.
The drought  north of Lake Okeechobee means less water going into the lake and less water being discharged into the Caloosahatchee estuary.
During rainy years, this is a good thing, but the drier weather is hurting the Caloosahatchee this year and some people are asking for the discharges to be increased.
“The extremes hit us in both directions,” said Mark Generales, a member of the South Florida Water Management District’s Water Resources Advisory Commission, or WRAC. “You are giving us 300 cubic feet per second and we really need 650.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"Endless sunny weather with little or no rain in sight has prompted regional and local officials to warn that near-drought conditions could lead to water shortages unless residents begin conserving.
A water shortage warning has been declared by the St. Johns River Water Management District due to extreme drought conditions in the 18 Northeast Florida counties within its jurisdiction. The warning was expanded from seven of those counties named in an initial warning declared in March due to the effects of below-average rainfall across parts of the district.
The warning order aims to reduce water usage and increase awareness of the need for conservation. District officials said conditions have not yet reached a point where there is an expectation of insufficient water to meet anticipated demand and protect water resources, officials said. But current conditions do warrant heightened water conservation in all areas within its jurisdiction. That includes sticking to the current watering restrictions, which mandate residential landscape irrigation only between 4 p.m. and 10 a.m. and no more than two days per week.
Less than two weeks ago, JEA executives urged its water customers to conserve after a substantial 8.1 percent increase in usage over last year. The electric and water utility blamed two unusually dry years for last year’s increase, which was 6 percent higher than the previous year after downward trends in water consumption. Reasons for the increased use also included an unusually warm winter and substantially increased water used for irrigation, JEA officials said.
May and June are dry in Northeast Florida almost every year, with a rainy season that doesn’t usually begin until July and August. But while Northeast Florida usually gets 50 to 54 inches of rain a year, it only saw about 40 inches last year, JEA officials said.
The dry weather has led to many wildfires, the largest the lightning-sparked West Mims blaze that began April 4 in the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge in Florida’s Baker County and has now consumed about 152,230 acres as it continues to burn into Georgia’s Charlton County. It is only 18 percent contained, Florida Forest Service officials said. There are currently 94 active wildfires in Florida statewide burning about 39,925 acres.
The arid weather and the growing number of wildfires also forced Mayor Lenny Curry to extend Jacksonville’s burn ban last week restricting bonfires, campfires and other ceremonial fires through June 1, or until weather conditions improve. The dry conditions have forced 42 of the state’s 67 counties, including every one in Northeast Florida, to institute a burn ban, according to the Florida Forest Service.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"A newly released study warns of problems as the state’s population grows from 20 million to 35 million, and as water consumption jumps from 5 billion gallons a day to 8 billion by 2070.
The report, called Water 2070, was jointly authored by the state Department of Agriculture, the University of Florida and 1,000 Friends of Florida, a nonprofit geared toward sustainability.
“If we continue as we are, we’re going to have some severe problems, some severe shortages,” said University of Florida professor Peggy Carr, one of the researchers who contributed to the study.
Much of Southwest Florida is in the midst of a severe drought that has persisted for months. It’s left wells dry in Lehigh Acres and prompted Cape Coral to restrict lawn watering to only one day a week. It’s also helped contribute to the state’s worst wildfire season in at least six years.
The issue isn’t affecting Cape Coral’s drinking water, which comes from a different source than its irrigation supply. The city estimates it has enough drinking water to last 15-20 years.
But if Cape Coral or other Southwest Florida municipalities need to turn to a new drinking water source, the next closest option is the Avon Park aquifer. It could cost an average of four to five times more per household to bring water in from there, Cape Coral Water Production Manager Andrew Fenske said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"At the end of April 2017, just 6 percent of the United States was afflicted by drought, the lowest level in 17 years of analysis by the U.S. Drought Monitor. That’s a substantial turnaround from a few years ago, when long and short term droughts spread across much of the nation.
The news marks a downward trend from mid-2011, when many areas of the country began to experience drier-than-average weather. That summer, a headline in the U.S. Drought Monitor read: “‘Exceptional drought’ record for United States set in July.” By July 12, almost 12 percent of the contiguous United States was in an “exceptional” drought—including states as far flung as Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Florida.
“Two parts of the country that have composed a big portion of [its] drought area in the last decade, Texas and California, now have mostly normal conditions,” said Matthew Rodell, a hydrologist at NASA. “Texas’s drought broke in 2015, and California’s drought was alleviated by atmospheric rivers that brought heavy rains earlier this year. Combine that with recent precipitation across much of the northwestern and central parts of the nation, and the result is a much-wetter-than-normal map.”
The maps above show the U.S. as it looked on April 25, 2017, and roughly five years earlier, on August 7, 2012. Much of the country is currently drought-free (shown in white). One outlier, as shown in the image above, is Georgia (deep orange). Parts of the state remain in extreme drought, and water levels at the Lake Lanier reservoir have sunk 8 feet below full, according to authorities. Areas of Florida, too, continue to suffer from severe drought conditions—a stark contrast to early 2016, when it received record rainfalls.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"People in several Fort Myers neighborhoods are experiencing water shortages, as a drought persists in Southwest Florida, Friday.
Conditions have gotten so bad, the South Florida Water Management District issued a water shortage warning on Thursday. With more people in town during the dry season, demand for water is high, while supply is extremely low. The area has received nearly 6 inches less rain than average during this time of year, causing some wells to dry up. ""There's probably been three dozen or so wells in Lee County where wells have run dry,"" said Phil Flood from the South Florida Water Management District. ""This year, given the limited amount of rainfall we've had, we've really seen them lower than normal.”
This comes as several neighbors in the Florimond Manor area reported their private wells drying up. As a result, some have had to repair their systems, or drill deeper wells.
Neighbor Bernie Crews tells Fox 4 he is now watering his lawn only once a week, and hopes his neighbors do the same. He posted a sign at the corner of his street, asking his neighbors to conserve water in light of the warning. ""I wanted to let everyone in the neighborhood know that we're being affected by it and it's costing people money.""
He is referring the pricey repairs for well systems. If aquifer levels continue to sink, and motors continue running with no water to pump, those motors burn up. In that case, a contractor would have to elongate pipes into the well, or make the well deeper. ""You're looking at a $1,000 dollar repair, easy,"" said Crews.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"the ongoing drought could bring danger slithering right into your yard.
The dry conditions mean the most venomous snakes in Central Florida are on the move.
Herpetologist Bob Cross said low water levels in many lakes and swamps means snake sightings are more likely to happen in neighborhoods.
“It’s very frightening to think that they’re that they’re that close to a house,” Longwood resident Candy Bauer. ""I don't feel the same about my backyard.""
She found a cottonmouath in her backyard last night and called Cross to relocate the animal.
“Usually when people saw that, it’s a harmless water snake,"" Cross said. ""But in this case, the lady was right.""
He said the dry weather is forcing the cottonmouths and other snakes to seek water elsewhere.
""He’s going to be traveling like the gators,” Cross said.
He said a bite from a cottonmouth would cause severe pain and swelling.
""We'd be calling 911 and a helicopter for you,"" Cross said.
The snake found in Bauer’s yard will be sent to a facility in DeLand which will use it to produce anti-venom.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"Droughts and other climate-related weather events have a significant negative impact on food security, conflict and migration. Many regions in sub-Saharan Africa, including some of the poorest countries in the world, are particularly susceptible to droughts and need help to overcome them. Unfortunately, many countries and international community continue to regard droughts as unpredictable ""crises"" and often react with poorly coordinated emergency aid measures only after the damage was done.
The event will discuss the links between drought, food insecurity, conflict and migration. Droughts bring negative impacts in many ways, from poverty to food security, resource protection and energy supply. Conflicts around scarce water and support are pre-programmed. With increasing globalization, more and more people are indirectly affected, especially by the spread of local conflicts and unplanned mass migration. The event illuminates how droughts are linked, and the limits of sectoral policy approaches.
In addition, the need for proactive approaches to mitigate of the effects of droughts will be addressed. The complexity of the subject calls for a close dialogue between scientists and developmental practitioners to challenge conventional knowledge, to evaluate old solutions and to find new solutions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"One year after Australia’s 16-year drought ‘The Big Dry’ was confirmed to have broken, parts of Queensland and New South Wales were again declared to be in drought. The Bureau of Meteorology recorded rainfall deficiencies between April 2012 and January 2014, with most of Queensland and inland of the Great Dividing Range in New South Wales experiencing serious to severe deficiencies, having less than 70 per cent of their long-term average rainfall.
On 1 April 2013, 13 regional councils, the equivalent of one third of Queensland was covered by drought declarations. This grew to 60 per cent by October 2013 and by March 2014, 80 per cent of Queensland was officially in drought, including all 10 shires in the state’s north-west. As of 1 January 2015, there were 44 entire local government areas and three part local government areas drought declared, with another 78 Individually Droughted Property (IDP) declarations in an additional nine local government areas.
In May 2013, one sixth of New South Wales was in drought and by February 2014, 62 per cent of the state had received no significant rainfall for two years. Graziers experienced falling cattle prices and loss of income, with some having to shoot their stock or move them to other properties in response to deteriorating pasture and water availability.
In November 2013, the New South Wales State Government announced a $7.6 million package of emergency support to farmers in the Bourke, Brewarrina and Walgett councils and in February 2014 that was raised to $14.6 million. In January 2014, the Queensland State Government announced an extra $20 million would be added to the Drought Relief Assistance Scheme, taking the total to $31 million.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,2020.1.1 - 2021.8,"As temperatures recently reached triple digits, farmer Joe Del Bosque inspected the almonds in his parched orchard in California’s agriculture-rich San Joaquin Valley, where a deepening drought threatens one of the state's most profitable crops.
Del Bosque doesn’t have enough water to properly irrigate his almond orchards, so he’s practicing “deficit irrigation” — providing less water than the trees need. He left a third of his farmland unplanted to save water for the nuts. And he may pull out 100 of his 600 acres (243 hectares) of almond trees after the late summer harvest — years earlier than planned.
“We may have to sacrifice one of them at the end of the year if we feel that we don’t have enough water next year,” said Del Bosque, who also grows melons, cherries and asparagus. “That means that our huge investment that we put in these trees is gone.”
A historic drought across the U.S. West is taking a heavy toll on California’s $6 billion almond industry, which produces roughly 80% of the world’s almonds. More growers are expected to abandon their orchards as water becomes scarce and expensive.
It’s a sharp reversal for the almond’s relentless expansion in California’s agricultural Central Valley, whose dry Mediterranean-like climate and reliable irrigation system made it the perfect location to grow the increasingly popular nut.
Almond orchards are thirsty permanent crops that need water year-round, clashing with a worsening drought and intensifying heat waves tied to climate change. Scientists say climate change has made the American West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will keep making weather more extreme.
California almond production grew from 370 million pounds (nearly 168 million kilograms) in 1995 to a record 3.1 billion pounds (1.4 billion kilograms) in 2020, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. During that period, land planted with almond trees grew from 756 square miles (1,958 square kilometers) to 2,500 square miles (6,475 square kilometers).
In May, the USDA projected that California's almond crop would hit a record 3.2 billion pounds (1.5 billion kilograms) this year, but in July, it scaled back that estimate to 2.8 billion pounds (1.3 billion kilograms), citing low water availability and record heat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"For the first time, parts of Minnesota are in an ""exceptional"" drought as hot weather continues. 
According to the Minnesota Department of National Resources (DNR) Thursday, 7.37% of the state is in an exceptional drought classification while 42.2% of the state is in an extreme drought.
Most of the exceptional drought areas are in the northwest portion of the state. 
As a result of drought conditions, farmers are facing critical weeks ahead as they prepare to harvest crops.
Many say they are worried about the financial hit they will suffer after this dry summer.
Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, along with Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith, visited a farm Thursday to take a firsthand look at the toll this drought is taking on farmers.
Over the past several weeks, officials have announced federal emergency aid for farmers. Minnesota's share will be around $17 million.

drought,,"a partnership between the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration – reports that more than 60 million Americans are currently affected by drought conditions.
A multi-agency webinar discussing the status of the drought and response efforts in the region was held Tuesday, hosted by the National Integrated Drought Information System.
The webinar featured remarks from USDA and Interior Department officials, and an update from NOAA Administrator Richard Spinrad, who said the lingering drought costs the U.S. $63 billion annually, in addition to multibillion-dollar losses from wildfires. 
It's a crisis that Spinrad said will only worsen – citing the 1-in-1,000-year June heat wave – as climate change exacerbates the frequency, duration and intensity of drought.
David Simeral, a climatologist with the Western Regional Climate Center, blamed an overall lack of precipitation and rising  temperatures on top of 20 years of drought in the West for creating the current crisis. 
Above-normal temperatures are predicted to continue for the West and northern Plains through the fall, with below-normal precipitation ""modestly favored"" for that season as well.
Jon Gottschalck of the National Weather Service Climate Prediction Center also noted that La Niña climate conditions could also re-emerge in the autumn and winter months of 2021 to 2022.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"Lake Velence, a shallow, freshwater lake in central Hungary, is a haven for over 100 types of birds, dozens of species of fish and throngs of tourists who come to bathe in its waters for relief from the hot summers.
But many of the lake’s visitors, both animal and human, have disappeared as extreme heat has brought the water to dangerously low levels, something activists and environmental experts say threatens the country’s third largest natural lake with an economic and ecological crisis.
They say climate change and insufficient infrastructure are colliding, with devastating effect. The lake has lost nearly half of its water in the past two years as hot, dry summers have led to accelerating evaporation and deteriorating water quality.
“We are talking about years of rainfall deficit, drought and a continuous water shortage,” said environmental management engineer and activist Tibor Horanyi. “For years we’ve seen what role global warming is playing in our lives, and it’s clearly connected to this low water level.”
The optimal water level for Lake Velence (pronounced 'VEH-len-tseh) in August is 150 centimeters (5 feet), according to the local water authority.
But on Thursday, the water level stood at 80 centimeters (2 feet 7 inches), an amount of water that Horanyi called “critical.”
Hot, dry weather can result in as much as 1 centimeter per day evaporating from Lake Velence, according to official measurements. Those decreased levels have meant water temperatures are rising faster, causing diminished oxygen content, increased proliferation of algae and reduced water quality.
Following a long, cold spring, Hungary experienced its third hottest June since 1901 and then the hottest July on record, according to the national meteorological service.
The extreme heat caused the water temperature in the lake to rise by 10 degrees Celsius (18 F) within a week in June, Horanyi said, resulting in the death of more than four tonnes (8,800 pounds) of fish that were then removed by volunteers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The old record was 196.59 m (645 feet) set in 1977.
The California Department of Water Resources (DWR) State Water Project operations managers have taken the Hyatt Powerplant at Lake Oroville offline due to falling lake levels, California DWR Director Karla Nemeth said in a statement.
""This is the first time Hyatt Powerplant has gone offline as a result of low lake levels.""
""However, DWR anticipated this moment, and the state has planned for its loss in both water and grid management.

Meanwhile, Lake Mead, the reservoir created by the Hoover Dam on the Nevada-Arizona border and the largest in the U.S., has reached historically low levels as the water dropped to 326.61 m (1 071.57 feet) above sea level. Meanwhile, farmers are warning that water from reservoirs is unnecessarily being let out to sea.
Much of the western U.S. has been suffering from severe drought, extreme heat, and fire risk this year, with Northern California already declaring a water shortage emergency on Wednesday.
""Santa Clara County is in extreme drought. We can’t afford to wait to act as our water supplies are being threatened locally and across California,"" said Tony Estremera, director of the Santa Clara Valley Water District, in a news release.
""We are in an emergency and Valley Water must do everything we can to protect our groundwater resources and ensure we can provide safe, clean water to Santa Clara County residents and businesses.""
""Increased conservation is also necessary to protect local water supplies and guard against groundwater overdraft, subsidence, and dry domestic wells, especially if the drought extends into next year.""
Under the declaration, almost two million Northern California residents are being asked to reduce their water usage by 15 percent as compared to 2019. People are also advised to limit watering their lawns and filling their pools.

drought,,"Severe drought has caused California's reservoirs to run low, with Lake Oroville expected to reach a record low later this summer. Nearly three-quarters of the state is suffering from the extreme dry spell, with other areas facing a dire water supply situation and fears of wildfires.
Each year, Lake Oroville helps water a quarter of the nation's crops and sustain endangered salmon beneath its dam. However, the lake is seen to be shrinking at a surprising speed amid a severe drought.
According to AP, state officials are forecasting it will reach a record low as hot summer looms.
If the lake drops below 195 m (640 feet), which is possible by late August, officials would have to close down a major power plant for the second time ever due to low water levels that will strain the electrical grid during the hottest part of summer. The lake's record low is 197 m (646 feet).
While dry spells are common in California, this year is much drier than the previous seasons, with waters quickly evaporating from reservoirs.
At Lake Shasta, for instance, water levels ran low that campers have occupied dusty riverbanks.
More than 1 500 dams across the state are running 50 percent lower than they should be this time of the year, said Jay Lund, co-director of the Center for Watershed Sciences at the University of California-Davis. 
As of Tuesday, June 1, 2021, the state Department of Water Resources reported that 154 major dams across the state were 66 percent of average and the snow water equivalent for the snowpack was zero percent of normal for June 1.

Authorities in Taiwan have stepped up their battle against the country's worst dry spell in five decades, further reducing water supplies to many areas, including a major hub of semiconductor manufacturing.
Water supply will also be cut by 15 percent to companies in two major science parks in Taichung, according to economics minister, Wang Mei Hua. 
Non-industrial users across Taichung and Miaoli County will lose water supply two days a week beginning April 6, Wang added. 
The government is reportedly under pressure to ensure continuous supply to water-intensive industries, such as semiconductor manufacturing, at a time when companies are clamoring for chips. 
Meanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) said the restrictions would not affect their production.
""Some TSMC fabs will slightly increase the proportion of water from tanker trucks to improve flexibility. The new requirement for us to cut water usage by 15 percent starting April 6 will not impact our operations,"" it stated.

According to Claudia Sheinbaum, the mayor of Mexico City, the drought was the worst in three decades, and the problem is evident in lakes and reservoirs, which are now at critically low levels.
Nine million residents in the capital rely on reservoirs, including Villa Victoria and two others, which together are at 44 percent capacity. Most of the rest comes from wells within city limits, but the city's own water table is plummeting, and leaky pipes waste much of what is brought into the area.

""The reservoir is drying up. If they keep pumping water out, by May it will be completely dry, and the fish will die.""
Sheinbaum added that as the dry spell worsened, more people have tended to water their gardens, exacerbating the problem.

Before the current drought, Lake Cuitzeo was Mexico's second-biggest lake, with an area of approximately 300 - 400 km2 (120 - 150 mi2), and the site of a thriving fishing economy in Michoacán.
Now, this is a cemetery of abandoned fishing boats and a shortcut for motorists which creates frequent and prolonged dust clouds that reach municipalities 20 km (12.4 miles) away in Guanajuato.

In three months to January 2021, there was less than 50% of the normal quantity of rainfall. In addition, up to 60% of harvests are expected to be lost in the coming months.
Southern Madagascar recorded another below-average cumulative rainfall this season, particularly in the Alaotra Mangoro, Analamanga, Haute Matsiatra, and Ihorombe regions.
This is the fifth below-average rainy season reported in southern Madagascar in the last six years, with the Grand Sud affected by its most severe drought since 1981.
The worst affected are children and women, with three out of four children quitting school, mostly to help their parents forage for food.
As of May 12, there are at least 70 000 children who are acutely malnourished and the number is rising daily, Welthungerhilfe (WHH) reports.
If rapid emergency assistance is not provided, there is a risk that the famine will spread, endangering the lives of up to a million people, WHH said.

Nery Giménez, president of the Paraguayan Importers Center, told the AP that the country has never had a situation as serious as this one.
""We have never had a situation as serious as the one we are experiencing now. We are approaching the end of the year, a time when more products must enter.""
Gimenez added that the government had announced the lifting of pandemic-related lockdown, but the river crisis is threatening the resurgence of economic activity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"About half the population of southern Madagascar or 1.5 million people is suffering from drought-driven hunger, the UN World Food Program (WFP) reported on November 30, 2020. Three straight years of drought have eradicated harvests and hampered people's access to food.
""The hunger and malnutrition we're seeing is the result of three years of ruined harvests,"" said Moumini Ouedraogo, WFP’s Representative in Madagascar.
""Families across these drought-afflicted areas are adopting desperate measures simply to survive-- selling precious belongings such as cattle, farm tools, and kitchen utensils,""
In October, WFP started providing food aid for 320 000 severely food-insecure people in the 10 worst-hit districts, with hot meals for malnourished children and elderly in Amboasary, the epicenter of the crisis.
""The situation in the South demands an urgent response. People are left with nothing to eat and we must support them before it is too late, but for that to happen, urgent support from donors is needed now,"" Ouedraogo added.
The current resources can only accommodate 500 000 people through December, so the WFP appealed for 37.5 million dollars to rapidly expand its response, as well as to prevent child malnutrition rates from further worsening. The organization seeks to reach 891 000 people through June 2021.
The funds will also be allocated for emergency school feeding so children can continue studying, which WFP noted as the ""essential key to a better future.""
""The latest hunger surge underscores the magnitude of food insecurity across Madagascar, where almost half of the children under five are chronically malnourished, or physically stunted, meaning their brains and bodies may be irreversibly compromised,"" said WFP",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"More than 330 000 people in rural areas of southern and eastern China are facing a drinking water shortage due to drought affecting the region since October 2020, the government said. About 2.4 million people had already been impacted by the dry spell, and concerns are growing in other areas such as Guangxi, Hunan, and Yunnan.
More than 500 000 ha (1.2 million acres) of arable land had been hit by the drought, leaving more than 330 000 people without enough supply of drinking water, the Ministry of Water Resources said Thursday, February 4, 2021.
Since October last year, rainfall in southern regions of the Yangtze River had been 50 to 80 percent lower than normal.
So far, around 2.4 million people had already been affected by the drought in the provinces of Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Fujian. Meanwhile, concerns are growing in Guangxi, Hunan, and Yunnan, the ministry added.
In Taizhou in Zhejiang, residents of Snament county have been reeling from their worst dry spell in 50 years, state broadcaster CCTV reported.
Authorities have ordered the water supply to residents' homes to be turned off on alternate days, and non-essential businesses that consume large quantities of water were ordered to cancel their operations. In rural areas, drinking water is delivered to people by fire engines.
According to Yuan Yuan, deputy director of the China Meteorological Administration’s forecasting office, the drought was mostly caused by La Nina.
""The abnormal cyclone circulation has continued since October, and its intensity increased this winter.""
Qian Yonglan, a senior researcher at the National Meteorological Center, said the dry spell had already impacted winter crops, and if rainfall continues to be low, rice seeding and planting may also be affected.
""However, as early rice has not yet been planted on a large scale, the impact so far has been limited.""
The Zhejiang government is yet to release figures on the drought's effect on agricultural production but said that the lack of rain is likely to last until April.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow On (GRACE-FO) satellites showed indications of drought in European groundwater in a map taken on June 22, 2020.
According to the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), meteorological drought conditions began in eastern Europe in early spring 2020, then affected other parts of the continent with drier-than-usual weather in April and May. In late May and June, surface soil moisture and waterways recovered a bit after heavy showers.
In a seasonal review and forecast, C3S meteorologists forecast below-average precipitation for southern and eastern Europe in June, July, and August. The GEOGLAM Crop Monitor, a Group on Earth Observations, put most of central and eastern Europe, as well as southwestern Russia, under a watch for potential drought impacts on wheat production.
The GRACE-FO satellites presented a map showing shallow groundwater storage and root zone soil moisture in Europe as of June 22, 2020. The colors depict the wetness percentile. Blue areas have more water than normal, while orange and red areas have less. Darkest reds depict dry conditions that should take place only about once in every 50 years.
""Monitoring root zone moisture is essential for managing agriculture because it is the water naturally available for growing crops,"" Michael Carlowicz of NASA's Earth Observatory noted.
""Soil moisture at Earth’s surface and in the root zone can fluctuate significantly over short periods of time; it can be quickly replenished by rainfall, but also can evaporate rapidly during heat waves and dry spells. In fact, recent rains in parts of Europe have significantly reduced surface moisture deficits.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The dry spell around the Sekong, Sesan, and Srepok rivers are set to intensify this week and expand to large areas of Rattanakiri and Stung Treng provinces by Sunday, August 9.
The dry conditions are also forecast to extend to a portion of southern Laos, while severe drought is expected to hit Kratie and Mondulkiri provinces, as well as Vietnam's Central Highland.
Moderate drought conditions will reach central Laos and adjacent areas in northeast Thailand on the same day.
""Low-density rainfall in July is the main factor causing deficit soil moisture in the two driest areas of the LMB during the forecasting week,"" said the MRC Flood and Drought Management Center.
Elsewhere across Cambodia, low to heavy rain is forecast until August 11, MOWRAM said in a new forecast. People were advised to remain alert as thunderstorms, wind gusts, and high waves may take place.
During this period, temperatures in central lowland areas may vary between 25 and 32 °C (77 and 90 °F), 23 to 30 °C (73 to 86 °F) in the mountainous areas in the north and northeast, and between 24 and 32 °C (75 and 90 °F) in the coastal areas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"Up to 5.6 million ha (14 million acres) of crops in Iowa have been battered a powerful derecho that struck parts of the Midwest on August 10, 2020. Northern Illinois University meteorology professor Victor Gensini considers it as one of the worst weather events of 2020 for the country.
A powerful line of severe thunderstorms known as a ""Derecho"" tracked across eastern Iowa and northwest Illinois on the afternoon of Monday, August 10, 2020, producing widespread straight line wind damage. A swath of damage from Benton County, through portions of Linn, Jones, Cedar, and Clinton Counties, is consistent with intermittent straight line winds in the 160 -  210 km/h (100 - 130 mph) range, NWS said.
Maximum estimated winds were around 225 km/h (140 mph), which caused extensive damage to an apartment complex in southwest Cedar Rapids, IA. Straight line winds of this magnitude are equivalent to an EF-3 tornado.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture said a total of 5.6 million ha (14 million acres) of crops in Iowa were affected by the event. Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig specified that 1.6 million ha (4 million acres) of corn have been severely damaged, as well as 1 million ha (2.5 million acres) of soybean.
The storm exacerbated the situation for farmers as Iowa is already experiencing its most widespread drought since September 2013.
Dr. Charles Hurburgh, an expert in corn grain quality at Iowa State University's Extension and Outreach, said the crop damage is likely the biggest one he has ever seen.
""Largest area of coverage of multiple problems that I've ever seen and that's what makes it more of a challenge.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"The severe drought in North Island, New Zealand-- the worst in 50 years in some areas-- has prompted the Auckland Council's Emergency Committee to introduce mandatory water restrictions, which will be effective across the region beginning May 16, 2020.
This year's dry spell has hit hard and wide, according to the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) meteorologist, Ben Noll. NIWA's figures show that the areas of Whangarei, Whitianga, Hamilton, Tauranga, Whakatane, Napier, Taupo, and Auckland have had their driest January to April on record.
In response to the worsening drought, the Auckland Council's Emergency Committee voted unanimously on Thursday, May 7, to introduce mandatory water restrictions to take effect across the region next week.
""We really need Aucklanders to come together and reduce the amount of water we are using. As a city, we have done a good job to date, but given we have only had 36 percent of our usual rainfall we need to do more,"" said mayor Phil Goff.
""The last month has shown that if we put our mind to it, we can make the changes we need to help our city and that is what I am asking for of Aucklanders now with these water restrictions.""
He continued, ""The first stage of restrictions will ban the use of outdoor hoses and water-blasters. It will also prohibit the watering of sports fields, plants, or paddocks unless an irrigation system is fitted with soil moisture or rain sensors, and require car washes to operate only if they use recyclable water.""
Goff reminded Auckland citizens that if they don't save water, the council will have to implement stricter restrictions in the future.
""I hope Aucklanders will understand the need to adhere to these measures, but if we have to, we have a range of enforcement options available for those who choose to ignore the restrictions.”
The proposed restrictions cover outdoor water use as it can be observed, but none of the three stages impose restrictions on drinking water or sanitary use of water in households, as well as operations that use water for emergency, health, and biosecurity measures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"Farmers in Northern Ireland are facing the worst drought since 1976. It came after an unusually dry spell and the sunniest spring ever, with records dating back to 1929.
Allan Chambers, a member of the UFU's Seeds and Cereals Committee, said the lack of rainfall placed farmers under a dire situation. According to Met Office, this year's spring, which spans from March to May, was the sunniest on record for the region.
The season recorded an average of 564.4 hours of sunshine across the area's weather stations-- the average for a Northern Irish spring is 428.78. The Met Office also recorded an average of 125.3 mm of rain, which is only 52% of the spring average.
The average spring 2020 temperature for Northern Ireland was at 13.04 °C (55.47 °F), which was 1.25 °C (2.25 °F) higher than normal.
Chambers, a former chairman of the committee, is based outside Downpatrick and has three main crops-- winter barley, winter wheat, and forage maize. Both winter crops are in trouble, he said, while the maize needs rain.
""It’s been horrendous,"" Chambers described, pointing out that the situation feels worse than what the weather bureau indicated. His farm had only experienced as little as 15 to 25% of usual rain during spring.
""It just hasn’t rained for two-and-a-half months. I’m farming now for almost 60 years, and this is the most extreme spring that I have ever seen.”
""The closest we came to the drought situation was back in 1976. This has been even more severe.""
What makes it worse is that his crops were already suffering after the winter, which he said was the wettest four months ever.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The regional meteorological bureau and the regional department of agriculture and husbandry said the dry spell has reached about 44 million ha (110 million acres) in the area.
Since May, the central and western parts of the region have had less significant rainfall, accompanied by warming temperatures.
The dry weather remains severe in more than half of the pasturing areas across the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
On Monday, temperatures reached around 39 °C (102 °F) in the provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Jilin Liaoning, and in Beijing municipality, according to the China Meteorological Administration.
The administration forecast that in June, hot temperatures will rage in most parts of China for longer than the usual.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"More than 58 000 ha (143 000 acres) of rice have been damaged in Mekong Delta due to the region's worst drought in history, according to Vietnam's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD).
The MARD, in cooperation with the People's Committee of Long An Province, held a conference to discuss the results of the prevention of drought, saltwater intrusion, and water shortage during the 2019/20 dry season. The organizations also talked about solutions to develop sustainable agriculture.
The increase in saline intrusion was due to the water shortage from the upper Mekong River. During the 2019/20 dry season, the water to the Mekong Delta was lower than that in previous years, affecting 10 out of 13 provinces in the region. The area affected by salinity was 1.68 million ha (4.15 million acres), which was higher than the total area of 50 376 ha (124 481 acres) in 2016.
MARD cooperated with relevant ministries and the Mekong Delta provinces to actively cope with the situation and apply solutions, at the same time implement the Prime Minister's directive. 
Around 41 900 ha (103 500 acres) of winter-spring rice crop were affected this year, 26 000 ha (64 250 acres) of rice of which ended in a dead loss. Nearly 6 650 ha (16 430 acres) of fruit trees were impacted by saltwater intrusion, 355 ha (877 acres) of which was a total loss. More than 8 715 ha (21 500 acres) of the aquafarming area were damaged, as well as a wide swath of vegetable crops.
Also, due to prolonged drought, 96 000 families or about 430 000 individuals suffered water shortage for daily living, which was lower than the dry season in 2015/16 when there were 210 000 households affected.
Landslides occurred in many areas in the Mekong Delta as drought and prolonged shortage of water resulted in low water levels on the canals. 
Nguyen considered the drought and saltwater intrusion in the 2019/20 dry season as the most severe in history. However, the early guidance of the government has helped the agricultural sector to enforce coping solutions. The level of loss of agricultural production and livelihoods was also reduced significantly.
Last week, the intergovernmental Mekong River Commission (MRC) released a statement urging China to be more transparent over its dam operations on the Mekong River following the record lows of the water that threatened millions of livelihoods in various Southeast Asian countries.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Drought conditions have rapidly expanded since May, with almost 60 percent of the country already under a dry spell as of June 23, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.
21 out of 78 municipalities are suffering from moderate drought conditions, while 29 others are affected by a severe dry spell, governor Wanda Vasquez said.
On May 12, a few areas were abnormally dry but there were no spots classified in drought. The conditions expanded as rainfall deficits in parts of the country are running 102 to 203 mm (4 to 8 inches) below average over the last 30 days. 
Dry air linked to Saharan dust moving across the Caribbean has suppressed any chances of widespread rain, but there have been storms that are hit or miss.
About 140 000 homes and businesses will be affected by water rationing, which will cut off water for 24 hours every other day.
Some communities in the northeast region have already been experiencing water rationing since early June.
Local authorities have also taken other measures to provide water, such as using wells and changing the water source for more than 30 000 Carraizo clients to a different reservoir.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"The New Zealand army has been deployed to drought-stricken Northland to assist in relief efforts amid worsening drought conditions. Authorities described the situation as the worst drought on record.
The National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) said the severe drought is widespread across Northland, Auckland, and Waikato regions of the North Island, with medium-level droughts in the southern parts as well.
In Auckland city, just 5 mm (0.19 inches) of rain was recorded at the Motat weather station in January, which is the lowest since 1948 and just 7% of normal. Whenuapai had 7 mm (0.27 inches) of rain, the lowest since 1943 and 9% of normal.
North Shore marked its second-lowest rainfall total since 1966 with just 5 mm (0.19 inches) falling over the first month of the year.
The towns of Kaikohe and Kaitaia are the worst-affected, with severe water restrictions in force throughout February-- water is strictly for cooking and drinking only, or 40-second showers.
""We're running out of water,"" said the Far North council, adding that the goal is to promptly lessen water usage across the district by 25 percent.
There has been no major rainfall since November 2019, and areas of the North Island are facing its longest dry spell for seven years. According to weather forecasters, the drought conditions will continue as no significant rainfall is expected through the end of March.
""This is as probably as serious as it gets; this is the worst drought we've had on record,"" Kaitaia mayor John Carter said.
Soldiers from the NZ army has been deployed in the region and will be based in Kaitaia for two weeks. Furthermore, three medium-heavy army vehicles carrying huge loads of water were sent to Northland to help refill storage tanks in affected towns.
""It’s getting close to running out in 10 days or so if we keep taking at the rate we are, we could run out of water in the streams, which is significant,"" said Carter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"The drought situation in the Yucatan Peninsula in 2020 is shaping up to be worst in the past 34 years. Three years of below-average rainfall are merging, and groundwater levels are already pummeling to minimum levels, making this year's drought projections similar to major droughts that occurred in 1986 and 1962.
Aside from the devastating consequences of a dry period including extraction of water for agricultural use and human consumption, wildfires are also at high risk, with some of it already started.
February to May is Yucatan's dry season-- the time when farmers traditionally burn and clear fields for crops. However, the situation is also an urban crisis.
""The theory of climate change tells us that extraordinary meteorological events will occur in large urban spots,"" said meteorologist Juan Vasquez Montalvo from the Autonomous University of Yucatan (UADY) Meteorological Center. ""Therefore, Merida will be the city where the hot environment and high temperatures throughout the southeast of Mexico will suffer the most.""
""Everything indicates that the 2020 dry season will be the strongest since 1986,"" Montalvo said, adding that the situation is of utmost significance, considering that this year's dry spell ties in with that of 2019 and a part of 2018 when the rainfall was less than average.
Three years of below-average rainfall are merging, and groundwater levels are already pummeling to minimum levels.
The meteorologist, however, said the cause is still unknown. ""What is causing it? We don't know. The explanation may be a cycle that is repeating itself because the atmosphere lives cycles.""
""It could be the dry, descending air that is dominating and the high pressures that came this year-long before time, arriving at the end of January, when they normally do so in late March or early April, and these conditions have brought the drought ahead of time,"" he added.
Montalvo also enumerated signs that the worst of the situation is coming. First, the Maculis trees bloomed in February, instead of in March as what is usual. Also, the Ceiba trees bore fruit prematurely. Moreover, ants have been bringing food to their nests, which is ""an omen that a very severe drought is coming, and they are stocking up,"" he stated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"A severe drought in Chile's central region is entering its 10th year, setting a record for the country's longest dry-spell ever. Records since 1915, when the nation started data-keeping, showed that no droughts have lasted longer and that the previous megadrought of this scale likely occurred more than 1 000 years ago.
Over the past 10 years, rainfall in central Chile has been below normal every year by an average of 20 to 45 percent, which is extremely low. Around the capital Santiago (population 7 million), lack of rain has been particularly severe. Between 2014 and 2019, only 10 to 20 percent of normal rainfall has been recorded.
In 2019, the greater Santiago area in Valparaiso saw rainfall almost 80 percent below the previous record low. It was down by 90 percent in the northern region of Coquimbo.
According to Rene D. Garreaud, a scientist at the University of Chile, they are estimating that the last 'megadrought' of this scale probably occurred in this region more than 1 000 years ago.
The absence of significant rains has had long-term consequences, especially for farmers. Last year, the Ministry of Agriculture declared agricultural emergencies for more than 50 municipalities as tens of thousands of farm animals perished, and many others are at risk. Water supply systems are strained and reservoirs are drying.
Satellite images taken by the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat-8 show the drastic four-year difference of water levels at El Yeso, one of the main reservoirs in Santiago.
The first image was taken in March 2016, when the reservoir held about 219 million cubic m of water (7.7 billion cubic feet).
The second image was captured in March 2020, when the volume plummeted to 99 million cubic m (3 billion cubic feet)-- about 40 percent of capacity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"The Czech Republic is experiencing a catastrophic drought, threatening their harvest and supply of water, Environment Minister Richard Brabec announced Wednesday, April 29, 2020. This has been the country's worst dry spell in 500 years.
A map presented by the minister showing that just 0.1 percent of the nation had a normal level of water in the soil in mid-April, while 75.4 percent is facing severe drought.
Rain and snowfall have been declining in the past decade while warming temperatures led to periods of dry spells in the land-locked country. This year, the combination of warm winter and lack of precipitation led to a ""catastrophic"" situation, said Brabec. Scientists also showed data that the country is in its worst drought in five centuries.
""We are facing an unprecedented drought period, both in its duration and its impact,"" he stated. ""Smaller rivers will dry out, there may be tens, perhaps hundreds of communities supplied by cisterns, because their sources may dry out.""
The situation is worsened as most rivers flow out of the country and by intensive farming. In its Communist era of forced collectivization, fields were joined into some of Europe's biggest single-crop units, while other dividers were pulled out. This has reduced the landscape's ability to retain water, leaving the country grappling to maintain sustainable water levels.
The dry spell and warmer temperatures also led to the bark beetle spread, which infested the nation in 2019, resulting in about 1.7 billion dollars worth of damage.
The Environment Ministry is appealing for financial assistance to fight the drought-- a move that could help harvests, such as grains and rapeseed.
Although the COVID-19 crisis is the country's most pressing issue currently, Brabec noted that climate change and drought will become the biggest problems in the following years.
""Unless there is a miracle that would bring a month-long continuous rain, we will see rivers and streams dry out and tens or hundreds of villages with no source of drinking water.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles' (UCLA) Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, noted that this has not happened in 150 years or more.
""There have even been a couple of wildfires-- which is definitely not something you typically hear about in the middle of winter.""
Temperatures were warmer than average, and there is also no moisture in the forecast. ""The dryness has picked up as the season has gone on,"" Swain said.
The National Weather Service (NWS) also shared satellite photos showing the difference of snowpack on mountains between February 2019 and 2020.
""What a difference a year makes,"" NWS wrote, adding that so far, the snowpack is 58 percent below usual this time of the year.

CIMH advised authorities to carry out measures to alleviate fallout from a dry period which is expected to last possibly to the end of September 2020. 
Following the revelation of low figures during a press conference at CIMH's headquarters, general manager of the Barbados Water Authority Keithroy Halliday and Acting Chief Agricultural Officer Charleston Lucas affirmed that programs have begun to deal with the crisis ahead. The dry season usually starts in May.
The Barbados Meteorological Services recorded 736.5 mm (29 inches)-- 58 percent of average yearly rain and lowest in 77 years, while CIMH recorded 804.5 mm (31.7 inches)-- 63 percent of average conditions and lowest in 50 years. Prior to 2019's record, the driest year was 1947.
According to CIMH’s chief of Applied Meteorology and Climatology Adrian Trotman, last year's exceptionally dry conditions followed on from the same situation between 2014 to 2016 but worsened in 2019 particularly in the last six months.
In addition, Climatologist Dr. Cedric Van Meerbeeck said that although February to April is often the driest months, the impact from 2019's drought will be felt more significantly during this time.
""Having been in this drought for so long, what we expect is that the impact on the ground is going to slowly start increasing. So you are talking about plants withering and also about fire risk increasing, and about crop yields being affected at some stage,"" he noted, adding that models indicate it is going to be ""very dry.""
Van Meerbeeck also said that the situation may be aggravated with a probable late start to the wet season.
""We need to make sure that we monitor our resources and we need to make sure that we conserve as much as possible because by the end of May we will expect to see quite an impact on our water levels.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,2018-2019,"Australia's most populous state, New South Wales (NSW), is now entirely in drought, officials have confirmed.
A dry winter has intensified what has been called the worst drought in living memory in parts of eastern Australia.
NSW produces about a quarter of Australia's agricultural output. It was officially listed as ""100% in drought"" on Wednesday.
The state and federal governments have provided A$576m (£330m; $430m) in emergency relief funding.
""There isn't a person in the state that isn't hoping to see some rain for our farmers and regional communities,"" said NSW Minister for Primary Industries Niall Blair.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It brings the total amount of government funding to $576m.
Although it is still winter, parts of eastern Australia are experiencing the worst drought in living memory.
Ninety-nine percent of New South Wales, which is the country's most populous state and provides around a quarter of the country's agricultural output, is currently in drought.
Announcing the additional funding from a farm in the state, Mr Turnbull said: ""Now we are the land of droughts and flooding rains, we recognise that.
""It's a very volatile and often capricious climate and Australian farmers are resilient, they plan for drought, they are good managers but it can become really overwhelming.""
ABC News showed Mr Turnbull comforting a local charity worker, who wept as she described the ""dire"" situation.

drought,,"The worst drought in living memory is sweeping parts of eastern Australia, leaving farmers struggling to cope and asking questions about their future.
Record-low rainfall in some regions and successive seasons of above-average temperatures have blighted vast tracts of Australia's grazing and crop land.
While droughts are common in Australia, climate scientists say climate change is expected to cause longer and more intense droughts as well as greater extremes of temperature.
While the weather has improved in parts of Western Australia, winter rain has gone missing across much of the country's east, leaving farmers praying for rain after planting seed in dry soil or culling cattle and sheep they can no longer afford to feed.
New South Wales, which just recorded its fifth-driest July on record, has been hardest hit. About 99 per cent of the state - which accounts for a quarter of Australia's agricultural output by value - is now officially in drought.
The federal government on Sunday (Aug 5) announced a A$190 million (S$192 million) aid package for drought-afflicted farmers.
Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced the funding which will give farmers in need lump sum payments and support mental health initiatives and community groups. ""These are very exceptional circumstances and it's important that we react and respond with the support that farmers need,"" Turnbull told reporters. ""It is a shocking drought,"" Turnbull said at a farm in Trangie, west of the city of Dubbo in NSW.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"Brown is the color of summer in northern Europe this year.
Fields that are usually covered in lush green grass have now turned to dust, trees are shedding their leaves and animals eating dry hay or grain instead of grazing in pastures.
Farmers in around a dozen countries — from Ireland to the Baltics — are grappling with a once-in-a-generation drought. The unrelenting heat wave has devastated crops, with more than half of the harvest expected to be lost in some areas.
“I have never seen this type of hot and dry weather, and I’ve been farming over 30 years,” Max Schulman told NBC News from his farm about 35 miles outside of Helsinki, where he grows beans, oats, wheat and oilseeds.
Schulman says his farm has received just 3 inches of rain since the end of April, compared with 10 to 14 inches most years.
In many areas, the scale of the damage is not yet known as harvests have not been completed.
The drought has hit Denmark particularly hard, with the spring harvest of grains and vegetables down 40 to 50 percent, according to Troels Toft, an official with the Danish Agriculture and Food Council. He estimates that the losses will cost the country's farming industry around $944 million.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Record-low rainfall in some regions and successive seasons of above-average temperatures have blighted vast tracts of Australia’s grazing and crop land.
While the weather has improved in parts of Western Australia, winter rain has gone missing across much of the country’s east, leaving farmers praying for rain after planting seed in dry soil or culling cattle and sheep they can no longer afford to feed.
New South Wales, which just recorded its fifth-driest July on record, has been hardest hit. About 99 percent of the state – which accounts for a quarter of Australia’s agricultural output by value – is now officially in drought.

drought,,"Tourists flock by the thousands to the coastal town of Mendocino for its Victorian homes and cliff trails, but visitors this summer are also finding public portable toilets and signs on picket fences pleading: ""Severe Drought. Please conserve water.""
Hotels have closed their lobby bathrooms and residents have stopped watering their gardens in the foggy outpost about 150 miles (240 kilometers) north of San Francisco after two years of little rain sapped many of the wells Mendocino depends on for potable water.
Mendocino's water woes were compounded in recent weeks when the city of Fort Bragg a few miles to the north — its main backup water supplier — informed officials that it, too, had a significant drop in its drinking water reserves after the Noyo River recorded its lowest flows in decades.
""This is a real emergency,"" said Ryan Rhoades, superintendent of the Mendocino City Community Services District, which helps manage the water in the town’s aquifer.
Eric Hillesland and his wife normally wouldn't need to buy water until late July or August to supply the Alegria Inn, their 10-room oceanfront bed and breakfast. But the property’s well started pumping little water early in the year, and by February they were ordering 3,500 gallons (13 kilolitres) a week.
Then the couple stopped watering the gardens and switched from glass to paper plates to serve welcome cookies. They plan to start using microfiber bed linens, which take less water to wash.
""We’re also asking our guests to be cognizant of the severity of our water shortage and to not take the extensive showers they might be used to at home,"" Hillesland said.
Mendocino relies on groundwater accessed through a network of about 400 privately owned wells, many of them dug by hand when the former mill town was established in the 1850s. Residents and business owners keep their water in storage tanks, including some perched atop historic redwood water towers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

drought,,"The wheat harvest on Marci Green’s farm doesn’t usually begin until late August, but a severe drought stunted this year’s crop and her crews finished harvesting last week because she didn’t want what had grown so far to shrivel and die in the heat.
It’s the same story across the wheat country of eastern Washington state, a vast expanse of seemingly endless stretches of flatlands with rolling hills along its edges that produces the nation’s fourth largest wheat crop. It’s been devastated by a drought the National Weather Service has classified as “exceptional” and the worst since 1977.
“This is definitely the worst crop year we have had since we started farming 35 years ago,” said Green, whose family is the sixth generation on the same farming land just south of the city of Spokane.
She estimated her farm’s wheat crop this year at half of normal, and of poor quality.
Green grows soft white winter wheat, a variety that is prized in Asian countries because it is excellent for making pastries, cakes, cookies and noodles.
At least Green will have some wheat to sell. Some Washington wheat farms produced almost none because of the drought.
“We’re seeing complete crop failure in some areas,” said Michelle Hennings, executive director of the Washington Association of Wheat Growers in the small community of Ritzville, in the heart of the state’s wheat growing region.
Only about 10 percent of Washington’s wheat crop comes from farms with irrigation. The rest of the farms rely on rain, which has been rare in what is shaping up as one of the hottest summers in the state’s history.
The current estimate for the crop is 117 million bushels, down from last year’s 165 million, and there is a good chance the crop will be smaller than 117 million, said Glen Squires, director of the Washington Grain Commission, which represents farmers. A bushel is about 60 pounds (27 kilograms).
Oregon and Idaho also produce soft white winter wheat, and their crops have also been hurt by drought, Squires said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"Idaho is facing unprecedented drought despite getting normal snow levels last winter, and water managers warn the state could be entering a dry spell that may last for years.
“Idaho is in the midst of a drought that is unprecedented in recent memory, mostly due to an exceptionally dry spring followed by a summer heat wave,” David Hoekema, hydrologist for the Idaho Department of Water Resources, wrote in a new analysis, the Idaho Press reported. “Without a snowpack that is significantly greater than normal next winter, Idaho could be seeing several years with limited water supply.”
Few saw this coming, as Idaho began the year with normal snowfall in the mountains, though temperatures were above normal every month but February. Then came a dry spring, followed by a blistering hot summer. The state’s basins all experienced the hottest June and July on record, Hoekema said.
“With storage being rapidly depleted across the state, concern is rising that we may be entering into a multiyear drought,” he said.
Still, it’s not the driest year on record in Idaho. That came in 1977, Hoekema said, which became known as “the year without snow.” Historically, Idaho’s drought years have followed winters with poor snowpack levels.
Irrigation-reliant farmers saw the reasonable snowpack levels in late March and planted accordingly, not expecting the dry, hot weather that followed.
“This year’s a really tough water year for farmers in Idaho,” said Sean Ellis, spokesman for the Idaho Farm Bureau Federation. “If they could’ve foreseen this … there would’ve been some farmers that would’ve switched from higher-water crops like sugar beets and potatoes into lower-water crops” like barley, wheat, hay and dry beans.
Thanks to the reservoirs, many farmers’ crops will survive the season, Ellis said, though many are reporting lower yields. Next year could be more troublesome.
“We finished last year’s irrigation season with carryover water that was above normal,” Ellis said. “This year, we’re not going to do that.”
Hoekema wrote in his report that it could take several years for some of the state’s reservoirs to recover. That means less water for everything from irrigating crops to providing water for fast-growing communities, and water officials around the state are strongly urging conservation.
SUEZ Water, which serves 240,000 people in Boise and the surrounding area, reported in late July that its customers’ water use was up 15%, using a billion gallons more than anticipated, largely for lawn-watering amid the heat. It urged water-saving measures, including limiting lawn-watering and not watering during the heat of the day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"I walk in the front door of Byron Carter’s house as others are entering in the back, and Koda the dog can’t decide which way to direct her barking. I’m in Divide County, North Dakota, but borders seem a little meaningless here. Last summer’s drought, which was calamitous for Byron and the other farmers and ranchers now filing into his kitchen, leaked over into Canada, Divide’s border to the north, and Montana, to the west. By April of this year, they’re on the cusp of a new season, and Byron has gathered his neighbors—defined as anyone living within a 30-mile radius in this sparsely populated corner of the state—so we can talk about drought and climate change.
Drought is an especially wily adversary. As an officer of the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services told me recently, “You can’t put up a sandbag wall to stop a drought.”
In Divide County, agricultural producers are especially vulnerable to the effects of drought, since they depend on dryland methods. Dryland farmers use no irrigation. Instead, they rely wholly on rain: to initiate the lush growth of little bluestem and other pastureland grasses that will sustain their herds through the summer, and to secure the hay harvest that will get the herd through the winter. Not to mention the rain they need for their wheat, barley and pea cash crops.
In 2017, ranchers were optimistic when they put their cattle out to graze in late spring. There’d been record snowfall over the winter, and regional forecasts weren’t calling for any drought conditions in their northwest region of the Great Plains. By May, though, concerns were rising. Rain failed to come, and the good winter moisture evaporated into a cloudless sky. By July, two-thirds of the pastureland in the Dakotas was in poor condition, and across the High Plains, from Kansas up to Canada, temperatures were above normal while precipitation was low—perfect conditions for what’s known as a “flash drought,” sudden and severe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"On the Western Slope, a truly cataclysmic summer is emerging. The next few months look to be the driest in anyone’s memory.
At the headwaters of the Colorado River, water scarcity is now creating dire consequences for ranchers and their surrounding rural communities. Poor snowpack and sporadic rain have turned once lush pastures into meadows of weeds and dust. Livestock and native grazers are competing with wild horses for shrinking water sources. Catastrophic wildfires are threatening to change entire watersheds, reducing grazing capacity and even shutting down some farmers permanently.
Federal forest lands, a critical source of the west’s water supply, are in poor and unnatural condition. Forest health has a direct connection to watershed health and the water supply that millions depend upon. The reduction in upper watershed flows is directly correlated to the health of the forests.
Without new ways to capture altered streamflow patterns, we will be left with collapsing systems that will impact food production, migratory birds, fish and ecosystem biodiversity.
Across the country, extreme weather events are only getting worse, totaling billions of dollars in damages each year. It is clear that we need solutions that will address the very real and present threat of climate change. With dry years increasingly the norm in Colorado and much of the West, the infrastructure package currently being debated in Washington, D.C., takes on an added sense of urgency and must include significant federal investments in Western water infrastructure.
Persistent drought conditions place at risk our thriving population centers, deep ecological heritage, and world-class farms and ranches.
Eleven national forests and four national parks are a source of state pride and provide millions of acres for environmental benefit and year-round outdoor recreation. Warmer, drier conditions will increase the frequency and severity of wildfires and make our forests more susceptible to pests such as the mountain pine beetle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"Amid a precarious security situation in Afghanistan, the worst drought in recent history, that hit two out of three provinces in Afghanistan in July, has destabilised the lives of tens of thousands of civilians, some of whom have already been displaced.
The UN has predicted that over two million people are expected to become severely food insecure in the coming period.
The West Region of conflict-stricken Afghanistan has been hardest hit by the drought, and over 60,000 people have been displaced to Herat and Badghis provinces, as a result. Families that fled to Herat are living in dire conditions in makeshift shelters, where they are exposed to the scorching sun and summer temperatures of over 40 degrees Celsius. Many families are subsisting on a single meal a day. Many get by on just bread and water.
Herat has become the closest refuge for about 60,000 people, who have been displaced from their homes due to the drought. Conflict has also prompted many to flee their homes to the relative safety of province. Over 1,700 civilians were killed in Afghanistan during the first half of 2018, according to the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA). It is the highest recorded number, compared to the same periods for the past decade. The combination of drought and conflict has made tens of thousands of families destitute. They live amid precarity and with few long term prospects or means of regaining stability.

drought,,"The dry times are back. 
Drought has returned with a vengeance across much of the United States, with the worst conditions across southern and western parts of the nation.  
As of Thursday, 38.4% of the continental U.S. is in a drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. That is the highest percentage since the 40% recorded in May 2014.  
In California, which emerged from a brutal four-year drought last year, 44% of the state is now considered to be in a moderate drought. That's a dramatic jump from just last week, when the figure was 13%.
The Sierra provides water to millions of Californians. ""It's not nearly where we'd like to be,"" Frank Gehrke, a state official, said after measuring winter snowfall in the Sierra on Thursday.
Extremely warm weather is causing most of the precipitation to fall as rain instead of snow. ""This will have major ramifications for western water managers if they don’t get some major winter storms soon,"" Heim said.
Major winter storms have mostly bypassed the West, meaning that much-needed mountain snow has not fallen, said NOAA meteorologist Richard Heim, author of this week's Drought Monitor. This winter, snow sensors across the Sierra Nevada show the snowpack is just 30% of average for this time of year.
Whether California heads into another drought cycle will depend largely on how much rain and snow falls during February and March. 
Further east, the amount of snow on the ground is also far below average across the Colorado River Basin, where a 17-year run of mostly dry years has left reservoirs at alarmingly low levels.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drought,,"Between 2015 and 2017 South Africa’s South Western Cape region experienced three of its lowest rainfall years on record. This led to the progressive depletion of water supply reservoirs and by the summer of 2017/18 there was a real danger that – without drastic reductions in water use – the region, and especially the city of Cape Town, would run out of water.
Droughts close to this magnitude have occurred in the past (for example in the late 1920s, early 1970s, and 2003 to 2004) and led to water shortages in Cape Town. But are they getting worse?
The reliable yield of the South Western Cape water system has, until now, been calculated under the assumption of a stationary climate. This is the idea that past rainfall can be used to estimate present day as well as future rainfall, and then also water system yields. A water resource model is used to estimate the frequency of failure under all the known past rainfall conditions – in the case of this region, the last 80 or so years. The water system is then designed to be fairly reliable. The supply system for Cape Town and surround areas was designed to maintain supply without imposing water restrictions 98% of the time, or – on average – 49 out of every 50 years.
It’s known that the climate is going to change in the future, as a succession of international scientific assessments have shown. And many water resource planners are taking climate change into account when upgrading existing or designing new water supply systems.
But has this changing global climate already altered the risk of droughts like the one Cape Town just experienced?
We assessed this in a recently published analysis. Using a range of modelling approaches, we first estimated the frequency and intensity of three-year rainfall amounts over the South Western Cape in a world without human-induced warming of the climate.
We then compared this to drought risk in the world we actually live in, where greenhouse gases and other pollutants have warmed the planet by about one degree.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Lake Velence, a shallow, freshwater lake in central Hungary, is a haven for over 100 types of birds, dozens of species of fish and throngs of tourists who come to bathe in its waters for relief from the hot summers.
But many of the lake’s visitors, both animal and human, have disappeared as extreme heat has brought the water to dangerously low levels, something activists and environmental experts say threatens the country’s third largest natural lake with an economic and ecological crisis.
They say climate change and insufficient infrastructure are colliding, with devastating effect. The lake has lost nearly half of its water in the past two years as hot, dry summers have led to accelerating evaporation and deteriorating water quality.
“We are talking about years of rainfall deficit, drought and a continuous water shortage,” said environmental management engineer and activist Tibor Horanyi. “For years we’ve seen what role global warming is playing in our lives, and it’s clearly connected to this low water level.”
The optimal water level for Lake Velence (pronounced ’VEH-len-tseh) in August is 150 centimeters (5 feet), according to the local water authority.
But on Thursday, the water level stood at 80 centimeters (2 feet 7 inches), an amount of water that Horanyi called “critical.”
Hot, dry weather can result in as much as 1 centimeter per day evaporating from Lake Velence, according to official measurements. Those decreased levels have meant water temperatures are rising faster, causing diminished oxygen content, increased proliferation of algae and reduced water quality.
Following a long, cold spring, Hungary experienced its third hottest June since 1901 and then the hottest July on record, according to the national meteorological service.
The extreme heat caused the water temperature in the lake to rise by 10 degrees Celsius (18 F) within a week in June, Horanyi said, resulting in the death of more than four tonnes (8,800 pounds) of fish that were then removed by volunteers.
Otto Balogh, a local fisherman, told The Associated Press that the conditions in the water were clearly visible, and had impacted his catch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Officials also began city-wide testing amid criticism for their ""failure"".
All 9.3 million of the city's residents - including those visiting - will be tested, said state-controlled Xinhua news.
Posts on social media show long lines of people queuing, and authorities have reportedly urged people to wear masks, stand one metre apart and avoid talking while they wait.
Officials said the highly contagious Delta variant of the virus was behind the infections, adding that cases had spread further because of how busy the airport is.
Ding Jie, a health official in Nanjing, told reporters the cases were linked to cleaners who worked on a flight from Russia that arrived in the city on 10 July.
The cleaners did not follow strict hygiene measures, Xinhua News reported.
The airport management has been rebuked, with a senior disciplinary body of the Communist Party saying it had ""problems such as lack of supervision and unprofessional management"".

However, experts quoted by the Global Times said they believed the outbreak was still at an early stage and could be controlled.

It is thought to be the first-ever legal settlement of its kind.
Under the terms of the deal, claimants will be given compensation based on court-determined level of harm.
Money will also be set aside for a DNA database to allow dozens of children to identify their biological fathers.
The class-action lawsuit currently includes 226 people. Dr Barwin worked at two clinics in Ottawa, Ontario.

Some of the claims date back to the 1970s. Dr Barwin is now in his 80s and has not practiced since 2014.
The settlement must still be approved by a judge before any money will be made available.
Rebecca Dixon, 31, found out that her real father was Dr Barwin - whose clinic her parents had visited - after she developed a disease that nobody else in her family had. She and her parents launched the lawsuit in 2016.

""It is something that will be with us for the rest of our lives. But the legal side wrapping up will allow people to come to a bit more peace with the situation.""

The announcement came after Mr Biden held talks with Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi at the White House.
There are currently 2,500 US troops in Iraq helping local forces counter what remains of the Islamic State group.
Numbers of US troops are likely to stay the same but the move is being seen as an attempt to help the Iraqi PM.
The US presence in Iraq has become a major issue since top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani and the leader of an Iran-backed Shia Muslim militia were killed in a US drone strike in the capital Baghdad last year.
Political parties aligned to Iran have demanded the withdrawal of all forces from the US-led global coalition against IS, despite the continuing threat posed by the Sunni jihadist group.
Shia militias have meanwhile been accused by the US of carrying out hundreds of rocket, mortar and drone attacks on Iraqi military bases that host coalition forces in an apparent attempt to pressure them to leave.
For the US president, the announcement marks the end of another war that began under former President George W Bush. This year he said US troops would leave Afghanistan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index, which follows the 98 biggest US-listed Chinese stocks, has fallen by almost 15% in the last two trading sessions.
The index has now plummeted by more than 45% since hitting a record high in February.
The slump comes after a series of crackdowns by Beijing on its technology and education industries.
This has led to around $770bn (£556bn) being wiped off the value of US-listed Chinese stocks in the last five months alone.
The latest blow came as Beijing unveiled a massive overhaul of China's $120bn private tutoring sector, under which all institutions offering tuition on school curricula will be registered as non-profit organisations.
The new rules also said: ""Curriculum subject-tutoring institutions are not allowed to go public for financing; listed companies should not invest in the institutions, and foreign capital is barred from such institutions.""
That pushed down the stock market value of private education firms in the US, Hong Kong and mainland China.

Having remained unchanged at 0.75% over the first five months of this year, the three-month domestic interbank rate rose to 0.81% by end-June, and further to 1.44% by end-September.  However, reflecting the ample liquidity in the banking system, retail interest rates have thus far remained unchanged.  Meanwhile, lending activities in the domestic banking sector have continued to improve gradually, supported by an increase in housing loans, and to a lesser extent, credit extended to the corporate sector, as business prospects improved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The unemployment rate dropped in May to 4.7 percent, its lowest level since late 2007; however, the labor force participation rate fell back again and was little changed from its year-ago level.

Nevertheless, a range of labor market indicators suggest that there is still room for improvement. In particular, at 5.7 percent, the unemployment rate is still above most FOMC participants' estimates of its longer-run normal level, the labor force participation rate remains below most assessments of its trend, an unusually large number of people continue to work part time when they would prefer full-time employment, and wage growth has continued to be slow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other measures of labor market activity also point to ongoing improvement in labor market conditions even as they continue to suggest that further improvement is needed to achieve the Committee's maximum employment mandate.

With these gains, payrolls have risen a cumulative 3-1/4 million and the unemployment rate has declined 1-1/2 percentage points since August 2012, the month before the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) began its current asset purchase program.

As the effects of these factors waned over the second half of the year, economic activity picked up. Conditions in the labor market have improved since last summer, with an increase in the pace of job gains and a noticeable reduction in the unemployment rate. Meanwhile, consumer price inflation has stepped down from the temporarily high levels observed over the first half of 2011, as commodity and import prices retreated and as longer-term inflation expectations remained stable. Looking ahead, growth is likely to be modest during the coming year, as several factors appear likely to continue to restrain activity, including restricted access to credit for many households and small businesses, the still-depressed housing market, tight fiscal policy at all levels of government, and some slowing in global economic growth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A number of factors will likely restrain economic growth in the period ahead, including weak economic growth abroad and a fiscal environment that looks set to become less accommodative. Uncertainty about these factors may also restrain household and business spending. In addition, credit conditions are likely to improve only gradually, as are still-elevated inventories of vacant and foreclosed homes.

In light of these developments--and in order to put the economic recovery on a firmer footing--the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) provided additional monetary policy stimulus during the second half of 2010 by reinvesting principal repayments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in longer-term Treasury securities and by announcing its intention to purchase an additional $600 billion of Treasury securities by the end of the second quarter of 2011.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nonetheless, even after setting aside temporary influences, the growth of economic activity appears to have slowed over the first half of this year. Conditions in the labor market remain weak. Although the average pace of job creation picked up during the early months of the year, employment growth softened in May and June and the unemployment rate edged up. Meanwhile, consumer price inflation increased noticeably in the first part of the year, reflecting in part higher prices for some commodities and imported goods as well as shortages of several popular models of automobiles.

These factors, along with increased business and household confidence, appear likely to boost spending and sustain the economic expansion. However, the pace of the recovery probably will be tempered by households' desire to rebuild wealth, still-tight credit conditions facing some borrowers, and, despite some tentative signs of stabilization, continued weakness in labor markets. With substantial resource slack continuing to suppress cost pressures and with longer-term inflation expectations stable, inflation is likely to be subdued for some time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nonetheless, credit conditions for many households and businesses remain tight, and financial markets are still stressed.

Substantial strains have emerged in financial markets here and abroad, and housing-related activity has continued to contract. Also, further increases in the prices of crude oil and some other commodities have eroded the real incomes of U.S. households and added to business costs. Overall economic activity held up reasonably well into the autumn despite these adverse developments, but it decelerated sharply in the fourth quarter. Moreover, the outlook for 2008 has become less favorable since last summer, and considerable downside risks to economic activity have emerged. Headline consumer price inflation picked up in 2007 as a result of sizable increases in energy and food prices, while core inflation (which excludes the direct effects of movements in energy and food prices) was, on balance, a little lower than in 2006. Nonetheless, with inflation expectations anticipated to remain reasonably well anchored, energy and other commodity prices expected to flatten out, and pressures on resources likely to ease, monetary policy makers generally have expected inflation to moderate somewhat in 2008 and 2009. Under these circumstances, the Federal Reserve has eased the stance of monetary policy substantially since July.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The U.S. economy remained sluggish in the first half of 2008, and steep increases in commodity prices boosted consumer price inflation. The housing market continued to contract, weighing on overall economic activity. Against a backdrop of mounting losses incurred by major financial institutions, financial market conditions deteriorated sharply further toward the end of the first quarter--a development that threatened to severely impair the functioning of the overall financial system and to hinder economic growth. In response, the Federal Reserve undertook a number of significant actions to address liquidity pressures faced by banks and other financial institutions, thereby augmenting the liquidity-enhancing measures implemented in the second half of 2007. Taken together, these measures fostered some improvement in the functioning of financial markets, but considerable strains persist. In view of the implications of the substantial reduction in credit availability and the continuing decline in housing activity for the economic outlook, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) further eased the stance of monetary policy. After cutting the target federal funds rate 100 basis points in the second half of 2007, the FOMC reduced rates another 225 basis points over the first four months of 2008. The further easing of policy was seen as consistent with fostering price stability over time, given the Committee's expectation that a flattening-out of energy prices and increasing economic slack would damp inflationary pressures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The U.S. economy delivered a solid performance in 2005 despite a further sharp increase in energy prices and devastating hurricanes that claimed many lives, destroyed homes and businesses, and displaced more than 1 million persons. Real gross domestic product is estimated to have risen a little more than 3 percent over the four quarters of 2005 even though growth slowed significantly in the fourth quarter as a result of storm-related disruptions and other factors that are likely to prove transitory. The increase in real GDP in 2005 was sufficient to add 2 million new jobs, on net, to employers' payrolls and to further reduce slack in labor and product markets. As in 2004, overall consumer price inflation was boosted by the surge in energy prices. Core consumer price inflation (as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding the direct effects of movements in food and energy prices) picked up early in the year, but it subsequently eased and totaled less than 2 percent over the year as a whole. The dollar appreciated against most major currencies in 2005, and, with domestic demand expanding strongly, the U.S. current account deficit widened further.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With fiscal policy stimulative, monetary policy accommodative, and financial conditions favorable, household spending remained buoyant and businesses increased investment in capital equipment and inventories, despite the restraint imposed by sizable increases in oil prices. Labor market conditions improved significantly, albeit at an uneven pace, and productivity rose notably further. Consumer price inflation moved higher with the surge in energy prices, but core consumer price inflation (that is, excluding food and energy) remained well contained, and measures of expected inflation over longer horizons held steady or edged lower.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The U.S. economy continued to expand at a solid pace over the first half of 2005 despite the restraint imposed on aggregate demand by a further rise in crude oil prices. Household spending trended up, propelled by rising wealth and income and by low interest rates, and business outlays received ongoing support from favorable financial conditions, rising sales, and increased profitability. Moreover, the earlier declines in the foreign exchange value of the dollar shifted some domestic and foreign demand toward U.S. producers. Overall, the economic expansion was sufficient to create jobs at roughly the same pace as in late 2004 and to lower the unemployment rate further over the first half of this year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The economic expansion in the United States gathered strength during 2003 while price inflation remained quite low. At the beginning of the year, uncertainties about the economic outlook and about the prospects of war in Iraq apparently weighed on spending decisions and extended the period of subpar economic performance that had begun more than two years earlier. However, with the support of stimulative monetary and fiscal policies, the nation's economy weathered that period of heightened uncertainty to post a marked acceleration in economic activity over the second half of 2003. Still, slack in resource utilization remained substantial, unit labor costs continued to decline as productivity surged, and core inflation moved lower. The performance of the economy last year further bolstered the case that the faster rate of increase in productivity, which began to emerge in the late 1990s, would persist. The combination of that favorable productivity trend and stimulative macroeconomic policies is likely to sustain robust economic expansion and low inflation in 2004.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

other,,"The impressive performance of the U.S. economy persisted in the first half of 2000 with economic activity expanding at a rapid pace. Overall rates of inflation were noticeably higher, largely as a result of steep increases in energy prices. The remarkable wave of new technologies and the associated surge in capital investment have continued to boost potential supply and to help contain price pressures at high levels of labor resource use. At the same time, rising productivity growth--working through its effects on wealth and consumption, as well as on investment spending--has been one of the important factors contributing to rapid increases in aggregate demand that have exceeded even the stepped-up increases in potential supply. Under such circumstances, and with the pool of available labor already at an unusually low level, the continued expansion of aggregate demand in excess of the growth in potential supply increasingly threatened to set off greater price pressures. Because price stability is essential to achieving maximum sustainable economic growth, heading off these pressures has been critical to extending the extraordinary performance of the U.S. economy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the absence of the latest virus outbreaks and lockdowns, the outlook would have been noticeably upgraded from 3 months ago.The recent outbreaks of the Delta variant of the COVID-19 virus are interrupting the recovery. The near-term outlook is highly uncertain and dependent on health outcomes. Further large outbreaks are possible, but the need for extended lockdowns should diminish as vaccination coverage increases. GDP will contract noticeably in the September quarter, and it is expected that employment will decline and the unemployment rate increase for a time. The experience of previous lockdowns is that much of the labour market adjustment will come through a decline in hours worked and labour force participation. The longer the lockdowns continue, however, the more likely it is that jobs are lost.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The successful development of COVID-19 vaccines has improved the medium-term outlook for global growth. Vaccination programs are underway in a number of countries. As these are rolled out, health-related restrictions can be eased and many types of activity can return to something close to their pre-pandemic trends. In the near term, however, some momentum in the global economy has been lost, as infection rates have surged in a number of economies and lockdown measures have again become necessary. The recovery is likely to be bumpy and uneven, and dependent both on the health situation and ongoing fiscal and monetary policy support. Spare capacity will remain for some years, dampening inflationary pressures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Economic developments continue to be driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and the responses to it. The initial outbreaks prompted significant restrictions on activity and resulted in very large contractions in output. Most economies have been recovering from these initial contractions. But in most cases, economies still remain well below pre-pandemic levels, and in Europe fresh outbreaks are threatening even this progress.In Australia, economic activity contracted substantially in the early months of the pandemic and has since recovered some of that decline. The 7 per cent contraction in GDP in the June quarter was the largest peacetime contraction since at least the 1930s, and certainly one of the most sudden. It was nonetheless not as big a fall as had been feared, and was less than that experienced in many other countries. The less negative outcome stemmed largely from Australia's early success in bringing new infection rates down, which allowed restrictions on activity to be eased sooner than earlier thought.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The COVID-19 pandemic represents the largest shock to the global economy in many decades. Labour markets have been severely disrupted. While infection rates have declined in some countries, they have escalated in many others, including the United States and some large emerging market economies. Renewed outbreaks are also occurring in some other countries, including Japan and parts of Australia. The ongoing spread of the virus, and the responses to contain it, will combine to slow the recovery.The Australian economy has experienced a severe contraction and, like many other economies, is now in the early stages of recovery. The contraction over the first half of 2020 was smaller than anticipated three months ago, though it was still very large. It was also not quite as large as in some other economies, where lockdown measures were more binding and were imposed for longer. However, the pace of recovery is expected to be slower than previously forecast. Generalised uncertainty and deficiency in demand have turned out to be more of a drag on growth than previously thought. The measures taken to address the current outbreak in Victoria will further delay the recovery. The most recently announced containment measures are expected to subtract at least 2 percentage points from national growth in the September quarter, relative to the counterfactual where the renewed outbreak had not occurred.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Combating the spread of COVID-19 has required severe restrictions on economic activity in many countries. The result has been a large and near-simultaneous contraction across the global economy. Heightened uncertainty about the future has exacerbated the contraction, both directly through weaker investment and consumer spending and via tighter financial conditions. In Australia, output is expected to contract significantly over the first half of 2020, mostly in the June quarter. While the exact size of the contraction is still uncertain, a decline in GDP of around 10 per cent from peak to trough is expected.The contractions in output in many other economies are likely to be at least as large as that in Australia; the size and timing of these declines depend both on the duration of the containment measures and on how stringent these measures have needed to be. March quarter GDP data for a number of economies show significant contractions, even though in many cases the lockdowns only began in the last few weeks of the quarter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Monetary policy was eased in 2019 to support employment and income growth and to provide greater confidence that inflation will be consistent with the medium-term target. This policy response is supporting the overall growth outlook through a number of channels. The Australian dollar is lower than it otherwise would be as a result of the policy easing; it is now around the bottom of its range in recent years. Interest rates faced by both borrowers and lenders are now at very low levels. The lower interest rates have contributed to increased demand for both new and existing homes. They also lower required debt payments for many households. The resulting extra cash flows can be spent or used to pay down debt faster, although this benefit is partly offset by reduced interest income for savers. The effects of the recent rate reductions take time to work their way through the economy and have their full impact on spending. Some of the early stage channels of policy transmission, such as new borrowing, higher asset prices and a depreciation of the exchange rate, are nonetheless proceeding as normal.The low level of interest rates in Australia reflect the low interest rates globally as well as the only gradual progress towards the Bank's goals, as the Australian economy navigates a period of slow growth. This soft patch in growth is likely to extend into early 2020 because of the ongoing drought, the effects of the bushfires, and the effects on Australian exports of the recent outbreak of a new coronavirus in China. Beyond these shorter-term effects, the medium-term outlook for the Australian economy is broadly unchanged from three months ago.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The Australian economy is gradually coming out of a soft patch. GDP growth has been recovering since its low point last year; it picked up a little in the first half of 2019 and moderate growth is expected over the remainder of the year. Growth is expected to reach 2_ per cent over 2020 and around 3 per cent by the end of 2021. This outlook is largely unchanged from three months ago, and is supported by the low level of interest rates, recent tax cuts, ongoing spending on infrastructure, the upswing in housing prices in some markets and a brighter outlook for the resources sector.The labour market has been resilient to this period of slow growth. In particular, employment has continued to expand noticeably faster than growth in the working-age population. Labour supply has increased to meet rising demand, with the participation rate at record highs in recent months. The unemployment rate has been broadly steady at around 5_ per cent for some months. It is expected to decline only gradually over the next couple of years, to a little below 5 per cent. At this level, the unemployment rate will still be somewhat short of the central estimate of the rate consistent with full employment, of around 4_ per cent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The Australian economy has been navigating a period of slow growth, with subdued growth in household income weighing on consumption spending. In contrast, employment growth has been strong. The response of labour supply has been even stronger, taking the participation rate to a record level. Despite the strong employment growth, the unemployment rate has increased to 5.2 per cent, where it has remained for three months. Domestic inflation pressures remain subdued. Housing-related inflation has been particularly soft lately, compounding the ongoing effects of spare capacity in the labour market and the resulting slow growth in labour costs.GDP growth is likely to have troughed around the middle of this year and is expected to reach about 2_ per cent over 2019. It is expected to pick up gradually to 2_ per cent over 2020, and around 3 per cent over 2021, which is a little higher than previously forecast. Growth is expected to be supported by a number of factors, including lower interest rates and recent tax measures. The established housing markets in some cities are showing signs of a turnaround, which should support spending. The mining sector is also likely to support output growth; in the near term, resource exports are recovering from recent supply disruptions, while a pick-up in mining investment will boost growth further out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Growth in the Australian economy has slowed and inflation remains low. Subdued growth in household income and the adjustment in the housing market are affecting consumer spending and residential construction.

This is lower than previously forecast, reflecting the revised outlook for household consumption spending and dwelling activity. Stronger growth in exports and, further out, work on new mining investment projects are expected to support growth. Forecasts for inflation have also been revised lower. Trimmed mean inflation is expected to be around 1_ per cent over 2019 and then increase gradually to 2 per cent in 2020 and a touch above 2 per cent by early 2021. In the near term, CPI inflation is expected to run a little above the rate for trimmed mean inflation, driven by the recent increase in petrol prices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GDP growth is expected to be around 3 per cent over this year and 2_ per cent over 2020.With growth expected to be a little above trend and the unemployment rate continuing to decline, underlying inflation is expected to increase gradually, reaching 2_ per cent by the end of 2020. Lower petrol prices are expected to result in headline inflation falling to about 1_ per cent in early 2019 before rebounding to be similar to underlying inflation. Forecasts for underlying inflation have been revised slightly lower, reflecting somewhat lower growth and expected near-term weakness in administered and utilities price inflation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The Australian economy is performing well, and a little stronger than earlier expected. GDP growth is running above 3 per cent. The unemployment rate has declined noticeably, reaching 5 per cent in the month of September. As flagged three months ago, inflation declined in the September quarter, largely because childcare prices fell and utilities price inflation moderated. More generally, inflation remains low and stable. Stronger growth and labour market conditions can be expected to generate a gradual lift in wages growth and inflation over time. The Bank's forecasts for growth and inflation have been upgraded slightly in light of recent data. GDP growth is now expected to be around 3_ per cent on average over 2018 and 2019, but to ease in the latter part of the forecast period as production of some resource commodities stabilises at high levels. Headline and underlying inflation are both expected to rise to be a little above 2_ per cent by the end of 2020.The global economic outlook remains positive. Although growth has slowed in some economies, it remains above trend in the major advanced economies. Spare capacity in these economies is likely to diminish further, putting upward pressure on global inflation. Rising trade tensions are expected to weigh a little on growth in the United States and a few economies in east Asia, but the US fiscal stimulus and still-accommodative monetary policy remain supportive of continued economic expansion. Growth in Australia's major trading partners is expected to slow slightly over the next couple of years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The Australian economy remains on track to achieve lower unemployment and higher inflation over time. Supported by accommodative domestic monetary policy and a positive international outlook, GDP growth is expected to be a little above 3 per cent in both 2018 and 2019, which will reduce spare capacity. The unemployment rate is therefore forecast to decline, reaching around 5 per cent by end 2020. As the labour market tightens, wages growth and inflation should increase gradually. Temporary factors affecting administered prices are likely to hold inflation down in the very near term. Beyond the next quarter or so, the inflation outlook is essentially unchanged from three months ago.The global economic outlook remains positive, despite the recent increase in trade tensions. Output growth has been quite strong in a number of key trading partners in the June quarter. Global growth is expected to slow a little, but remain above trend, over coming years. At present, central banks in the major advanced economies are at different stages of their monetary policy cycles, with some reducing policy accommodation and others adding to it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Domestically, a further gradual reduction in the unemployment rate and a rise in inflation are expected over the next couple of years. The Bank's forecasts are little changed from three months ago, as are the considerations for monetary policy.The global economy has been expanding at a solid pace. Data available so far imply that this continued into the March quarter, including in parts of east Asia where some indicators had suggested that growth slowed late last year. In the major advanced economies, employment growth remains strong, wages growth has picked up and the outlook for investment is positive. Both the euro area and Japan are likely to expand at or above the rate of growth of productive capacity in the period ahead, as has been the case for several years. In the United States growth is likely to be boosted by a considerable fiscal stimulus in 2018 and 2019.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This upswing has been most pronounced in manufacturing and industrial activity, and has been more synchronised across economies than has been the case for some time. GDP growth is above estimates of potential in a number of economies and labour markets have tightened further. Although commodity prices have generally risen, broader inflationary pressures have been slow to emerge.The Chinese economy continued to grow solidly over 2017. Government policies to reduce pollution, dampen housing speculation and contain financial risk are likely to constrain output growth somewhat, with conditions in China's industrial sector already having softened in recent months. Financial conditions continue to be supportive overall, and China is benefiting from the global upswing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The Australian economy is expected to expand at a solid pace over the next couple of years, and labour market developments have been quite positive of late. The drag on growth from the end of the mining investment boom has eased and is likely to end sometime in the next year or so. Investment in the non-mining sector has been increasing but growth in consumption has been below average. Inflation and wage growth remain low. Both are expected to increase only gradually over time.A number of factors are serving to hold inflation down. Wage growth has remained low and strong competition in the retail sector is dampening retail inflation across a broad range of goods. Although the unemployment rate has declined and is expected to fall further, some spare capacity is likely to remain in the labour market in the period ahead. It is also likely that structural factors and the adjustment following the terms of trade boom have been working to contain wage growth. Stronger labour market conditions are nonetheless expected to lead to a pick-up in wage growth over time. Important uncertainties influencing the outlook for inflation include the questions of how much wage growth might pick up as the labour market tightens, and how quickly the resulting increase in labour costs might feed into inflation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The Australian economy is evolving broadly as expected. The Bank's forecasts are little changed from those published in the May Statement on Monetary Policy. The economy is expected to grow at an annual rate of around 3 per cent over the next couple of years, which is a bit higher than estimates of potential growth. The unemployment rate is accordingly expected to edge lower. Underlying inflation is higher than late last year; it is expected to reach around 2 per cent over the second half of 2017 and increase a little thereafter. The forecast for headline inflation has been revised a little higher, and lies between 2 and 3 per cent over much of the forecast period.The outlook continues to be supported by accommodative monetary policy and an improvement in the global economy. Recent GDP data for Australia's major trading partners have been broadly consistent with the Bank's earlier expectations. Growth in the major advanced economies has been above potential rates for some time, with recent data showing that GDP growth in the June quarter was generally a bit stronger than in the previous quarter. Stronger global activity has been especially evident in international trade, which, along with accommodative policies, has supported growth in much of the Asian region. More recently, business investment growth has picked up in a number of economies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The Bank has been expecting for some time that inflation will increase gradually over the period ahead, to be above 2 per cent. Recent data have been consistent with this expectation. Headline inflation in the March quarter was a little above 2 per cent and is now expected to be between 2 and 3 per cent throughout the forecast period. Underlying inflation increased in the March quarter, to around 1_ per cent. It is expected to increase further, to be around 2 per cent in early 2018. These forecasts are little changed from the previous Statement on Monetary Policy.A number of other factors have afforded increased confidence in the central forecast that inflation will increase gradually. The December quarter national accounts confirmed that the period of weakness in the middle of 2016 was only temporary. The stronger near-term global outlook now seems fairly well in train and the terms of trade have held up for a bit longer than earlier expected, which will provide a boost to national incomes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The global economy entered 2017 with more momentum than earlier expected. Along with various survey indicators pointing to improved sentiment, growth in global industrial production and merchandise trade have picked up. Partly reflecting the run of recent data, the outlook for GDP growth in Australia's major trading partners has improved. GDP growth in China has been stronger than earlier anticipated, supported by accommodative macroeconomic policies, although growth is still expected to slow over coming years and the credit-based financing of some of the expansion poses risks. The largely policy-induced rebound in residential investment in China has spurred stronger demand for construction-related materials, such as steel, which in turn has boosted demand for iron ore and coal. High and rising debt, combined with excess capacity in some sectors, remains a risk to the medium-term outlook for growth in China. Growth in the major advanced economies is expected to be above potential, although there is significant uncertainty around policy in the United States and its effect on global growth and prices.Global inflationary pressures are somewhat stronger than they have been for some time, because of accommodative policy settings, the recent increases in commodity prices and limited spare capacity in a number of advanced economies. Reflecting this, sovereign bond yields have risen (though only back to levels of a year ago), the Federal Open Market Committee raised the federal funds rate, and there is no longer an expectation of further monetary easing in the other major advanced economies. The adjustments in global financial market prices have been orderly and measures of market volatility remain low.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Growth in Australia's major trading partners remains a bit below average and is expected to decline a little over the forecast period, reflecting a further moderate easing in growth in China. While longer-term risks associated with high and rising debt in China remain, the downside risks to Chinese growth in the near term appear to have diminished, in large part due to strong growth of government-funded infrastructure projects and buoyant conditions in the property market. These developments have led to an increase in the demand for bulk commodities at the same time as the Chinese authorities have restricted domestic production of commodities to reduce overcapacity. This has contributed to a pick-up in bulk commodity prices and has been associated with a broad-based increase in producer prices in China.The rise in commodity prices this year has resulted in an increase in Australia's terms of trade. This represents a marked change from the pattern of recent years, whereby the terms of trade had fallen significantly and by more than expected. Although the recent increase in the terms of trade has been associated with an appreciation of the Australian dollar, it is expected to provide some support to income growth, in contrast to the period since the peak in the terms of trade in 2011. The forecasts assume that the terms of trade will remain above the low point reached earlier this year. In part, this reflects the expectation that Chinese demand for steel will remain resilient in the near term and that Chinese production of bulk commodities will not increase substantially. However, the Chinese authorities may relax efforts to reduce overcapacity in their mining industry, in response to recent sharp increases in bulk commodity prices, and there is uncertainty about the extent to which the recovery in the Chinese property market will be sustained. Either of these factors, among other things, could affect the outlook for Australia's terms of trade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Growth in economic activity in Australia's major trading partners has remained a little below average over the first half of 2016. Despite this, commodity prices overall have increased since the beginning of the year, partly because of reductions in supply by some high-cost producers of commodities, including iron ore and coal. The outlook for overall growth in Australia's major trading partners and the outlook for the terms of trade are little changed from three months ago. The terms of trade are forecast to remain close to current levels over the next couple of years. This is around 35 per cent lower than their peak in late 2011, but still well above levels that prevailed prior to the mining boom.In China, subdued growth in private sector investment has been only partially offset by additional policy measures to support demand. Conditions in the Chinese residential property market have eased a little recently, while growth in the services sector has remained relatively strong. The effects of the gradual easing in economic growth in China have been evident in a number of east Asian economies and emerging economies in other regions that have strong trade links to China. The outlook for the Chinese economy remains an important source of uncertainty for global growth and demand for commodities. A substantial slowing in demand in the Chinese property market would pose risks for property developers and related industries, including the steel industry. There is also uncertainty related to how the Chinese authorities will respond to the difficult trade-off involved in supporting growth and avoiding financial disruption in the near term, while achieving more financial discipline and broader reforms over the longer term.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Economic conditions in Australia's major trading partners generally appear to have eased a little of late. Growth in China moderated further in the March quarter. Subdued investment growth in the manufacturing sector was partly offset by rising public infrastructure investment and a return to growth in real estate investment. The latter was consistent with a strengthening in the property market in recent months in response to a range of earlier measures to stimulate demand. The moderation of Chinese growth has affected Asian economies and emerging economies in other regions that have strong trade links with China. Economic activity remained weak in Japan, while growth eased in the United States but continued at an above-trend rate in the euro area. Meanwhile, there have been further improvements in labour market conditions across all three economies. Despite that, inflation in the major advanced economies remains below central banks' targets and inflation expectations have declined. This has been an important concern for central banks and contributed to the European Central Bank's decision to ease monetary policy further in March. Monetary policy settings remain very accommodative in Japan and the United States (where markets expect no further increase in the policy rate before late 2016).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Globally, monetary policy remains very accommodative and is supporting economic activity, although inflation remains below most central banks' targets. The US Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate target in December for the first time in nearly 10 years, although the stance of policy in the United States remains very accommodative and the pace of future rate increases is expected to be very gradual. In December, the European Central Bank (ECB) announced a package of measures designed to ease monetary policy further. More recently, the Bank of Japan also eased policy further by reducing the rate it pays on marginal reserves to _10 basis points while announcing that it would continue to expand its balance sheet over 2016 as planned.The diverging monetary policy trends among the major central banks, concerns about the challenges facing the Chinese authorities and large declines in oil prices have contributed to an increase in volatility in global financial markets of late. Sovereign bond yields have declined noticeably since late last year, as have equity prices. Also, spreads on corporate bonds in the United States, euro area and Australia increased owing to sharp rises in spreads for energy and resource-related companies. Large flows associated with capital outflows from China, together with asset sales by sovereign wealth funds of oil-producing nations, also appear to have contributed to market volatility. Despite this volatility, high-quality borrowers still have access to finance at very favourable rates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Over the course of this year, the recoveries in the United States and euro area economies have continued but growth has slowed in the Asian region. The slowdown in the Asian region has been associated with lower growth of global trade volumes and industrial production and has contributed to a decline in the prices of Australia's resource exports. Core inflation has generally been steady in both the advanced and emerging economies, but at rates below central banks' targets. Globally, monetary policy remains very accommodative and finance remains readily available to creditworthy borrowers.Chinese economic growth has eased over 2015, with weakness in construction contributing to a slowdown in the industrial sector. Although residential property prices have risen a little in recent months, sales have retraced some of the rise seen earlier in the year and real estate investment remains weak. In contrast, the pace of growth in consumption and in the output of the services sector has been maintained over 2015. Growth in infrastructure investment has moderated but remains high, supported by a pick-up in project approvals. The authorities have adjusted a number of policies to support demand, including a further easing of monetary policy in recent months.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"As has been the case for some years now, growth of Australia's major trading partners remains close to its long-run average, notwithstanding a slight easing in the June quarter. Growth of global industrial production has moderated over the past year or so, which has contributed to lower commodity prices, although the strength of commodity supply has also been a significant factor. In most of Australia's trading partners, core inflation has been stable in year-ended terms over recent months at rates below central bank targets. Globally, monetary conditions remain very accommodative and finance remains readily available to creditworthy borrowers.In China, GDP growth picked up in the June quarter, remaining at 7 per cent in year-ended terms, which is the government's target for this year. However, a range of indicators suggest that growth of consumption and industrial production, including steel production, moderated in the first half of 2015. Low inflation has given the authorities scope to adopt more accommodative monetary and fiscal policy settings. Conditions in residential property markets have improved in some respects, although this has yet to translate into a pick-up in residential property investment outside the largest cities. The recent volatility in Chinese equity markets is unlikely to have a significant direct effect on consumption, given the relatively limited exposure of households to equities. Growth in the rest of east Asia (excluding Japan) was a little below average in the first half of 2015, owing to some weakness in domestic and external demand. Meanwhile, output in advanced economies has generally been increasing at a moderate pace and labour market conditions have been improving, supported by expansionary monetary policy. In Japan, the relatively tight labour market conditions have resulted in wage growth being higher than it was a year ago. The US economy returned to moderate growth in the June quarter, following temporary weakness earlier in the year. Although the Federal Reserve is widely expected to start raising interest rates later this year, monetary conditions will remain very accommodative for some time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Growth of Australia's major trading partners was around its long-run average in 2014. It appears to have eased slightly in the early months of 2015. Commodity prices have been quite volatile over recent months, notably iron ore and oil prices, which have rebounded somewhat from recent lows. Even so, prices of Australia's key commodity exports overall have declined since the beginning of 2015 and are well down on levels of a year ago. In large part, the declines reflect growth in the supply of commodities globally, although an easing of growth in China's demand for some key commodities has also played a role. While there has been a further fall in Australia's terms of trade, the Australian dollar has appreciated by around 3 per cent against the US dollar and in trade-weighted terms since the previous Statement.In China, economic growth has eased further. The Chinese property market remains a source of weakness in the economy and this is flowing through to weaker demand for steel and other construction-related products. Indicators for Japanese economic activity have been somewhat mixed early this year, though labour market conditions remain tight and there are tentative signs that wage growth will rise, which is expected to underpin a pick-up in domestic price pressures. Economic growth in the rest of east Asia looks to have slowed a little in the March quarter. Growth in the US economy moderated in the March quarter, largely reflecting the temporary effects of disruptions related to severe weather and industrial action in West Coast ports. Meanwhile, the US labour market has continued to improve and wage growth has picked up. Economic activity in the euro area is recovering at a gradual pace.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Growth of Australia's major trading partners (MTPs) was around its long-run average in 2014. The US economy continued to strengthen, growing above its trend pace over the second half of 2014. In China, economic growth eased a little but was still very close to the authorities' target for 2014. Growth of investment and industrial production in China _ which contribute significantly to the demand for commodities, including iron ore _ have moderated over the past year or so, partly because of weak conditions in the residential property market. In Japan, economic activity has been weaker than expected since the increase in the consumption tax in April last year, but growth looks to have resumed in the December quarter. In the rest of east Asia, the pace of growth slowed a little over 2014. Economic activity in the euro area remains subdued.Australia's MTP growth is expected to continue at around its pace of recent years in 2015 as a number of effects offset each other. Growth in China is expected to be a little lower in 2015, while growth in the US economy is expected to pick up further. The significant fall in oil prices, which has largely reflected an increase in global production, represents a sizeable positive supply shock for the global economy and is expected to provide a stimulus to growth for Australia's MTPs. The fall in oil prices is also putting downward pressure on global prices of goods and services. Other commodity prices have also declined in the past three months, though by much less than oil prices. This includes iron ore and, to a lesser extent, base metals prices. Prices of Australia's liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports are generally linked to the price of oil and are expected to fall in the period ahead. The Australian terms of trade are expected to be lower as a result of these price developments, notwithstanding the benefit from the lower price of oil, of which Australia is a net importer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Over the past year, growth of Australia's major trading partners (MTPs) has been around its historical average. In China, GDP growth eased marginally over the year to the September quarter, with weakness in the property sector weighing on growth of industrial production, which has slowed a little. Nevertheless, overall growth remains consistent with the authorities' target of 7.5 per cent for this year. In Japan, activity looks to have increased modestly following the sharp decline in output after the consumption tax increase in April. In the rest of east Asia, over the past two quarters output looks to have grown at around its average pace of recent years, while the US economy has grown at an above-trend pace over the same period. Meanwhile, the recovery in the euro area remains fragile, with activity growing only very modestly in recent months. Inflation has been low in all major regions of the world and global financial conditions remain very accommodative.With global economic conditions not changing much over recent months, the outlook is still for Australia's MTP growth to be a little above its long-run average in 2014 and 2015. Growth in China is expected to trend gradually lower, one reason being that policymakers may be willing to accept some easing in growth in order to place financing on a sounder footing. GDP growth in Japan, the rest of east Asia and the euro area is expected to be around their averages of the past decade, which are quite a bit slower than their longer-term averages. Growth in the US economy is expected to continue at an above-trend pace.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Growth of Australia's major trading partners over the past year has been a little above its historical average. In the June quarter, the pace of growth looks to have eased a little with a decline in Japan's output following the increase in the consumption tax in April. At the same time, however, growth of Chinese economic activity has picked up, driven by a rebound in exports and a pick-up in investment. This improvement in economic conditions reflects, in part, the modest stimulus provided by the Chinese authorities, which is designed to achieve their target of 7.5 per cent GDP growth in 2014. The US economy grew strongly in the June quarter (after adverse weather contributed to weakness earlier in the year) and the gradual recovery of economic activity in the euro area appears to be continuing. Inflation remains low in most countries, but has picked up in Japan and has shown some signs of lifting in the United States and in parts of Asia. Globally, financial conditions remain very accommodative.Australia's trading partner growth is forecast to be a little above its long-run average in 2014 and 2015. The slight strengthening in growth compared with recent years reflects the expectation of stronger growth in the advanced economies as well as the growing share of Australian exports destined for China, an economy that is growing much faster than Australia's other trading partners. In China, GDP growth is expected to be close to the authorities' target in 2014 and then slow gradually thereafter. In Japan, abstracting from the volatility through the year induced by the consumption tax increase, growth is expected to be a bit above the average of the past decade in 2014, but then ease a little next year. Growth in the rest of east Asia is expected to strengthen a little in 2015, aided by continued recovery in the advanced economies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Growth of Australia's major trading partners looks to have moderated a little in the March quarter, but indicators are consistent with the pace of growth remaining around average this year. There are some signs that the recent slowing in China may be temporary and the Chinese authorities have indicated a willingness to support investment growth, if needed, to achieve their target for output growth. In Japan, economic activity appears to have picked up as expected in the March quarter, ahead of the increase in the consumption tax in April, and this has been followed by a decline in some measures of activity. It remains to be seen whether the planned fiscal stimulus measures will be sufficient to offset the anticipated decline in household expenditure.

The US economy is showing signs of moderate growth, notwithstanding a slowdown in the early part of the year attributable, in large part, to adverse weather. Global inflation remains low, particularly in the advanced economies, while monetary policy is highly accommodative in most economies.Growth of Australia's major trading partners looks to have moderated a little in the March quarter, but indicators are consistent with the pace of growth remaining around average this year. There are some signs that the recent slowing in China may be temporary and the Chinese authorities have indicated a willingness to support investment growth, if needed, to achieve their target for output growth. In Japan, economic activity appears to have picked up as expected in the March quarter, ahead of the increase in the consumption tax in April, and this has been followed by a decline in some measures of activity. It remains to be seen whether the planned fiscal stimulus measures will be sufficient to offset the anticipated decline in household expenditure.

Economic growth in China remained a little above the government's target of 7.5 per cent for 2013, supported by consumption and investment. In Japan, economic conditions showed further improvement towards the end of last year, consistent with expansionary fiscal and monetary policy and the associated depreciation of the yen. In the rest of east Asia, growth over recent quarters appears to have been close to its average of the past decade and was broad based across consumption, investment and exports. There are signs that economic growth in India has improved somewhat, and inflation has eased a little but remains high. The recovery in the US economy strengthened through the second half of 2013, driven by private demand, and the labour market continued to improve. The recent agreement on the budget implies a smaller contraction in public demand than was scheduled to occur. In the euro area, there are tentative signs of a gradual recovery. Inflation in the major economies remains low, although it has increased in Japan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"In recent months, growth in Australia's major trading partners appears to have remained at around its long-term average rate. The pace of growth in China has increased a little through the year and is consistent with the Chinese Government's target of 7_ per cent. The expansion in activity has been driven by domestic demand. In Japan, following the adoption of more expansionary fiscal and monetary policies late last year, the economy looks to have picked up further in the second half of this year. In the rest of east Asia, growth has continued at around its decade-average pace, while conditions remain fairly subdued in India. The US economy appears to have been growing at a moderate pace; the partial shutdown of the US federal government in the first half of October is expected to have had only a minor effect on activity. The economy in the euro area remains weak but has shown some signs of improvement. Globally, inflation pressures are contained and monetary conditions remain highly accommodative in most economies.Overall, the outlook for the global economy is much as it was a few months ago and so the forecast for growth in Australia's major trading partners in both 2013 and 2014 is little changed from the August Statement. Trading partner growth in 2013 is expected to be slightly below its longer-run average, reflecting a short period of slower growth around the beginning of the year. Growth in 2014 is expected to be a little above average. The prospect of a pick-up in conditions in many advanced economies is likely to see growth for the world as a whole improve from a below-average pace in 2013 to around average in 2014.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Overall, global economic growth appears to have been close to average in recent months, having been a bit below average earlier in the year. The Chinese economy has been growing at around the same pace as seen earlier in the year, which on an annualised basis is a bit below the authorities' stated target of 7.5 per cent. Growth of total financing in China, which was very strong earlier in the year, looks to have slowed amid authorities' concerns about the strength of non-bank financing. In Japan, the adoption of more expansionary monetary and fiscal policies has seen the exchange rate depreciate significantly since the end of last year and has supported strong growth of the economy this year. In the rest of east Asia, weaker external demand is weighing on growth but domestic demand has remained relatively resilient. The US economic recovery is proceeding at a moderate pace, notwithstanding the effects of fiscal consolidation. In contrast, economic activity remains weak in the euro area. Globally, inflation pressures have eased over the past year and monetary policy has remained highly accommodative in most economies.The outlook for the global economy is a little softer than at the time of the May Statement. World GDP growth is expected to remain close to average over the rest of this year, but with annual average growth around 3 per cent for 2013 reflecting weaker growth around the turn of the year. Growth is then expected to pick up, to be slightly above average in 2014. Economic growth is expected to be stronger for Australia's major trading partners than for the world as a whole. The slightly weaker outlook than a few months ago reflects, among other things, the assessment that growth in China is now unlikely to pick up much, if at all, in coming quarters. Rather, it is expected to remain at a pace that is close to the official target.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Moderate growth in the global economy has continued, though indicators have been somewhat mixed in recent months. Growth in the Chinese economy was a bit slower in the March quarter, but over the past year or so has been in line with the Chinese authorities' stated target. Infrastructure investment and demand for residential property continue to be important drivers of growth. In Japan, there is increased optimism regarding the outlook for the economy following fiscal and monetary policy initiatives, with measures of sentiment and forward-looking indicators of activity improving in early 2013. Elsewhere in east Asia, growth has generally eased a little in recent months following a noticeable pick-up in the December quarter. The US economy continues to grow at a moderate rate, notwithstanding the ongoing effects of fiscal consolidation. Information available to date suggests that the gradual improvement in US economic activity has not stalled following the cuts to public expenditure that came into force in early March. The euro area remains in recession and the unemployment rate across the region is high. The weak state of some key private sector balance sheets and government finances will weigh on activity in the euro area for some time and leave economies vulnerable to further adverse shocks. In recent months, there has been a decline in inflation in most regions of the world. Monetary policy settings globally are very accommodative.The outlook for global economic activity is little changed. World GDP is expected to grow at a bit over 3_ per cent in 2013, slightly below its long-run average, before picking up to 4 per cent in 2014. Growth in China is expected to remain around the rates seen in the second half of last year and provide a measure of support to activity in east Asia. The outlook in Japan has improved, while other advanced economies are expected to experience only a gradual improvement in economic conditions. Growth of Australia's major trading partners is expected to continue to exceed that of the world, reflecting the faster growth of Australia's trading partners in Asia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Global economic developments have, on balance, been more positive in recent months after economic conditions weakened earlier in 2012. There have been further signs that the Chinese economy has stabilised, underpinned by public spending and accommodative financial policies. This has provided some additional support for commodity prices and activity in east Asia, outside of Japan. In Japan, the new government has announced plans to boost domestic economic activity and combat deflation. In the United States, the full extent of the large fiscal consolidation that had been legislated to commence at the beginning of 2013 has been avoided, although decisions on spending measures and the debt ceiling were only postponed for a short while. These developments, together with earlier policy measures in the euro area, provided a boost to financial markets and have lessened some of the downside risks to global growth. At the same time, growth in most advanced economies remains subdued, unemployment rates are elevated, and these economies are likely to continue to face headwinds for some time to come; Europe, in particular, is likely to remain a potential source of instability for a while yet.World GDP is expected to grow at around 3_ per cent in 2013, before picking up to around 4 per cent in 2014. Growth in the US economy is likely to return to a long-run average pace and activity in the euro area is expected to stabilise over the next few quarters before picking up modestly. While, overall, the large advanced economies are forecast to experience only moderate growth in the near term, relatively strong growth in the fast-growing (and increasingly large) Asian economies is expected to make a substantial contribution to global demand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Following weaker global economic conditions through the middle of the year, the recent economic data have generally been a little more positive. In the United States, growth is continuing at a moderate pace and there are now signs that growth may have stabilised in China, helped by a pick-up in infrastructure investment. In Europe, although economic activity across the region remains weak, reflecting in part the impact of fiscal consolidation, recent policy announcements have helped to stabilise financial conditions. Economic activity in east Asia has been weighed down by slower growth of global trade and consequently monetary and fiscal policies have been eased a little in some countries in the region.World GDP growth is currently expected to be around 3_ per cent in 2012 and to pick up gradually to 3_ per cent in 2013, which is around the long-run average. A modest recovery in the euro area during next year and a continuation of moderate US growth are expected to help boost growth in the east Asian economies to around its trend pace. This is likely to be supported by a gradual pick-up in growth in China in response to the earlier easing in financial conditions and a further modest easing in fiscal policy. While conditions are expected to improve gradually across the globe, activity in the euro area and the United States is expected to remain below potential for some time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Global economic growth slowed a little in recent months after picking up in early 2012. Concerns about the fiscal and banking problems facing the euro area continue to weigh on the global economic outlook and have led to considerable volatility in financial markets. The flow of data over recent months suggests that economic activity contracted further in Europe. The US economy is expected to continue to experience only modest growth. Below-trend growth in Europe and the United States appears to be dampening growth in much of Asia, although in China there are signs that economic growth may have stabilised at a more sustainable pace of 7_8 per cent. Policymakers in a number of jurisdictions have responded to concerns about the outlook for economic growth and a moderation in inflation by easing monetary conditions further over recent months.These developments, and the flow of data since the May Statement, have led to small downward revisions to forecasts of growth for most economies around the world, so that expectations are for global growth to be close to average in 2012, at around 3_ per cent, before picking up to about 4 per cent in 2013. The increasing importance of the fastergrowing emerging market economies, particularly in Asia, is helping to drive global growth, while in the advanced economies, fiscal consolidation and the ongoing effects of deleveraging by the private sector are likely to be a drag on growth for some time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Global economic growth slowed late in 2011, but that has not developed into a major downturn and a number of indicators suggest that, outside of Europe, conditions have stabilised over recent months. The US economy has continued to expand at a moderate pace over the year to date and there are tentative signs that activity in east Asia is continuing to pick up after the effects of the natural disasters of 2011. Growth has slowed to a more sustainable pace in China, largely reflecting the effect of tighter domestic policies, which has helped to ease inflationary pressures. Nonetheless, the Chinese economy still grew by about 8 per cent over the year to March.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The global outlook remains clouded by the sovereign debt problems in Europe. Notwithstanding this, there has been a general improvement in sentiment over the past month or so following further measures by the European Central Bank and European governments. Equity and commodity prices have picked up after earlier falls, and bond yields in a number of European countries have declined. Nonetheless, further measures by European policymakers will be required over the months ahead for public finances in a number of countries to be placed on a sustainable path.Largely reflecting developments in Europe, official forecasts for global growth have been revised lower, with growth in the world economy now expected to be below trend in 2012, but nothing like as weak as 2008_09. As has been the case over recent years, a significant share of overall growth is expected to come from the emerging market economies, particularly those in Asia. In contrast, in many of the advanced economies a broadly synchronised fiscal consolidation is taking place at a time when both households and financial institutions are also deleveraging, which is likely to be contractionary for growth. As a result, limited progress is expected over the next couple of years in reducing unemployment in these countries.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Over recent months the sovereign debt and banking problems in Europe have again taken centre stage. These problems have led to high levels of volatility in financial markets and an increased focus on the downside risks to global growth. While the recent announcements by European leaders initially led to some improvement in confidence, difficult decisions still lie ahead, with many European governments facing a major challenge in putting their public finances on a sounder footing. The governments in the United States and Japan also face major medium-term fiscal challenges.These fiscal issues, together with the ongoing consolidation of private-sector balance sheets following the financial crisis, mean that the outlook for growth in many advanced economies remains subdued. Recent data in the United States, however, have been more positive than earlier in the year and are consistent with an economy that is experiencing a modest expansion, but with little inroad being made into the high level of unemployment. While the market turbulence has dented business and consumer confidence in the advanced economies, fears of a major downturn have not been borne out so far. At this stage, there are few signs of the widespread deferral of capital spending and disruptions to trade finance that caused so much damage to the world economy in 2008/09.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The global economy grew at an above-trend pace in 2010 and a continuation of strong growth is expected over the next couple of years, albeit with some moderation in the pace. There are, however, large differences in the amount of spare capacity across economies. In many advanced economies, output remains around, or below, pre-crisis levels and unemployment rates are still very high. In contrast, most emerging market economies have experienced very strong recoveries and spare capacity is limited.In Asia, growth looks to have picked up again recently, after softening in the middle of 2010. The Chinese economy is growing strongly and this is benefiting other economies in the region, with international trade and industrial production recording significant increases in the final months of 2010. Across the region, inflation rates have picked up, with food prices in particular rising strongly. In response, policy interest rates have been increased in most countries, although real interest rates generally remain quite low. Authorities have also taken measures to slow credit growth and short-term capital inflows, which are putting upward pressure on exchange rates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The recovery in the global economy is continuing, although conditions clearly differ across regions. Growth remains solid in most of Asia, although below the rapid pace seen earlier this year. Strong growth is also continuing in parts of Latin America. In contrast, in many of the advanced economies, consumption remains subdued and the earlier boost to activity from the dynamics of the inventory cycle is waning, as are the effects of the earlier fiscal expansions.In China and in most of east Asia, growth looks to have returned to a sustainable pace and concerns about the possibility of a larger-than-expected slowing have lessened recently. Growth also remains strong in India. In many countries in the region, the authorities have begun the process of tightening policy, although real interest rates remain low. In several countries, housing markets have been strong over the past year, which has prompted a tightening of prudential requirements and other measures to cool these markets. Inflation in the region has also increased, although this largely reflects a rise in food prices. In a number of countries, policy-makers remain concerned about the possibility of a pick-up in short-term capital inflow given the likelihood that interest rates in the advanced economies will remain low for an extended period.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The global economy has continued to recover, with growth over the past year generally exceeding earlier expectations. There are, however, signs that global growth is now moderating from its above-trend pace over the past year, and the extent of the recovery varies significantly across regions. It has been strongest in Asia, with a number of countries in the region again approaching capacity constraints. In contrast, growth in the major North Atlantic economies has been more subdued, with these economies likely to continue operating with high levels of excess capacity for some years to come.Overall, the Bank expects global growth to be around trend over the coming year, although uncertainty about the outlook remains elevated. In May and June, risk aversion rose globally as investors' concerns about the outlook for public finances in Europe and the health of the European banking system increased. Since then, risk aversion has abated somewhat reflecting a number of factors, including the establishment of new financial stability arrangements in Europe; the announcement of fiscal consolidation programs by most European governments; and the publication of the results of the stress test of the banking system. The recent economic data in Europe have also been more positive, although the outlook remains subdued. In the United States, the economy is also continuing to recover, although growth over the second half of the year is likely to be slower.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Conditions in the global economy have generally continued to improve. Forecasts for growth have been revised up again recently, with global GDP now expected to grow at trend pace, or a little above, in 2010. While the recovery is most advanced in Asia and in some other emerging economies, there are also signs that the pick-up in North America has become more broad based recently. The main area of weakness continues to be Europe, with concerns about the fiscal situation in a number of countries, particularly Greece, increasing significantly over the past month.With the recovery at different stages in different parts of the world, the nature of the challenges varies across regions. In the advanced economies, the recovery is still dependent on accommodative fiscal and monetary policies and there are very high levels of excess capacity that will remain for some time. Credit conditions also remain tight and core inflation is still trending lower. While in most countries the data over the past six months have been better than was expected a year ago, significant fiscal challenges lie ahead that are weighing on medium-term growth prospects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The global economy continues to recover following the sharp contraction in output in late 2008 and early 2009. The recovery is most advanced in Asia, although almost all economies are now growing again, albeit weakly in some cases. International trade is also continuing to recover and a degree of stability has returned to financial markets.This is a much better environment than was feared likely in the early part of last year and forecasts for global growth have been revised up accordingly. The world economy is now widely expected to grow by around 4 per cent in each of the next couple of years. This is around the average pace of growth over the past decade or so, although it would represent only a relatively mild recovery from what has been a severe global downturn. The recovery in the advanced economies is likely to remain subdued for some time, with these economies continuing to operate with considerable excess capacity. In contrast, relatively strong growth is expected in the Asian region.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The global economy is growing again after contracting sharply late last year and in the early part of 2009. There has been some recovery in world trade and most of the major economies now look to be expanding. The risk aversion that was so evident earlier in the year, particularly in financial markets, has abated and confidence is gradually returning.Asia is at the forefront of the global recovery. The region's financial systems have not experienced the same dislocation as elsewhere, and the economies are benefiting from a recovery in domestic demand, underpinned by stimulatory settings of both monetary and fiscal policy. Growth in China and India has been particularly strong.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The global economy is stabilising after contracting sharply in the December and March quarters. Over recent months, the value of international trade and global industrial production have both recorded modest gains after earlier large declines, and the extreme risk aversion seen earlier in the year has receded somewhat. Reflecting this, forecasts for world growth are being revised up for the first time in more than a year.The pick-up in economic conditions is most evident in China, where growth has been boosted by a large fiscal stimulus and increased bank lending. Elsewhere in Asia, output has retraced part of the earlier sharp falls, with a number of countries benefiting from the stronger growth in China, their own fiscal and monetary stimulus, and the absence of significant problems in their financial systems. There are fewer signs of recovery in the advanced economies, although the rate at which output is contracting has slowed noticeably. In the United States, in particular, there is tentative evidence that the economy is reaching a turning point, with the housing market showing signs of stabilisation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The world economy experienced a marked contraction in late 2008 and early 2009, with large declines in industrial production and international trade. Almost all developed countries recorded a decline in output in the December quarter, and most appear to have experienced a further decline in the March quarter. Growth also slowed significantly in all emerging market countries.The sharp and synchronised nature of the downturn is largely accounted for by the substantial falls in consumer and business confidence that followed the financial events in September 2008, including the failure of Lehman Brothers in the United States. As confidence declined and uncertainty and risk aversion increased, both consumers and businesses delayed or cancelled their spending and production plans, especially for consumer durables and capital goods. Credit conditions simultaneously tightened considerably around the world, as severe strains developed in the global financial system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Recent data point to a marked deterioration in world economic conditions in late 2008. Output contracted significantly in the December quarter in the major advanced economies as well as in a number of emerging market economies, and there were unusually sharp falls in international trade and industrial production. The Chinese economy, though still growing, also slowed significantly.The main factor behind this highly synchronised deterioration in global activity seems to have been the shock to confidence that followed the Lehman Brothers collapse in mid September. The loss of confidence was reflected in sharply declining equity and commodity prices, in survey-based measures of business and consumer sentiment around the world, and in a widespread downturn in private spending. These effects are likely to have been amplified by a cyclical slowdown in China, as well as by tighter conditions in global credit markets, including in relation to trade finance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"World financial markets have come under severe stress in the period since the last Statement. Strains in credit markets escalated in early September, and the period since then has been marked by further large declines in equity prices and exceptional volatility across a range of markets. In response to these developments, a number of governments have announced measures to strengthen their financial systems, which should help to stabilise conditions over time.The renewed turmoil was sparked by the failure or near-failure of a number of financial institutions in the United States and Europe. In the United States, the largest mortgage institutions were effectively nationalised in early September along with one of the world's major insurance companies. September also saw the demise of the large US investment banks, with one bank filing for bankruptcy, another being taken over and the remaining two announcing their conversion to commercial banks. Several large financial institutions in the United Kingdom and the euro area came under stress during this period and required government assistance. All of this is part of a major reshaping of the financial landscape, in which the business models of some of the most highly leveraged institutions have proven to be no longer viable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Inflation in Australia has remained high in the recent period against a background of tight capacity and earlier strong growth in demand. In these circumstances, the Board has been seeking to restrain demand in order to reduce inflation over time.Recent indications are that a significant moderation in domestic demand is now occurring. In addition to the effects of tighter financial conditions, other factors including a slowing in global growth, declining asset markets and higher fuel costs are acting to restrain domestic spending and activity. At the same time, high global commodity prices are adding to Australia's terms of trade, and this is providing a significant countervailing influence. Prospects for growth of the Australian economy and for inflation will continue to depend on the net effects flowing from these opposing forces.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Inflation in Australia picked up over the past year in an environment of limited spare capacity and earlier strong demand. In these circumstances, a significant slowing in the growth of demand from the rapid pace of 2007 will be needed in order to return inflation to the target over time. There are signs that such moderation is now occurring.Whether or not this more moderate pace is sustained will depend on the net effect of a range of contrasting forces likely to be affecting the economy in the period ahead. Several factors, including a slowdown in global growth, continuing strains in world financial markets and tight domestic financial conditions, are working to dampen demand. Working in the other direction, a further increase in Australia's terms of trade this year will provide a substantial stimulus to incomes and spending. Given the nature of these forces, their net effect is subject to significant uncertainty. On balance, the Board's judgment at this stage is that growth in domestic demand will remain moderate this year, and that this will help to reduce inflation over time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The Australian economy has remained robust in the recent period, notwithstanding a more difficult international environment. Domestic demand and activity have remained strong and capacity usage is high after a long period of economic expansion. These conditions have been associated with a rise in inflation. Hence Australian monetary policy has had to take into account sharply contrasting domestic and international developments.The global economic situation in recent months has been marked by ongoing turbulence in financial markets, reflected most obviously in a decline in world equity prices. The primary drivers have been the ongoing write-downs of credit exposures by major global financial institutions and increased concerns about the US and global economic outlook. Equity markets in the major industrial economies have fallen back to around their levels at the beginning of 2007, as has the Australian market. Emerging stock markets, which initially had been relatively resilient, have also experienced declines.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent quarters these conditions have been accompanied by an increase in underlying inflation.Growth of the Australian economy has for some time been assisted by strong global demand and high commodity prices. Supportive conditions appear likely to continue, though some moderation in the pace of global expansion is now occurring, partly as a result of recent strains in financial markets. In the United States, the sharp downturn in the housing sector is weighing on growth, and may do so for a while longer. Nonetheless, other parts of the US economy have so far been resilient, with recent outcomes for aggregate output and employment remaining relatively strong. The Japanese and euro area economies have been slowing recently, though moderate growth appears to be continuing. In contrast, the major developing countries, especially China, are growing rapidly, and indeed have strengthened further since the start of the year. The net effect of these contrasting trends is that world growth in 2008 is likely to moderate, though most official and private-sector observers still expect the pace to remain higher than average.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current expectations of official and private-sector observers are that the world economy will continue to grow at an above-average pace in both 2007 and 2008. These expectations have generally been revised upwards over recent months, with slower growth in the United States expected to be more than offset by stronger growth in China and the other major economies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Output growth has picked up and this has been accompanied by continued strength in incomes and falling unemployment. At the same time, despite high levels of capacity utilisation and tight labour market conditions, there has been some moderation in underlying inflation.These developments have taken place against a background of continued strength in the global economy. Most expectations are that growth of the world economy this year will again be above average, though a little below last year's pace. The US economy is now in a period of more moderate growth, with activity being dampened by a downturn in the housing sector. There remain uncertainties over the US outlook, particularly relating to developments in the sub-prime mortgage market, but the indications to date are that the spillover from the housing downturn has been limited. In other parts of the world, conditions have generally remained strong. China's rapid growth has continued, with the pace increasing further in the March quarter.

The US economy has remained robust, and concerns that a downturn in the housing sector would significantly dampen activity have not so far been borne out. Information on other parts of the world remains consistent with expectations of strong aggregate growth. The Chinese economy has continued to expand at a double-digit rate, with recent policy measures having had some success in encouraging a shift from investment to consumer spending. In Japan, despite more moderate growth recently, improving conditions in the business sector and the labour market point to good prospects for further expansion.

While growth in the United States has moderated recently, strong economic conditions are generally prevailing in other parts of the world. Growth in the Chinese economy has remained above 10 per cent and there has been a significant improvement in conditions in the euro area since the beginning of the year.

The world economy is now in its fourth successive year of above-average growth, and most observers expect this to continue in the year ahead. While there have been signs of some moderation in the United States recently, this is currently being offset by stronger growth in other parts of the world. The Japanese economy is experiencing its best period of sustained expansion for some time. In China, recent indications are that the pace of growth has picked up this year from an already high rate. The performance of the smaller east Asian economies has remained solid, benefiting from the strength in China and in global electronics demand. There has also been a gradual improvement in conditions in the euro area.The strength of the global economy over recent years has been accompanied by sustained upward pressure on commodity prices. One important element of this has been the increase in crude oil prices during this period. Although events in the Middle East have recently contributed to the pressure on oil prices, their upward trend over the past few years has been mainly a consequence of strong global demand. The increases in commodity prices have been broadly based. Prices of Australia's base metals exports have increased by 40 per cent since the start of the year, following on from strong increases in each of the previous two years. In addition, contracts finalised in recent months for Australia's bulk commodity exports have provided for further rises in iron ore prices, while coal prices have fallen only modestly after their near-doubling last year. Overall, Australia's terms of trade are estimated to have increased by 6 per cent over the year to the June quarter, and by a cumulative 34 per cent since 2002.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In China and other parts of Asia the already rapid pace of growth appears to have picked up further recently. Overall, the world economy is likely to expand at a faster-than-average pace in 2006 for the fourth successive year, and most observers expect this to continue in 2007.The strong global expansion in recent years has been accompanied by sustained upward pressure on a range of international commodity prices. An important aspect of this has been the rise in world oil prices. Concerns about possible supply disruptions have at times contributed to these oil price fluctuations, but for the most part the upward trend has been a consequence of strong global demand. As a result, expectations of world growth have generally remained strong throughout the period when oil prices have been rising.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There have also been some signs of improvement recently in the euro area. Growth in world GDP is estimated to have been well above average in 2005, and most observers expect this to continue in 2006. The most recent economic indicators have tended to strengthen these expectations.Against this background central banks in the major economies, with the exception of Japan, have begun normalising official interest rates from the unusually low levels they reached in the early part of the decade. The United States is now quite advanced in this process, with the Fed funds rate back to a level generally regarded as close to normal. Central banks in other major countries are at a much earlier stage, however, and world policy rates on average remain well below normal. Long-term interest rates are also relatively low, having remained broadly steady in the face of rising official rates. The combination of strong economic growth, low inflation and low interest rates has contributed to buoyant conditions in world financial markets. Spreads on emerging market and corporate debt have narrowed, and global equity prices have increased solidly in each of the past three years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most regions of the world are experiencing good economic growth this year, with the United States and China in particular performing strongly. There has been a notable improvement in conditions in Japan, where spending by businesses and consumers has strengthened and there has been good progress in winding back the balance sheet excesses that had hampered growth in the past. Elsewhere, solid growth is being recorded in the east Asian region and in the emerging economies of Eastern Europe and Latin America, with the euro area the only significant weak spot at present. Overall the world economy is likely to record a further year of above-average growth in 2005, and most observers expect this to continue next year.A lot of attention over the past couple of years has focused on the upward trend in oil prices and its effects on the global economy. While periodic disruptions to supply have at times contributed to this trend, the main cause has been the strength of world demand. In these circumstances, higher oil prices do not appear to have had a significant contractionary effect on the world economy, and observers have not generally been scaling back their expectations of future world growth during the period when oil prices have been rising. The main macroeconomic effects to date can be seen in higher headline inflation figures around the world, most notably in the United States. As yet, there has been little evidence of any significant second-round inflationary effects, and at this stage core inflation rates in most advanced countries remain contained.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Japanese economy, although not generally a significant contributor to world growth in recent years, now seems to be performing better after some disappointing results in 2004. Growth in the rest of east Asia appears reasonably solid this year, while the main weak spot for the world economy remains the euro area. Overall, most official and private-sector forecasts are that world growth will be above average in 2005 and 2006, though below last year's pace. Higher oil prices in recent months have not generally been viewed as endangering the global expansion, but are seen mainly as a sign of continuing demand pressures.The main news in world financial markets recently was the announcement of new exchange rate arrangements for China, involving an immediate appreciation of 2 per cent against the US dollar and the move to a managed peg. While the initial appreciation was small, the new arrangements provide for greater flexibility of the exchange rate over time. This should be of benefit to China in the medium term, as it will help the authorities to gain greater control over their domestic monetary conditions, and hence to contain inflationary pressures in goods and asset markets more effectively. Most other Asian currencies rose in parallel with the Chinese currency. The Australian dollar was little affected, and remains in the same broad range it has been in since late 2004. Aside from the Chinese announcement, there were few major developments in global markets in recent months.

This has been associated with fast growth in employment over much of the year, and a significant further decline in the unemployment rate.Conditions have been particularly favourable for Australian exporters, with world economic growth at its strongest for a decade. This strength owes a good deal to the acceleration in the US economy during the first half of the year, but stronger performances in Europe, east Asia and Japan have also contributed. Most commodity prices have firmed in foreign currency terms and, along with the depreciation in the Australian dollar, have contributed to the value of exports rising by 25 per cent over the past year (abstracting from the recording of Olympic effects in the month of September).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

other,,"Monetary policy has lived under many guises. But however it may appear, it generally boils down to adjusting the supply of money in the economy to achieve some combination of inflation and output stabilization.Most economists would agree that in the long run, output¡ªusually measured by gross domestic product (GDP)¡ªis fixed, so any changes in the money supply only cause prices to change. But in the short run, because prices and wages usually do not adjust immediately, changes in the money supply can affect the actual production of goods and services. This is why monetary policy¡ªgenerally conducted by central banks such as the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) or the European Central Bank (ECB)¡ªis a meaningful policy tool for achieving both inflation and growth objectives.In a recession, for example, consumers stop spending as much as they used to; business production declines, leading firms to lay off workers and stop investing in new capacity; and foreign appetite for the country¡¯s exports may also fall. In short, there is a decline in overall, or aggregate, demand to which government can respond with a policy that leans against the direction in which the economy is headed. Monetary policy is often that countercyclical tool of choice.Such a countercyclical policy would lead to the desired expansion of output (and employment), but, because it entails an increase in the money supply, would also result in an increase in prices. As an economy gets closer to producing at full capacity, increasing demand will put pressure on input costs, including wages. Workers then use their increased income to buy more goods and services, further bidding up prices and wages and pushing generalized inflation upward¡ªan outcome policymakers usually want to avoid.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Congress has tasked the Federal Reserve with a ¡°dual mandate¡± that it pursues with monetary policy: maximize employment and maintain steady prices. In general, that means the Fed aims to keep unemployment low, but not zero, to foster productivity without inciting higher inflation.

By buying or selling government securities (usually bonds), the Fed¡ªor a central bank¡ªaffects the money supply and interest rates. If, for example, the Fed buys government securities, it pays with a check drawn on itself. This action creates money in the form of additional deposits from the sale of the securities by commercial banks. By adding to the cash reserves of the commercial banks, then, the Fed enables those banks to increase their lending capacity. Consequently, the additional demand for government bonds bids up their price and thus reduces their yield (i.e., interest rates). The purpose of this operation is to ease the availability of credit and to reduce interest rates, which thereby encourages businesses to invest more and consumers to spend more. The selling of government securities by the Fed achieves the opposite effect of contracting the money supply and increasing interest rates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This ¡®RRR, as it is often called, is a level at which banks need to keep money on reserve with the central bank in order to lend.

other,,"The Fed, as the nation¡¯s monetary policy authority, influences the availability and cost of money and credit to promote a healthy economy. Congress has given the Fed two coequal goals for monetary policy: first, maximum employment; and, second, stable prices, meaning low, stable inflation. This ¡°dual mandate¡± implies a third, lesser-known goal of moderate long-term interest rates.The Fed¡¯s interpretations of its maximum employment and stable prices goals have changed over time as the economy has evolved. For example, during the long expansion after the Great Recession of 2007_2009, labor market conditions became very strong and yet did not trigger a significant rise in inflation. Accordingly, the Fed de-emphasized its prior concern about employment possibly exceeding its maximum level, focusing instead only on shortfalls of employment below its maximum level. In this newer interpretation, formalized in the FOMC¡¯s August 2020 ¡°Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,¡± high employment and low unemployment do not raise concerns for the FOMC as long as they are not accompanied by unwanted increases in inflation or the emergence of other risks that could threaten attainment of the dual mandate goals.More generally, maximum employment is a broad-based and inclusive goal that is not directly measurable and is affected by changes in the structure and dynamics of the labor market. So, the Fed doesn¡¯t specify a fixed goal for employment. Its assessments of the shortfalls of employment from its maximum level rest on a wide range of indicators and are necessarily uncertain. Intuitively, though, when the economy is at maximum employment, anyone who wants a job can get one. And recent estimates of the longer-run rate of unemployment that is consistent with maximum employment are generally around 4 percent.Fed policymakers judge that a 2 percent inflation rate, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with its mandate for stable prices. The Fed began explicitly stating the 2 percent goal in 2012. In its 2020 ¡°Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,¡± the FOMC changed that goal to inflation that averages 2 percent over time, in contrast to aiming for 2 percent at any given time. So, following periods when inflation has persisted below 2 percent, the Fed strives for inflation to be moderately above 2 percent for some time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The original equilibrium (E0) occurs at an interest rate of 8% and a quantity of funds loaned and borrowed of $10 billion.

other,,"Congress has delegated responsibility for monetary policy to the Federal Reserve (the Fed), the nation¡¯s central bank, but retains oversight responsibilities for ensuring that the Fed is adhering to its statutory mandate of ¡°maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.¡± To meet its price stability mandate, the Fed has set a longer-run goal of 2% inflation.The Fed¡¯s control over monetary policy stems from its exclusive ability to alter the money supply and credit conditions more broadly. Normally, the Fed conducts monetary policy by setting a target for the federal funds rate, the rate at which banks borrow and lend reserves on an overnight basis. It meets its target through open market operations, financial transactions traditionally involving U.S. Treasury securities. Beginning in 2007, the federal funds target was reduced from 5.25% to a range of 0% to 0.25% in December 2008, which economists call the zero lower bound. By historical standards, rates were kept unusually low for an unusually long time to mitigate the effects of the 2007-2009 financial crisis and its aftermath. Starting in December 2015, the Fed began raising interest rates. In total, the Fed raised rates nine times between 2015 and 2018, by 0.25 percentage points each time. In light of increased economic uncertainty, the Fed then reduced interest rates by 0.25 percentage points in a series of steps beginning in July 2019.The Fed influences interest rates to affect interest-sensitive spending, such as business capital spending on plant and equipment, household spending on consumer durables, and residential investment. In addition, when interest rates diverge between countries, it causes capital flows that affect the exchange rate between foreign currencies and the dollar, which in turn affects spending on exports and imports. Through these channels, monetary policy can be used to stimulate or slow aggregate spending in the short run. In the long run, monetary policy mainly affects inflation. A low and stable rate of inflation promotes price transparency and, thereby, sounder economic decisions.The Fed¡¯s relative independence from Congress and the Administration has been justified by many economists on the grounds that it reduces political pressure to make monetary policy decisions that are inconsistent with a long-term focus on stable inflation. But independence reduces accountability to Congress and the Administration, and recent criticism of the Fed by the President has raised the question about the proper balance between the two.While the federal funds target was at the zero lower bound, the Fed attempted to provide additional stimulus through unsterilized purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities (MBS), a practice popularly referred to as quantitative easing (QE). Between 2009 and 2014, the Fed undertook three rounds of QE. The third round was completed in October 2014, at which point the Fed¡¯s balance sheet was $4.5 trillion¡ªfive times its precrisis size. After QE ended, the Fed maintained the balance sheet at the same level until September 2017, when it began to very gradually reduce it to a more normal size. The Fed has raised interest rates in the presence of a large balance sheet through the use of two new tools¡ªby paying banks interest on reserves held at the Fed and by engaging in reverse repurchase agreements (reverse repos) through a new overnight facility. In January 2019, the Fed announced that it would continue using these tools to set interest rates permanently. In August 2019, it stopped reducing the balance sheet from its current size of $3.8 trillion. However, the remaining MBS on its balance sheet would gradually be replaced with Treasury securities as they mature. In response to turmoil in the repo market in September 2019, the Fed began intervening in the repo market and began expanding its balance sheet again in October 2019.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Monetary policy affects aggregate demand and the level of economic activity by increasing or decreasing the availability of credit, which can be seen through decreasing or increasing interest rates. Recall that an open market purchase by the Fed adds reserves to the banking system. Banks turn those reserves into new loans, making credit available to more borrowers and increasing the supply of money.Consider the market for loanable bank funds, shown in Figure 1. The original equilibrium (E0) occurs at an interest rate of 8% and a quantity of funds loaned and borrowed of $10 billion. An open market purchase by the Fed will shift the supply of loanable funds to the right from the original supply curve (S0) to S1, leading to an equilibrium (E1) with a lower interest rate of 6% and a quantity of funds loaned of $14 billion. This is an example of an expansionary monetary policy.Conversely, an open market sale by the Fed reduces the amount of reserves in the banking system which requires banks to decrease their loans outstanding, reducing the availability of credit and decreasing the supply of money. This will shift the supply of loanable funds to the left from the original supply curve (S0) to S2, leading to an equilibrium (E2) with a higher interest rate of 10% and a quantity of funds loaned of $8 billion.

other,,"The Fed responded rapidly and dramatically to keep the U.S. economy from descending into depression. Monetary policymakers reduced the benchmark fed funds rate to near zero; promised to more than double the size of the Fed's balance sheet by engaging in large-scale asset purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, with the intent of reducing longer-run interest rates; and restarted or created a number of special purpose vehicles (SPVs), which are off the Fed's balance sheet, to stabilize a broad array of financial markets.[1] The U.S. Treasury has worked closely with the Fed to backstop lending and increase leverage, providing $454 billion to cover potential losses from the Fed's lending programs to private firms under the CARES Act (an acronym for Coronavirus, Aid, Relief, and Economic Security). With leverage estimated at 10 to 1, the Fed may lend as much as $4.54 trillion¡ªnone of which would show up as part of the federal deficit (see Ip and Torres).By monetizing much of the new federal debt and engaging in credit allocation, the Fed risks sacrificing monetary control and its independence. Of course, the Board of Governors could increase the rate of interest it pays on excess reserves to keep inflation at bay. However, in so doing, it would deprive the Treasury of revenue to help reduce budget deficits.The more serious issue for the Fed's credibility and independence is the drift into fiscal space. As Charles Plosser, former CEO and president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia has warned: ""Independence is drifting away and after this [Covid-19] crisis it will be easier and easier for politicians to seek Fed participation in off-budget fiscal actions.""[2]The Fed's decision to set up SPVs to purchase corporate and municipal debt opens the door for all sorts of mischief (see Timiraos). Likewise, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) now accepts more risky assets, including commercial mortgage securities and collateralized loan obligations.

If a bank is unable to meet its reserve requirement, it can borrow from the Federal Reserve to meet the requirement. The interest rate on these funds is called the discount rate. (Banks can also borrow the excess reserves of other banks, and this interest rate, called the federal funds rate, is determined by the open market. The Federal Reserve works to keep the discount rate close to the federal funds rate.)Now, let's assume that policymakers feel employment is too low and interest rates are too high. The Federal Reserve could enact expansionary monetary policy and encourage economic growth by doing one or all of these three things:

other,,"Monetary policy refers to the steps taken by a country¡¯s central bank to control the money supply for economic stability. For example, policymakers manipulate money circulation for increasing employment, GDP, price stability by using tools such as interest rates, reserves, bonds, etc.Monetary policy is the central bank¡¯s action to establish economic stability in a nation and fulfil other goals like unemployment, inflation, price instability, recession, etc.It is considered to be a corrective measure since such a policy reform is made to control the prevailing economic situation or adversity.There are two forms of monetary policy, i.e., the contractionary and expansionary policy.The tools or measures initiated by the central bank under this policy include changes in the discount rate, open market operations and reserve requirements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"A major factor in a nation's economy is its monetary policy, which determines the amount of money flowing through the economy.Set by the Federal Reserve in the United States, monetary policy influences economic activity by controlling the country's money supply and credit. The U.S. Federal Reserve can control monetary policy by altering rates of interest and changing the amount of money banks must have in their reserves. The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 officially gave the Federal Reserve power over the country's monetary policy. Since then, the importance of monetary policy has increased tremendously.When implemented correctly, monetary policy stabilizes prices and wages, which leads to an increase in jobs and long-term economic growth. U.S. monetary policy plays a significant role in not just the economy as a whole but also specific decisions consumers make, such as buying a home or a car, starting or expanding a business, and investing money.The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) determine monetary policy. The key to monetary policy is finding the perfect balance; letting the money supply grow too rapidly increases inflation, and allowing it to grow too slowly stunts economic growth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"With progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic have shown improvement but have not fully recovered. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation having run persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer_term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved. The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. Last December, the Committee indicated that it would continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage_backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward its maximum employment and price stability goals. Since then, the economy has made progress toward these goals, and the Committee will continue to assess progress in coming meetings. These asset purchases help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken forceful actions to provide support and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to households, businesses, and communities. Today I will review the current economic situation before turning to monetary policy.The path of the economy continues to depend significantly on the course of the virus and the measures undertaken to control its spread. The resurgence in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in recent months is causing great hardship for millions of Americans and is weighing on economic activity and job creation. Following a sharp rebound in economic activity last summer, momentum slowed substantially, with the weakness concentrated in the sectors most adversely affected by the resurgence of the virus. In recent weeks, the number of new cases and hospitalizations has been falling, and ongoing vaccinations offer hope for a return to more normal conditions later this year. However, the economic recovery remains uneven and far from complete, and the path ahead is highly uncertain.Household spending on services remains low, especially in sectors that typically require people to gather closely, including leisure and hospitality. In contrast, household spending on goods picked up encouragingly in January after moderating late last year. The housing sector has more than fully recovered from the downturn, while business investment and manufacturing production have also picked up. The overall recovery in economic activity since last spring is due in part to unprecedented fiscal and monetary actions, which have provided essential support to many households, businesses, and communities.As with overall economic activity, the pace of improvement in the labor market has slowed. Over the three months ending in January, employment rose at an average monthly rate of only 29,000. Continued progress in many industries has been tempered by significant losses in industries such as leisure and hospitality, where the resurgence in the virus and increased social distancing have weighed further on activity. The unemployment rate remained elevated at 6.3 percent in January, and participation in the labor market is notably below pre-pandemic levels. Although there has been much progress in the labor market since the spring, millions of Americans remain out of work. As discussed in the February Monetary Policy Report, the economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been the hardest hit. In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe for lower-wage workers and for African Americans, Hispanics, and other minority groups. The economic dislocation has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"As described in the February Monetary Policy Report, in August, the Committee unanimously adopted its revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. Our revised statement shares many features with its predecessor. For example, we have not changed our 2 percent longer-run inflation goal. However, we did make some key changes. Regarding our employment goal, we emphasize that maximum employment is a broad and inclusive goal. This change reflects our appreciation for the benefits of a strong labor market, particularly for low- and moderate-income communities. In addition, we state that our policy decisions will be informed by our ""assessments of shortfalls of employment from its maximum level"" rather than by ""deviations from its maximum level.""1 This change means that we will not tighten monetary policy solely in response to a strong labor market. Regarding our price-stability goal, we state that we will seek to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time. This means that, following periods when inflation has been running below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time. With this change, we aim to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at our 2 percent goal. Well-anchored inflation expectations enhance our ability to meet both our employment and inflation goals, particularly in the current low interest rate environment in which our main policy tool is likely to be more frequently constrained by the lower bound.We have implemented our new framework by forcefully deploying our policy tools. As noted in our January policy statement, we expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current accommodative target range of the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities at least at their current pace until substantial further progress has been made toward our goals. These purchases, and the associated increase in the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, have materially eased financial conditions and are providing substantial support to the economy. The economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved. We will continue to clearly communicate our assessment of progress toward our goals well in advance of any change in the pace of purchases.Since the onset of the pandemic, the Federal Reserve has been taking actions to support more directly the flow of credit in the economy, deploying our emergency lending powers to an unprecedented extent, enabled in large part by financial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury. Although the CARES Act (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act) facilities are no longer open to new activity, our other facilities remain in place.We understand that our actions affect households, businesses, and communities across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help ensure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The economic expansion is well into its 11th year, and it is the longest on record. Over the second half of last year, economic activity increased at a moderate pace and the labor market strengthened further, as the economy appeared resilient to the global headwinds that had intensified last summer. Inflation has been low and stable but has continued to run below the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) symmetric 2 percent objective.Job gains averaged 200,000 per month in the second half of last year, and an additional 225,000 jobs were added in January. The pace of job gains has remained above what is needed to provide jobs for new workers entering the labor force, allowing the unemployment rate to move down further over the course of last year. The unemployment rate was 3.6 percent last month and has been near half-century lows for more than a year. Job openings remain plentiful. Employers are increasingly willing to hire workers with fewer skills and train them. As a result, the benefits of a strong labor market have become more widely shared. People who live and work in low- and middle-income communities are finding new opportunities. Employment gains have been broad based across all racial and ethnic groups and levels of education. Wages have been rising, particularly for lower-paying jobs.Gross domestic product rose at a moderate rate over the second half of last year. Growth in consumer spending moderated toward the end of the year following earlier strong increases, but the fundamentals supporting household spending remain solid. Residential investment turned up in the second half, but business investment and exports were weak, largely reflecting sluggish growth abroad and trade developments. Those same factors weighed on activity at the nation's factories, whose output declined over the first half of 2019 and has been little changed, on net, since then. The February Monetary Policy Report discusses the recent weakness in manufacturing. Some of the uncertainties around trade have diminished recently, but risks to the outlook remain. In particular, we are closely monitoring the emergence of the coronavirus, which could lead to disruptions in China that spill over to the rest of the global economy.Inflation ran below the FOMC's symmetric 2 percent objective throughout 2019. Over the 12 months through December, overall inflation based on the price index for personal consumption expenditures was 1.6 percent. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was also 1.6 percent. Over the next few months, we expect inflation to move closer to 2 percent, as unusually low readings from early 2019 drop out of the 12-month calculation.The nation faces important longer-run challenges. Labor force participation by individuals in their prime working years is at its highest rate in more than a decade. However, it remains lower than in most other advanced economies, and there are troubling labor market disparities across racial and ethnic groups and across regions of the country. In addition, although it is encouraging that productivity growth, the main engine for raising wages and living standards over the longer term, has moved up recently, productivity gains have been subpar throughout this economic expansion. Finding ways to boost labor force participation and productivity growth would benefit Americans and should remain a national priority.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"I will now turn to monetary policy. Over the second half of 2019, the FOMC shifted to a more accommodative stance of monetary policy to cushion the economy from weaker global growth and trade developments and to promote a faster return of inflation to our symmetric 2 percent objective. We lowered the federal funds target range at our July, September, and October meetings, bringing the current target range to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. At our subsequent meetings, with some uncertainties surrounding trade having diminished and amid some signs that global growth may be stabilizing, the Committee left the policy rate unchanged. The FOMC believes that the current stance of monetary policy will support continued economic growth, a strong labor market, and inflation returning to the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective. As long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with this outlook, the current stance of monetary policy will likely remain appropriate. Of course, policy is not on a preset course. If developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly.Taking a longer view, there has been a decline over the past quarter-century in the level of interest rates consistent with stable prices and the economy operating at its full potential. This low interest rate environment may limit the ability of central banks to reduce policy interest rates enough to support the economy during a downturn. With this concern in mind, we have been conducting a review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices. Public engagement is at the heart of this effort. Through our Fed Listens events, we have been hearing from representatives of consumer, labor, business, community, and other groups. The February Monetary Policy Report shares some of what we have learned. The insights we have gained from these events have informed our framework discussions, as reported in the minutes of our meetings. We will share our conclusions when we finish the review, likely around the middle of the year.The current low interest rate environment also means that it would be important for fiscal policy to help support the economy if it weakens. Putting the federal budget on a sustainable path when the economy is strong would help ensure that policymakers have the space to use fiscal policy to assist in stabilizing the economy during a downturn. A more sustainable federal budget could also support the economy's growth over the long term.Finally, I will briefly review our planned technical operations to implement monetary policy. The February Monetary Policy Report provides details of our operations to date. Last October, the FOMC announced a plan to purchase Treasury bills and conduct repo operations. These actions have been successful in providing an ample supply of reserves to the banking system and effective control of the federal funds rate. As our bill purchases continue to build reserves toward levels that maintain ample conditions, we intend to gradually transition away from the active use of repo operations. Also, as reserves reach durably ample levels, we intend to slow our purchases to a pace that will allow our balance sheet to grow in line with trend demand for our liabilities. All of these technical measures support the efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy. They are not intended to represent a change in the stance of monetary policy. As always, we stand ready to adjust the details of our technical operations as conditions warrant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Beginning in mid-March, economic activity fell at an unprecedented speed in response to the outbreak of the virus and the measures taken to control its spread. Even after the unexpectedly positive May employment report, nearly 20 million jobs have been lost on net since February, and the reported unemployment rate has risen about 10 percentage points, to 13.3 percent. The decline in real gross domestic product (GDP) this quarter is likely to be the most severe on record. The burden of the downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans. Instead, those least able to withstand the downturn have been affected most. As discussed in the June Monetary Policy Report, low-income households have experienced, by far, the sharpest drop in employment, while job losses of African Americans, Hispanics, and women have been greater than that of other groups. If not contained and reversed, the downturn could further widen gaps in economic well-being that the long expansion had made some progress in closing.Recently, some indicators have pointed to a stabilization, and in some areas a modest rebound, in economic activity. With an easing of restrictions on mobility and commerce and the extension of federal loans and grants, some businesses are opening up, while stimulus checks and unemployment benefits are supporting household incomes and spending. As a result, employment moved higher in May. That said, the levels of output and employment remain far below their pre-pandemic levels, and significant uncertainty remains about the timing and strength of the recovery. Much of that economic uncertainty comes from uncertainty about the path of the disease and the effects of measures to contain it. Until the public is confident that the disease is contained, a full recovery is unlikely.Moreover, the longer the downturn lasts, the greater the potential for longer-term damage from permanent job loss and business closures. Long periods of unemployment can erode workers' skills and hurt their future job prospects. Persistent unemployment can also negate the gains made by many disadvantaged Americans during the long expansion and described to us at our Fed Listens events. The pandemic is presenting acute risks to small businesses, as discussed in the Monetary Policy Report. If a small or medium-sized business becomes insolvent because the economy recovers too slowly, we lose more than just that business. These businesses are the heart of our economy and often embody the work of generations.With weak demand and large price declines for some goods and services¡ªsuch as apparel, gasoline, air travel, and hotels¡ªconsumer price inflation has dropped noticeably in recent months. But indicators of longer-term inflation expectations have been fairly steady. As output stabilizes and the recovery moves ahead, inflation should stabilize and then gradually move back up over time closer to our symmetric 2 percent objective. Inflation is nonetheless likely to remain below our objective for some time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The Federal Reserve's response to this extraordinary period is guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system. We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy in this challenging time.In March, we quickly lowered our policy interest rate to near zero, reflecting the effects of COVID-19 on economic activity, employment, and inflation, and the heightened risks to the outlook. We expect to maintain interest rates at this level until we are confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.We have also been taking broad and forceful actions to support the flow of credit in the economy. Since March, we have been purchasing sizable quantities of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities in order to support the smooth functioning of these markets, which are vital to the flow of credit in the economy. As described in the June Monetary Policy Report, these purchases have helped restore orderly market conditions and have fostered more accommodative financial conditions. As market functioning has improved since the strains experienced in March, we have gradually reduced the pace of these purchases. To sustain smooth market functioning and thereby foster the effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions, we will increase our holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities over coming months at least at the current pace. We will closely monitor developments and are prepared to adjust our plans as appropriate to support our goals.To provide stability to the financial system and support the flow of credit to households, businesses, and state and local governments, the Federal Reserve, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, established 11 credit and liquidity facilities under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. The June Monetary Policy Report provides details on these facilities, which fall into two categories: stabilizing short-term funding markets and providing more-direct support for credit across the economy.To help stabilize short-term funding markets, the Federal Reserve set up the Commercial Paper Funding Facility and the Money Market Liquidity Facility to stem rapid outflows from prime money market funds. The Fed also established the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, which provides loans against good collateral to primary dealers that are critical intermediaries in short-term funding markets.To more directly support the flow of credit to households, businesses, and state and local governments, the Federal Reserve established a number of facilities. To support the small business sector, we established the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility to bolster the effectiveness of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act's (CARES Act) Paycheck Protection Program. Our Main Street Lending Program, which we are in the process of launching, supports lending to both small and midsized businesses. The Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility supports lending to both businesses and consumers. To support the employment and spending of investment-grade businesses, we established two corporate credit facilities. And to help U.S. state and local governments manage cash flow pressures and serve their communities, we set up the Municipal Liquidity Facility.The tools that the Federal Reserve is using under its 13(3) authority are appropriately reserved for times of emergency. When this crisis is behind us, we will put them away. The June Monetary Policy Report reviews the implications of these tools for the Federal Reserve's balance sheet.Many of these facilities have been supported by funding from the CARES Act. We will be disclosing, on a monthly basis, names and details of participants in each such facility; amounts borrowed and interest rate charged; and overall costs, revenues, and fees for each facility. We embrace our responsibility to the American people to be as transparent as possible, and we appreciate that the need for transparency is heightened when we are called upon to use our emergency powers.We recognize that our actions are only part of a broader public-sector response. Congress's passage of the CARES Act was critical in enabling the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department to establish many of the lending programs. The CARES Act and other legislation provide direct help to people, businesses, and communities. This direct support can make a critical difference not just in helping families and businesses in a time of need, but also in limiting long-lasting damage to our economy.I want to end by acknowledging the tragic events that have again put a spotlight on the pain of racial injustice in this country. The Federal Reserve serves the entire nation. We operate in, and are part of, many of the communities across the country where Americans are grappling with and expressing themselves on issues of racial equality. I speak for my colleagues throughout the Federal Reserve System when I say, there is no place at the Federal Reserve for racism and there should be no place for it in our society. Everyone deserves the opportunity to participate fully in our society and in our economy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The U.S. economy grew at a solid pace over the second half of 2017 and into this year. Monthly job gains averaged 179,000 from July through December, and payrolls rose an additional 200,000 in January. This pace of job growth was sufficient to push the unemployment rate down to 4.1 percent, about 3/4 percentage point lower than a year earlier and the lowest level since December 2000. In addition, the labor force participation rate remained roughly unchanged, on net, as it has for the past several years--that is a sign of job market strength, given that retiring baby boomers are putting downward pressure on the participation rate. Strong job gains in recent years have led to widespread reductions in unemployment across the income spectrum and for all major demographic groups. For example, the unemployment rate for adults without a high school education has fallen from about 15 percent in 2009 to 5-1/2 percent in January of this year, while the jobless rate for those with a college degree has moved down from 5 percent to 2 percent over the same period. In addition, unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanics are now at or below rates seen before the recession, although they are still significantly above the rate for whites. Wages have continued to grow moderately, with a modest acceleration in some measures, although the extent of the pickup likely has been damped in part by the weak pace of productivity growth in recent years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"I will now turn to monetary policy. The Congress has assigned us the goals of promoting maximum employment and stable prices. Over the second half of 2017, the FOMC continued to gradually reduce monetary policy accommodation. Specifically, we raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point at our December meeting, bringing the target to a range of 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent. In addition, in October we initiated a balance sheet normalization program to gradually reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings. That program has been proceeding smoothly. These interest rate and balance sheet actions reflect the Committee's view that gradually reducing monetary policy accommodation will sustain a strong labor market while fostering a return of inflation to 2 percent.In gauging the appropriate path for monetary policy over the next few years, the FOMC will continue to strike a balance between avoiding an overheated economy and bringing PCE price inflation to 2 percent on a sustained basis. While many factors shape the economic outlook, some of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds: In particular, fiscal policy has become more stimulative and foreign demand for U.S. exports is on a firmer trajectory. Despite the recent volatility, financial conditions remain accommodative. At the same time, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer-run objective. In the FOMC's view, further gradual increases in the federal funds rate will best promote attainment of both of our objectives. As always, the path of monetary policy will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.In evaluating the stance of monetary policy, the FOMC routinely consults monetary policy rules that connect prescriptions for the policy rate with variables associated with our mandated objectives. Personally, I find these rule prescriptions helpful. Careful judgments are required about the measurement of the variables used, as well as about the implications of the many issues these rules do not take into account. I would like to note that this Monetary Policy Report provides further discussion of monetary policy rules and their role in the Federal Reserve's policy process, extending the analysis we introduced in July.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Since my appearance before this Committee last June, the economy has continued to make progress toward our dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability. In the labor market, job gains averaged 190,000 per month over the second half of 2016, and the number of jobs rose an additional 227,000 in January. Those gains bring the total increase in employment since its trough in early 2010 to nearly 16 million. In addition, the unemployment rate, which stood at 4.8 percent in January, is more than 5 percentage points lower than where it stood at its peak in 2010 and is now in line with the median of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants' estimates of its longer-run normal level. A broader measure of labor underutilization, which includes those marginally attached to the labor force and people who are working part time but would like a full-time job, has also continued to improve over the past year. In addition, the pace of wage growth has picked up relative to its pace of a few years ago, a further indication that the job market is tightening. Importantly, improvements in the labor market in recent years have been widespread, with large declines in the unemployment rates for all major demographic groups, including African Americans and Hispanics. Even so, it is discouraging that jobless rates for those minorities remain significantly higher than the rate for the nation overall.Ongoing gains in the labor market have been accompanied by a further moderate expansion in economic activity. U.S. real gross domestic product is estimated to have risen 1.9 percent last year, the same as in 2015. Consumer spending has continued to rise at a healthy pace, supported by steady income gains, increases in the value of households' financial assets and homes, favorable levels of consumer sentiment, and low interest rates. Last year's sales of automobiles and light trucks were the highest annual total on record. In contrast, business investment was relatively soft for much of last year, though it posted some larger gains toward the end of the year in part reflecting an apparent end to the sharp declines in spending on drilling and mining structures; moreover, business sentiment has noticeably improved in the past few months. In addition, weak foreign growth and the appreciation of the dollar over the past two years have restrained manufacturing output. Meanwhile, housing construction has continued to trend up at only a modest pace in recent quarters. And, while the lean stock of homes for sale and ongoing labor market gains should provide some support to housing construction going forward, the recent increases in mortgage rates may impart some restraint.Inflation moved up over the past year, mainly because of the diminishing effects of the earlier declines in energy prices and import prices. Total consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index rose 1.6 percent in the 12 months ending in December, still below the FOMC's 2 percent objective but up 1 percentage point from its pace in 2015. Core PCE inflation, which excludes the volatile energy and food prices, moved up to about 1-3/4 percent.My colleagues on the FOMC and I expect the economy to continue to expand at a moderate pace, with the job market strengthening somewhat further and inflation gradually rising to 2 percent. This judgment reflects our view that U.S. monetary policy remains accommodative, and that the pace of global economic activity should pick up over time, supported by accommodative monetary policies abroad. Of course, our inflation outlook also depends importantly on our assessment that longer-run inflation expectations will remain reasonably well anchored. It is reassuring that while market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low, they have risen from the very low levels they reached during the latter part of 2015 and first half of 2016. Meanwhile, most survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations have changed little, on balance, in recent months.As always, considerable uncertainty attends the economic outlook. Among the sources of uncertainty are possible changes in U.S. fiscal and other policies, the future path of productivity growth, and developments abroad.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Turning to monetary policy, the FOMC is committed to promoting maximum employment and price stability, as mandated by the Congress. Against the backdrop of headwinds weighing on the economy over the past year, including financial market stresses that emanated from developments abroad, the Committee maintained an unchanged target range for the federal funds rate for most of the year in order to support improvement in the labor market and an increase in inflation toward 2 percent. At its December meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point, to 1/2 to 3/4 percent. In doing so, the Committee recognized the considerable progress the economy had made toward the FOMC's dual objectives. The Committee judged that even after this increase in the federal funds rate target, monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.At its meeting that concluded early this month, the Committee left the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged but reiterated that it expects the evolution of the economy to warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate to achieve and maintain its employment and inflation objectives. As I noted on previous occasions, waiting too long to remove accommodation would be unwise, potentially requiring the FOMC to eventually raise rates rapidly, which could risk disrupting financial markets and pushing the economy into recession. Incoming data suggest that labor market conditions continue to strengthen and inflation is moving up to 2 percent, consistent with the Committee's expectations. At our upcoming meetings, the Committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with these expectations, in which case a further adjustment of the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate.The Committee's view that gradual increases in the federal funds rate will likely be appropriate reflects the expectation that the neutral federal funds rate--that is, the interest rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary and that keeps the economy operating on an even keel--will rise somewhat over time. Current estimates of the neutral rate are well below pre-crisis levels--a phenomenon that may reflect slow productivity growth, subdued economic growth abroad, strong demand for safe longer-term assets, and other factors. The Committee anticipates that the depressing effect of these factors will diminish somewhat over time, raising the neutral funds rate, albeit to levels that are still low by historical standards.That said, the economic outlook is uncertain, and monetary policy is not on a preset course. FOMC participants will adjust their assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate in response to changes to the economic outlook and associated risks as informed by incoming data. Also, changes in fiscal policy or other economic policies could potentially affect the economic outlook. Of course, it is too early to know what policy changes will be put in place or how their economic effects will unfold. While it is not my intention to opine on specific tax or spending proposals, I would point to the importance of improving the pace of longer-run economic growth and raising American living standards with policies aimed at improving productivity. I would also hope that fiscal policy changes will be consistent with putting U.S. fiscal accounts on a sustainable trajectory. In any event, it is important to remember that fiscal policy is only one of the many factors that can influence the economic outlook and the appropriate course of monetary policy. Overall, the FOMC's monetary policy decisions will be directed to the attainment of its congressionally mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability.Finally, the Committee has continued its policy of reinvesting proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from agency debt and mortgage-backed securities. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, has helped maintain accommodative financial conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"In the labor market, the number of nonfarm payroll jobs rose 2.7 million in 2015, and posted a further gain of 150,000 in January of this year. The cumulative increase in employment since its trough in early 2010, is now more than 13 million jobs. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate fell to 4.9 percent in January, 0.8 percentage point below its level a year ago and in line with the median of FOMC participants' most recent estimates of its longer-run normal level. Other measures of labor market conditions have also shown solid improvement, with noticeable declines over the past year in the number of individuals who want and are available to work but have not actively searched recently, and in the number of people who are working part time but would rather work full time. However, these measures remain above the levels seen prior to the recession, suggesting that some slack in labor markets remains. Thus, while labor market conditions have improved substantially, there is still room for further sustainable improvement.The strong gains in the job market last year were accompanied by a continued moderate expansion in economic activity. U.S. real gross domestic product is estimated to have increased about 1-3/4 percent in 2015. Over the course of the year, subdued foreign growth and the appreciation of the dollar restrained net exports. In the fourth quarter of last year, growth in the gross domestic product is reported to have slowed more sharply, to an annual rate of just 3/4 percent; again, growth was held back by weak net exports as well as by a negative contribution from inventory investment. Although private domestic final demand appears to have slowed somewhat in the fourth quarter, it has continued to advance. Household spending has been supported by steady job gains and solid growth in real disposable income--aided in part by the declines in oil prices. One area of particular strength has been purchases of cars and light trucks; sales of these vehicles in 2015, reached their highest level ever. In the drilling and mining sector, lower oil prices have caused companies to slash jobs and sharply cut capital outlays, but in most other sectors, business investment rose over the second half of last year. And homebuilding activity has continued to move up, on balance, although the level of new construction remains well below the longer-run levels implied by demographic trends.Financial conditions in the United States have recently become less supportive of growth, with declines in broad measures of equity prices, higher borrowing rates for riskier borrowers, and a further appreciation of the dollar. These developments, if they prove persistent, could weigh on the outlook for economic activity and the labor market, although declines in longer-term interest rates and oil prices provide some offset. Still, ongoing employment gains and faster wage growth should support the growth of real incomes and therefore consumer spending, and global economic growth should pick up over time, supported by highly accommodative monetary policies abroad. Against this backdrop, the Committee expects that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in coming years and that labor market indicators will continue to strengthen.As is always the case, the economic outlook is uncertain. Foreign economic developments, in particular, pose risks to U.S. economic growth. Most notably, although recent economic indicators do not suggest a sharp slowdown in Chinese growth, declines in the foreign exchange value of the renminbi have intensified uncertainty about China's exchange rate policy and the prospects for its economy. This uncertainty led to increased volatility in global financial markets and, against the background of persistent weakness abroad, exacerbated concerns about the outlook for global growth. These growth concerns, along with strong supply conditions and high inventories, contributed to the recent fall in the prices of oil and other commodities. In turn, low commodity prices could trigger financial stresses in commodity-exporting economies, particularly in vulnerable emerging market economies, and for commodity-producing firms in many countries. Should any of these downside risks materialize, foreign activity and demand for U.S. exports could weaken and financial market conditions could tighten further.Of course, economic growth could also exceed our projections for a number of reasons, including the possibility that low oil prices will boost U.S. economic growth more than we expect. At present, the Committee is closely monitoring global economic and financial developments, as well as assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation and the balance of risks to the outlook.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Turning to monetary policy, the FOMC conducts policy to promote maximum employment and price stability, as required by our statutory mandate from the Congress. Last March, the Committee stated that it would be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it had seen further improvement in the labor market and was reasonably confident that inflation would move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term. In December, the Committee judged that these two criteria had been satisfied and decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 1/4 percentage point, to between 1/4 and 1/2 percent. This increase marked the end of a seven-year period during which the federal funds rate was held near zero. The Committee did not adjust the target range in January.The decision in December to raise the federal funds rate reflected the Committee's assessment that, even after a modest reduction in policy accommodation, economic activity would continue to expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators would continue to strengthen. Although inflation was running below the Committee's longer-run objective, the FOMC judged that much of the softness in inflation was attributable to transitory factors that are likely to abate over time, and that diminishing slack in labor and product markets would help move inflation toward 2 percent. In addition, the Committee recognized that it takes time for monetary policy actions to affect economic conditions. If the FOMC delayed the start of policy normalization for too long, it might have to tighten policy relatively abruptly in the future to keep the economy from overheating and inflation from significantly overshooting its objective. Such an abrupt tightening could increase the risk of pushing the economy into recession.It is important to note that even after this increase, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative. The FOMC anticipates that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate. In addition, the Committee expects that the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below the levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. This expectation is consistent with the view that the neutral nominal federal funds rate--defined as the value of the federal funds rate that would be neither expansionary nor contractionary if the economy was operating near potential--is currently low by historical standards and is likely to rise only gradually over time. The low level of the neutral federal funds rate may be partially attributable to a range of persistent economic headwinds--such as limited access to credit for some borrowers, weak growth abroad, and a significant appreciation of the dollar--that have weighed on aggregate demand.Of course, monetary policy is by no means on a preset course. The actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on what incoming data tell us about the economic outlook, and we will regularly reassess what level of the federal funds rate is consistent with achieving and maintaining maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. In doing so, we will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. In particular, stronger growth or a more rapid increase in inflation than the Committee currently anticipates would suggest that the neutral federal funds rate was rising more quickly than expected, making it appropriate to raise the federal funds rate more quickly as well. Conversely, if the economy were to disappoint, a lower path of the federal funds rate would be appropriate. We are committed to our dual objectives, and we will adjust policy as appropriate to foster financial conditions consistent with the attainment of our objectives over time.Consistent with its previous communications, the Federal Reserve used interest on excess reserves (IOER) and overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) operations to move the federal funds rate into the new target range. The adjustment to the IOER rate has been particularly important in raising the federal funds rate and short-term interest rates more generally in an environment of abundant bank reserves. Meanwhile, overnight RRP operations complement the IOER rate by establishing a soft floor on money market interest rates. The IOER rate and the overnight RRP operations allowed the FOMC to control the federal funds rate effectively without having to first shrink its balance sheet by selling a large part of its holdings of longer-term securities. The Committee judged that removing monetary policy accommodation by the traditional approach of raising short-term interest rates is preferable to selling longer-term assets because such sales could be difficult to calibrate and could generate unexpected financial market reactions.The Committee is continuing its policy of reinvesting proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from agency debt and mortgage-backed securities. As highlighted in the December statement, the FOMC anticipates continuing this policy ""until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way."" Maintaining our sizable holdings of longer-term securities should help maintain accommodative financial conditions and reduce the risk that we might need to return the federal funds rate target to the effective lower bound in response to future adverse shocks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Since my appearance before this Committee last July, the employment situation in the United States has been improving along many dimensions. The unemployment rate now stands at 5.7 percent, down from just over 6 percent last summer and from 10 percent at its peak in late 2009. The average pace of monthly job gains picked up from about 240,000 per month during the first half of last year to 280,000 per month during the second half, and employment rose 260,000 in January. In addition, long-term unemployment has declined substantially, fewer workers are reporting that they can find only part-time work when they would prefer full-time employment, and the pace of quits--often regarded as a barometer of worker confidence in labor market opportunities--has recovered nearly to its pre-recession level. However, the labor force participation rate is lower than most estimates of its trend, and wage growth remains sluggish, suggesting that some cyclical weakness persists. In short, considerable progress has been achieved in the recovery of the labor market, though room for further improvement remains.At the same time that the labor market situation has improved, domestic spending and production have been increasing at a solid rate. Real gross domestic product (GDP) is now estimated to have increased at a 3-3/4 percent annual rate during the second half of last year. While GDP growth is not anticipated to be sustained at that pace, it is expected to be strong enough to result in a further gradual decline in the unemployment rate. Consumer spending has been lifted by the improvement in the labor market as well as by the increase in household purchasing power resulting from the sharp drop in oil prices. However, housing construction continues to lag; activity remains well below levels we judge could be supported in the longer run by population growth and the likely rate of household formation.Despite the overall improvement in the U.S. economy and the U.S. economic outlook, longer-term interest rates in the United States and other advanced economies have moved down significantly since the middle of last year; the declines have reflected, at least in part, disappointing foreign growth and changes in monetary policy abroad. Another notable development has been the plunge in oil prices. The bulk of this decline appears to reflect increased global supply rather than weaker global demand. While the drop in oil prices will have negative effects on energy producers and will probably result in job losses in this sector, causing hardship for affected workers and their families, it will likely be a significant overall plus, on net, for our economy. Primarily, that boost will arise from U.S. households having the wherewithal to increase their spending on other goods and services as they spend less on gasoline.Foreign economic developments, however, could pose risks to the outlook for U.S. economic growth. Although the pace of growth abroad appears to have stepped up slightly in the second half of last year, foreign economies are confronting a number of challenges that could restrain economic activity. In China, economic growth could slow more than anticipated as policymakers address financial vulnerabilities and manage the desired transition to less reliance on exports and investment as sources of growth. In the euro area, recovery remains slow, and inflation has fallen to very low levels; although highly accommodative monetary policy should help boost economic growth and inflation there, downside risks to economic activity in the region remain. The uncertainty surrounding the foreign outlook, however, does not exclusively reflect downside risks. We could see economic activity respond to the policy stimulus now being provided by foreign central banks more strongly than we currently anticipate, and the recent decline in world oil prices could boost overall global economic growth more than we expect.U.S. inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent objective. In large part, the recent softness in the all-items measure of inflation for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) reflects the drop in oil prices. Indeed, the PCE price index edged down during the fourth quarter of last year and looks to be on track to register a more significant decline this quarter because of falling consumer energy prices. But core PCE inflation has also slowed since last summer, in part reflecting declines in the prices of many imported items and perhaps also some pass-through of lower energy costs into core consumer prices.Despite the very low recent readings on actual inflation, inflation expectations as measured in a range of surveys of households and professional forecasters have thus far remained stable. However, inflation compensation, as calculated from the yields of real and nominal Treasury securities, has declined. As best we can tell, the fall in inflation compensation mainly reflects factors other than a reduction in longer-term inflation expectations. The Committee expects inflation to decline further in the near term before rising gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of lower energy prices and other factors dissipate, but we will continue to monitor inflation developments closely.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"I will now turn to monetary policy. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is committed to policies that promote maximum employment and price stability, consistent with our mandate from the Congress. As my description of economic developments indicated, our economy has made important progress toward the objective of maximum employment, reflecting in part support from the highly accommodative stance of monetary policy in recent years. In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the substantial improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions--the stated objective of the Committee's recent asset purchase program--the FOMC concluded that program at the end of October.Even so, the Committee judges that a high degree of policy accommodation remains appropriate to foster further improvement in labor market conditions and to promote a return of inflation toward 2 percent over the medium term. Accordingly, the FOMC has continued to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and to keep the Federal Reserve's holdings of longer-term securities at their current elevated level to help maintain accommodative financial conditions. The FOMC is also providing forward guidance that offers information about our policy outlook and expectations for the future path of the federal funds rate. In that regard, the Committee judged, in December and January, that it can be patient in beginning to raise the federal funds rate. This judgment reflects the fact that inflation continues to run well below the Committee's 2 percent objective, and that room for sustainable improvements in labor market conditions still remains.The FOMC's assessment that it can be patient in beginning to normalize policy means that the Committee considers it unlikely that economic conditions will warrant an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate for at least the next couple of FOMC meetings. If economic conditions continue to improve, as the Committee anticipates, the Committee will at some point begin considering an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate on a meeting-by-meeting basis. Before then, the Committee will change its forward guidance. However, it is important to emphasize that a modification of the forward guidance should not be read as indicating that the Committee will necessarily increase the target range in a couple of meetings. Instead the modification should be understood as reflecting the Committee's judgment that conditions have improved to the point where it will soon be the case that a change in the target range could be warranted at any meeting. Provided that labor market conditions continue to improve and further improvement is expected, the Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when, on the basis of incoming data, the Committee is reasonably confident that inflation will move back over the medium term toward our 2 percent objective.It continues to be the FOMC's assessment that even after employment and inflation are near levels consistent with our dual mandate, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run. It is possible, for example, that it may be necessary for the federal funds rate to run temporarily below its normal longer-run level because the residual effects of the financial crisis may continue to weigh on economic activity. As such factors continue to dissipate, we would expect the federal funds rate to move toward its longer-run normal level. In response to unforeseen developments, the Committee will adjust the target range for the federal funds rate to best promote the achievement of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Let me now turn to the mechanics of how we intend to normalize the stance and conduct of monetary policy when a decision is eventually made to raise the target range for the federal funds rate. Last September, the FOMC issued its statement on Policy Normalization Principles and Plans. This statement provides information about the Committee's likely approach to raising short-term interest rates and reducing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings. As is always the case in setting policy, the Committee will determine the timing and pace of policy normalization so as to promote its statutory mandate to foster maximum employment and price stability.The FOMC intends to adjust the stance of monetary policy during normalization primarily by changing its target range for the federal funds rate and not by actively managing the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. The Committee is confident that it has the tools it needs to raise short-term interest rates when it becomes appropriate to do so and to maintain reasonable control of the level of short-term interest rates as policy continues to firm thereafter, even though the level of reserves held by depository institutions is likely to diminish only gradually. The primary means of raising the federal funds rate will be to increase the rate of interest paid on excess reserves. The Committee also will use an overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility and other supplementary tools as needed to help control the federal funds rate. As economic and financial conditions evolve, the Committee will phase out these supplementary tools when they are no longer needed.The Committee intends to reduce its securities holdings in a gradual and predictable manner primarily by ceasing to reinvest repayments of principal from securities held by the Federal Reserve. It is the Committee's intention to hold, in the longer run, no more securities than necessary for the efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy, and that these securities be primarily Treasury securities.

other,,"In sum, since the July 2014 Monetary Policy Report, there has been important progress toward the FOMC's objective of maximum employment. However, despite this improvement, too many Americans remain unemployed or underemployed, wage growth is still sluggish, and inflation remains well below our longer-run objective. As always, the Federal Reserve remains committed to employing its tools to best promote the attainment of its objectives of maximum employment and price stability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The economic recovery gained greater traction in the second half of last year. Real gross domestic product (GDP) is currently estimated to have risen at an average annual rate of more than 3-1/2 percent in the third and fourth quarters, up from a 1-3/4 percent pace in the first half. The pickup in economic activity has fueled further progress in the labor market. About 1-1/4 million jobs have been added to payrolls since the previous Monetary Policy Report last July, and 3-1/4 million have been added since August 2012, the month before the Federal Reserve began a new round of asset purchases to add momentum to the recovery. The unemployment rate has fallen nearly a percentage point since the middle of last year and 1-1/2 percentage points since the beginning of the current asset purchase program. Nevertheless, the recovery in the labor market is far from complete. The unemployment rate is still well above levels that Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants estimate is consistent with maximum sustainable employment. Those out of a job for more than six months continue to make up an unusually large fraction of the unemployed, and the number of people who are working part time but would prefer a full-time job remains very high. These observations underscore the importance of considering more than the unemployment rate when evaluating the condition of the U.S. labor market.Among the major components of GDP, household and business spending growth stepped up during the second half of last year. Early in 2013, growth in consumer spending was restrained by changes in fiscal policy. As this restraint abated during the second half of the year, household spending accelerated, supported by job gains and by rising home values and equity prices. Similarly, growth in business investment started off slowly last year but then picked up during the second half, reflecting improving sales prospects, greater confidence, and still-favorable financing conditions. In contrast, the recovery in the housing sector slowed in the wake of last year's increase in mortgage rates.Inflation remained low as the economy picked up strength, with both the headline and core personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, price indexes rising only about 1 percent last year, well below the FOMC's 2 percent objective for inflation over the longer run. Some of the recent softness reflects factors that seem likely to prove transitory, including falling prices for crude oil and declines in non-oil import prices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Turning to monetary policy, let me emphasize that I expect a great deal of continuity in the FOMC's approach to monetary policy. I served on the Committee as we formulated our current policy strategy and I strongly support that strategy, which is designed to fulfill the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate of maximum employment and price stability.Prior to the financial crisis, the FOMC carried out monetary policy by adjusting its target for the federal funds rate. With that rate near zero since late 2008, we have relied on two less-traditional tools--asset purchases and forward guidance--to help the economy move toward maximum employment and price stability. Both tools put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and support asset prices. In turn, these more accommodative financial conditions support consumer spending, business investment, and housing construction, adding impetus to the recovery.Our current program of asset purchases began in September 2012 amid signs that the recovery was weakening and progress in the labor market had slowed. The Committee said that it would continue the program until there was a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in a context of price stability. In mid-2013, the Committee indicated that if progress toward its objectives continued as expected, a moderation in the monthly pace of purchases would likely become appropriate later in the year. In December, the Committee judged that the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions warranted a modest reduction in the pace of purchases, from $45 billion to $40 billion per month of longer-term Treasury securities and from $40 billion to $35 billion per month of agency mortgage-backed securities. At its January meeting, the Committee decided to make additional reductions of the same magnitude. If incoming information broadly supports the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings. That said, purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on its outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.The Committee has emphasized that a highly accommodative policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after asset purchases end. In addition, the Committee has said since December 2012 that it expects the current low target range for the federal funds rate to be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above our 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. Crossing one of these thresholds will not automatically prompt an increase in the federal funds rate, but will instead indicate only that it had become appropriate for the Committee to consider whether the broader economic outlook would justify such an increase. In December of last year and again this January, the Committee said that its current expectation--based on its assessment of a broad range of measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments--is that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6-1/2 percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the 2 percent goal. I am committed to achieving both parts of our dual mandate: helping the economy return to full employment and returning inflation to 2 percent while ensuring that it does not run persistently above or below that level.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"I will finish with an update on progress on regulatory reforms and supervisory actions to strengthen the financial system. In October, the Federal Reserve Board proposed a rule to strengthen the liquidity positions of large and internationally active financial institutions.1 Together with other federal agencies, the Board also issued a final rule implementing the Volcker rule, which prohibits banking firms from engaging in short-term proprietary trading of certain financial instruments.2 On the supervisory front, the next round of annual capital stress tests of the largest 30 bank holding companies is under way, and we expect to report results in March.Regulatory and supervisory actions, including those that are leading to substantial increases in capital and liquidity in the banking sector, are making our financial system more resilient. Still, important tasks lie ahead. In the near term, we expect to finalize the rules implementing enhanced prudential standards mandated by section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. We also are working to finalize the proposed rule strengthening the leverage ratio standards for U.S.-based, systemically important global banks. We expect to issue proposals for a risk-based capital surcharge for those banks as well as for a long-term debt requirement to help ensure that these organizations can be resolved. In addition, we are working to advance proposals on margins for noncleared derivatives, consistent with a new global framework, and are evaluating possible measures to address financial stability risks associated with short-term wholesale funding. We will continue to monitor for emerging risks, including watching carefully to see if the regulatory reforms work as intended.Since the financial crisis and the depths of the recession, substantial progress has been made in restoring the economy to health and in strengthening the financial system. Still, there is more to do. Too many Americans remain unemployed, inflation remains below our longer-run objective, and the work of making the financial system more robust has not yet been completed. I look forward to working with my colleagues and many others to carry out the important mission you have given the Federal Reserve.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The economy is continuing to make progress toward the Federal Reserve's objectives of maximum employment and price stability.In the labor market, gains in total nonfarm payroll employment averaged about 230,000 per month over the first half of this year, a somewhat stronger pace than in 2013 and enough to bring the total increase in jobs during the economic recovery thus far to more than 9 million. The unemployment rate has fallen nearly 1-1/2 percentage points over the past year and stood at 6.1 percent in June, down about 4 percentage points from its peak. Broader measures of labor utilization have also registered notable improvements over the past year.Real gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have declined sharply in the first quarter. The decline appears to have resulted mostly from transitory factors, and a number of recent indicators of production and spending suggest that growth rebounded in the second quarter, but this bears close watching. The housing sector, however, has shown little recent progress. While this sector has recovered notably from its earlier trough, housing activity leveled off in the wake of last year's increase in mortgage rates, and readings this year have, overall, continued to be disappointing.Although the economy continues to improve, the recovery is not yet complete. Even with the recent declines, the unemployment rate remains above Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants' estimates of its longer-run normal level. Labor force participation appears weaker than one would expect based on the aging of the population and the level of unemployment. These and other indications that significant slack remains in labor markets are corroborated by the continued slow pace of growth in most measures of hourly compensation.Inflation has moved up in recent months but remains below the FOMC's 2 percent objective for inflation over the longer run. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased 1.8 percent over the 12 months through May. Pressures on food and energy prices account for some of the increase in PCE price inflation. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 1.5 percent. Most Committee participants project that both total and core inflation will be between 1-1/2 and 1-3/4 percent for this year as a whole.Although the decline in GDP in the first quarter led to some downgrading of our growth projections for this year, I and other FOMC participants continue to anticipate that economic activity will expand at a moderate pace over the next several years, supported by accommodative monetary policy, a waning drag from fiscal policy, the lagged effects of higher home prices and equity values, and strengthening foreign growth. The Committee sees the projected pace of economic growth as sufficient to support ongoing improvement in the labor market with further job gains, and the unemployment rate is anticipated to continue to decline toward its longer-run sustainable level. Consistent with the anticipated further recovery in the labor market, and given that longer-term inflation expectations appear to be well anchored, we expect inflation to move back toward our 2 percent objective over coming years.As always, considerable uncertainty surrounds our projections for economic growth, unemployment, and inflation. FOMC participants currently judge these risks to be nearly balanced but to warrant monitoring in the months ahead.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"I will now turn to monetary policy. The FOMC is committed to policies that promote maximum employment and price stability, consistent with our dual mandate from the Congress. Given the economic situation that I just described, we judge that a high degree of monetary policy accommodation remains appropriate. Consistent with that assessment, we have maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and have continued to rely on large-scale asset purchases and forward guidance about the future path of the federal funds rate to provide the appropriate level of support for the economy.In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment that has occurred since the inception of the Federal Reserve's asset purchase program in September 2012 and the FOMC's assessment that labor market conditions would continue to improve, the Committee has made measured reductions in the monthly pace of our asset purchases at each of our regular meetings this year. If incoming data continue to support our expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward 2 percent, the Committee likely will make further measured reductions in the pace of asset purchases at upcoming meetings, with purchases concluding after the October meeting. Even after the Committee ends these purchases, the Federal Reserve's sizable holdings of longer-term securities will help maintain accommodative financial conditions, thus supporting further progress in returning employment and inflation to mandate-consistent levels.The Committee is also fostering accommodative financial conditions through forward guidance that provides greater clarity about our policy outlook and expectations for the future path of the federal funds rate. Since March, our postmeeting statements have included a description of the framework that is guiding our monetary policy decisions. Specifically, our decisions are and will be based on an assessment of the progress--both realized and expected--toward our objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. Our evaluation will not hinge on one or two factors, but rather will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation and long-term inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.Based on its assessment of these factors, in June the Committee reiterated its expectation that the current target range for the federal funds rate likely will be appropriate for a considerable period after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal and provided that inflation expectations remain well anchored. In addition, we currently anticipate that even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the federal funds rate below levels that the Committee views as normal in the longer run.Of course, the outlook for the economy and financial markets is never certain, and now is no exception. Therefore, the Committee's decisions about the path of the federal funds rate remain dependent on our assessment of incoming information and the implications for the economic outlook. If the labor market continues to improve more quickly than anticipated by the Committee, resulting in faster convergence toward our dual objectives, then increases in the federal funds rate target likely would occur sooner and be more rapid than currently envisioned. Conversely, if economic performance is disappointing, then the future path of interest rates likely would be more accommodative than currently anticipated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The Committee recognizes that low interest rates may provide incentives for some investors to ""reach for yield,"" and those actions could increase vulnerabilities in the financial system to adverse events. While prices of real estate, equities, and corporate bonds have risen appreciably and valuation metrics have increased, they remain generally in line with historical norms. In some sectors, such as lower-rated corporate debt, valuations appear stretched and issuance has been brisk. Accordingly, we are closely monitoring developments in the leveraged loan market and are working to enhance the effectiveness of our supervisory guidance. More broadly, the financial sector has continued to become more resilient, as banks have continued to boost their capital and liquidity positions, and growth in wholesale short-term funding in financial markets has been modest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"In sum, since the February Monetary Policy Report, further important progress has been made in restoring the economy to health and in strengthening the financial system. Yet too many Americans remain unemployed, inflation remains below our longer-run objective, and not all of the necessary financial reform initiatives have been completed. The Federal Reserve remains committed to employing all of its resources and tools to achieve its macroeconomic objectives and to foster a stronger and more resilient financial system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Since I last reported to this Committee in mid-2012, economic activity in the United States has continued to expand at a moderate if somewhat uneven pace. In particular, real gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have risen at an annual rate of about 3 percent in the third quarter but to have been essentially flat in the fourth quarter.1 The pause in real GDP growth last quarter does not appear to reflect a stalling-out of the recovery. Rather, economic activity was temporarily restrained by weather-related disruptions and by transitory declines in a few volatile categories of spending, even as demand by U.S. households and businesses continued to expand. Available information suggests that economic growth has picked up again this year.Consistent with the moderate pace of economic growth, conditions in the labor market have been improving gradually. Since July, nonfarm payroll employment has increased by 175,000 jobs per month on average, and the unemployment rate declined 0.3 percentage point to 7.9 percent over the same period. Cumulatively, private-sector payrolls have now grown by about 6.1 million jobs since their low point in early 2010, and the unemployment rate has fallen a bit more than 2 percentage points since its cyclical peak in late 2009. Despite these gains, however, the job market remains generally weak, with the unemployment rate well above its longer-run normal level. About 4.7 million of the unemployed have been without a job for six months or more, and millions more would like full-time employment but are able to find only part-time work. High unemployment has substantial costs, including not only the hardship faced by the unemployed and their families, but also the harm done to the vitality and productive potential of our economy as a whole. Lengthy periods of unemployment and underemployment can erode workers' skills and attachment to the labor force or prevent young people from gaining skills and experience in the first place--developments that could significantly reduce their productivity and earnings in the longer term. The loss of output and earnings associated with high unemployment also reduces government revenues and increases spending, thereby leading to larger deficits and higher levels of debt.The recent increase in gasoline prices, which reflects both higher crude oil prices and wider refining margins, is hitting family budgets. However, overall inflation remains low. Over the second half of 2012, the price index for personal consumption expenditures rose at an annual rate of 1-1/2 percent, similar to the rate of increase in the first half of the year. Measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained in the narrow ranges seen over the past several years. Against this backdrop, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"With unemployment well above normal levels and inflation subdued, progress toward the Federal Reserve's mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability has required a highly accommodative monetary policy. Under normal circumstances, policy accommodation would be provided through reductions in the FOMC's target for the federal funds rate--the interest rate on overnight loans between banks. However, as this rate has been close to zero since December 2008, the Federal Reserve has had to use alternative policy tools.These alternative tools have fallen into two categories. The first is ""forward guidance"" regarding the FOMC's anticipated path for the federal funds rate. Since longer-term interest rates reflect market expectations for shorter-term rates over time, our guidance influences longer-term rates and thus supports a stronger recovery. The formulation of this guidance has evolved over time. Between August 2011 and December 2012, the Committee used calendar dates to indicate how long it expected economic conditions to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate. At its December 2012 meeting, the FOMC agreed to shift to providing more explicit guidance on how it expects the policy rate to respond to economic developments. Specifically, the December postmeeting statement indicated that the current exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate ""will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.""2 An advantage of the new formulation, relative to the previous date-based guidance, is that it allows market participants and the public to update their monetary policy expectations more accurately in response to new information about the economic outlook. The new guidance also serves to underscore the Committee's intention to maintain accommodation as long as needed to promote a stronger economic recovery with stable prices.The second type of nontraditional policy tool employed by the FOMC is large-scale purchases of longer-term securities, which, like our forward guidance, are intended to support economic growth by putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates. The Federal Reserve has engaged in several rounds of such purchases since late 2008. Last September the FOMC announced that it would purchase agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month, and in December the Committee stated that, in addition, beginning in January it would purchase longer-term Treasury securities at an initial pace of $45 billion per month.4 These additional purchases of longer-term Treasury securities replace the purchases we were conducting under our now-completed maturity extension program, which lengthened the maturity of our securities portfolio without increasing its size. The FOMC has indicated that it will continue purchases until it observes a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in a context of price stability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The Committee also stated that in determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, it will take appropriate account of their likely efficacy and costs. In other words, as with all of its policy decisions, the Committee continues to assess its program of asset purchases within a cost-benefit framework. In the current economic environment, the benefits of asset purchases, and of policy accommodation more generally, are clear: Monetary policy is providing important support to the recovery while keeping inflation close to the FOMC's 2 percent objective. Notably, keeping longer-term interest rates low has helped spark recovery in the housing market and led to increased sales and production of automobiles and other durable goods. By raising employment and household wealth--for example, through higher home prices__these developments have in turn supported consumer sentiment and spending.Highly accommodative monetary policy also has several potential costs and risks, which the Committee is monitoring closely. For example, if further expansion of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet were to undermine public confidence in our ability to exit smoothly from our accommodative policies at the appropriate time, inflation expectations could rise, putting the FOMC's price-stability objective at risk. However, the Committee remains confident that it has the tools necessary to tighten monetary policy when the time comes to do so. As I noted, inflation is currently subdued, and inflation expectations appear well anchored; neither the FOMC nor private forecasters are projecting the development of significant inflation pressures.Another potential cost that the Committee takes very seriously is the possibility that very low interest rates, if maintained for a considerable time, could impair financial stability. For example, portfolio managers dissatisfied with low returns may ""reach for yield"" by taking on more credit risk, duration risk, or leverage. On the other hand, some risk-taking--such as when an entrepreneur takes out a loan to start a new business or an existing firm expands capacity--is a necessary element of a healthy economic recovery. Moreover, although accommodative monetary policies may increase certain types of risk-taking, in the present circumstances they also serve in some ways to reduce risk in the system, most importantly by strengthening the overall economy, but also by encouraging firms to rely more on longer-term funding, and by reducing debt service costs for households and businesses. In any case, the Federal Reserve is responding actively to financial stability concerns through substantially expanded monitoring of emerging risks in the financial system, an approach to the supervision of financial firms that takes a more systemic perspective, and the ongoing implementation of reforms to make the financial system more transparent and resilient. Although a long period of low rates could encourage excessive risk-taking, and continued close attention to such developments is certainly warranted, to this point we do not see the potential costs of the increased risk-taking in some financial markets as outweighing the benefits of promoting a stronger economic recovery and more-rapid job creation.5",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Another aspect of the Federal Reserve's policies that has been discussed is their implications for the federal budget. The Federal Reserve earns substantial interest on the assets it holds in its portfolio, and, other than the amount needed to fund our cost of operations, all net income is remitted to the Treasury. With the expansion of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, yearly remittances have roughly tripled in recent years, with payments to the Treasury totaling approximately $290 billion between 2009 and 2012.6 However, if the economy continues to strengthen, as we anticipate, and policy accommodation is accordingly reduced, these remittances would likely decline in coming years. Federal Reserve analysis shows that remittances to the Treasury could be quite low for a time in some scenarios, particularly if interest rates were to rise quickly.7 However, even in such scenarios, it is highly likely that average annual remittances over the period affected by the Federal Reserve's purchases will remain higher than the pre-crisis norm, perhaps substantially so. Moreover, to the extent that monetary policy promotes growth and job creation, the resulting reduction in the federal deficit would dwarf any variation in the Federal Reserve's remittances to the Treasury.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Although monetary policy is working to promote a more robust recovery, it cannot carry the entire burden of ensuring a speedier return to economic health. The economy's performance both over the near term and in the longer run will depend importantly on the course of fiscal policy. The challenge for the Congress and the Administration is to put the federal budget on a sustainable long-run path that promotes economic growth and stability without unnecessarily impeding the current recovery.Significant progress has been made recently toward reducing the federal budget deficit over the next few years. The projections released earlier this month by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) indicate that, under current law, the federal deficit will narrow from 7 percent of GDP last year to 2-1/2 percent in fiscal year 2015.8 As a result, the federal debt held by the public (including that held by the Federal Reserve) is projected to remain roughly 75 percent of GDP through much of the current decade.However, a substantial portion of the recent progress in lowering the deficit has been concentrated in near-term budget changes, which, taken together, could create a significant headwind for the economic recovery. The CBO estimates that deficit-reduction policies in current law will slow the pace of real GDP growth by about 1-1/2 percentage points this year, relative to what it would have been otherwise. A significant portion of this effect is related to the automatic spending sequestration that is scheduled to begin on March 1, which, according to the CBO's estimates, will contribute about 0.6 percentage point to the fiscal drag on economic growth this year. Given the still-moderate underlying pace of economic growth, this additional near-term burden on the recovery is significant. Moreover, besides having adverse effects on jobs and incomes, a slower recovery would lead to less actual deficit reduction in the short run for any given set of fiscal actions.At the same time, and despite progress in reducing near-term budget deficits, the difficult process of addressing longer-term fiscal imbalances has only begun. Indeed, the CBO projects that the federal deficit and debt as a percentage of GDP will begin rising again in the latter part of this decade, reflecting in large part the aging of the population and fast-rising health-care costs. To promote economic growth in the longer term, and to preserve economic and financial stability, fiscal policymakers will have to put the federal budget on a sustainable long-run path that first stabilizes the ratio of federal debt to GDP and, given the current elevated level of debt, eventually places that ratio on a downward trajectory. Between 1960 and the onset of the financial crisis, federal debt averaged less than 40 percent of GDP. This relatively low level of debt provided the nation much-needed flexibility to meet the economic challenges of the past few years. Replenishing this fiscal capacity will give future Congresses and Administrations greater scope to deal with unforeseen events.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"To address both the near- and longer-term issues, the Congress and the Administration should consider replacing the sharp, frontloaded spending cuts required by the sequestration with policies that reduce the federal deficit more gradually in the near term but more substantially in the longer run. Such an approach could lessen the near-term fiscal headwinds facing the recovery while more effectively addressing the longer-term imbalances in the federal budget.The sizes of deficits and debt matter, of course, but not all tax and spending programs are created equal with respect to their effects on the economy. To the greatest extent possible, in their efforts to achieve sound public finances, fiscal policymakers should not lose sight of the need for federal tax and spending policies that increase incentives to work and save, encourage investments in workforce skills, advance private capital formation, promote research and development, and provide necessary and productive public infrastructure. Although economic growth alone cannot eliminate federal budget imbalances, in either the short or longer term, a more rapidly expanding economic pie will ease the difficult choices we face.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Following the stabilization of economic activity in mid-2009, the U.S. economy is now in its seventh quarter of growth; last quarter, for the first time in this expansion, our nation's real gross domestic product (GDP) matched its pre-crisis peak. Nevertheless, job growth remains relatively weak and the unemployment rate is still high.In its early stages, the economic recovery was largely attributable to the stabilization of the financial system, the effects of expansionary monetary and fiscal policies, and a strong boost to production from businesses rebuilding their depleted inventories. Economic growth slowed significantly in the spring and early summer of 2010, as the impetus from inventory building and fiscal stimulus diminished and as Europe's debt problems roiled global financial markets. More recently, however, we have seen increased evidence that a self-sustaining recovery in consumer and business spending may be taking hold. Notably, real consumer spending has grown at a solid pace since last fall, and business investment in new equipment and software has continued to expand. Stronger demand, both domestic and foreign, has supported steady gains in U.S. manufacturing output.The combination of rising household and business confidence, accommodative monetary policy, and improving credit conditions seems likely to lead to a somewhat more rapid pace of economic recovery in 2011 than we saw last year. The most recent economic projections by Federal Reserve Board members and Reserve Bank presidents, prepared in conjunction with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in late January, are for real GDP to increase 3-1/2 to 4 percent in 2011, about one-half percentage point higher than our projections made in November.1 Private forecasters' projections for 2011 are broadly consistent with those of the FOMC participants and have also moved up in recent months.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"While indicators of spending and production have been encouraging on balance, the job market has improved only slowly. Following the loss of about 8-3/4 million jobs from early 2008 through 2009, private-sector employment expanded by only a little more than 1 million during 2010, a gain barely sufficient to accommodate the inflow of recent graduates and other entrants to the labor force. We do see some grounds for optimism about the job market over the next few quarters, including notable declines in the unemployment rate in December and January, a drop in new claims for unemployment insurance, and an improvement in firms' hiring plans. Even so, if the rate of economic growth remains moderate, as projected, it could be several years before the unemployment rate has returned to a more normal level. Indeed, FOMC participants generally see the unemployment rate still in the range of 7-1/2 to 8 percent at the end of 2012. Until we see a sustained period of stronger job creation, we cannot consider the recovery to be truly established.Likewise, the housing sector remains exceptionally weak. The overhang of vacant and foreclosed houses is still weighing heavily on prices of new and existing homes, and sales and construction of new single-family homes remain depressed. Although mortgage rates are low and house prices have reached more affordable levels, many potential homebuyers are still finding mortgages difficult to obtain and remain concerned about possible further declines in home values.Inflation has declined, on balance, since the onset of the financial crisis, reflecting high levels of resource slack and stable longer-term inflation expectations. Indeed, over the 12 months ending in January, prices for all of the goods and services consumed by households (as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)) increased by only 1.2 percent, down from 2.5 percent in the year-earlier period. Wage growth has slowed as well, with average hourly earnings increasing only 1.9 percent over the year ending in January. In combination with productivity increases, slow wage growth has implied very tight restraint on labor costs per unit of output.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"FOMC participants see inflation remaining low; most project that overall inflation will be about 1-1/4 to 1-3/4 percent this year and in the range of 1 to 2 percent next year and in 2013. Private-sector forecasters generally also anticipate subdued inflation over the next few years.3 Measures of medium- and long-term inflation compensation derived from inflation-indexed Treasury bonds appear broadly consistent with these forecasts. Surveys of households suggest that the public's longer-term inflation expectations also remain stable.Although overall inflation is low, since summer we have seen significant increases in some highly visible prices, including those of gasoline and other commodities. Notably, in the past few weeks, concerns about unrest in the Middle East and North Africa and the possible effects on global oil supplies have led oil and gasoline prices to rise further. More broadly, the increases in commodity prices in recent months have largely reflected rising global demand for raw materials, particularly in some fast-growing emerging market economies, coupled with constraints on global supply in some cases. Commodity prices have risen significantly in terms of all major currencies, suggesting that changes in the foreign exchange value of the dollar are unlikely to have been an important driver of the increases seen in recent months.The rate of pass-through from commodity price increases to broad indexes of U.S. consumer prices has been quite low in recent decades, partly reflecting the relatively small weight of materials inputs in total production costs as well as the stability of longer-term inflation expectations. Currently, the cost pressures from higher commodity prices are also being offset by the stability in unit labor costs. Thus, the most likely outcome is that the recent rise in commodity prices will lead to, at most, a temporary and relatively modest increase in U.S. consumer price inflation--an outlook consistent with the projections of both FOMC participants and most private forecasters. That said, sustained rises in the prices of oil or other commodities would represent a threat both to economic growth and to overall price stability, particularly if they were to cause inflation expectations to become less well anchored. We will continue to monitor these developments closely and are prepared to respond as necessary to best support the ongoing recovery in a context of price stability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"As I noted earlier, the pace of recovery slowed last spring--to a rate that, if sustained, would have been insufficient to make meaningful progress against unemployment. With job creation stalling, concerns about the sustainability of the recovery increased. At the same time, inflation--already at very low levels--continued to drift downward, and market-based measures of inflation compensation moved lower as investors appeared to become more concerned about the possibility of deflation, or falling prices.Under such conditions, the Federal Reserve would normally ease monetary policy by reducing the target for its short-term policy interest rate, the federal funds rate. However, the target range for the federal funds rate has been near zero since December 2008, and the Federal Reserve has indicated that economic conditions are likely to warrant an exceptionally low target rate for an extended period. Consequently, another means of providing monetary accommodation has been necessary since that time. In particular, over the past two years the Federal Reserve has eased monetary conditions by purchasing longer-term Treasury securities, agency debt, and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) on the open market. The largest program of purchases, which lasted from December 2008 through March 2010, appears to have contributed to an improvement in financial conditions and a strengthening of the recovery. Notably, the substantial expansion of the program announced in March 2009 was followed by financial and economic stabilization and a significant pickup in the growth of economic activity in the second half of that year.In August 2010, in response to the already-mentioned concerns about the sustainability of the recovery and the continuing declines in inflation to very low levels, the FOMC authorized a policy of reinvesting principal payments on our holdings of agency debt and agency MBS into longer-term Treasury securities. By reinvesting agency securities, rather than allowing them to continue to run off as our previous policy had dictated, the FOMC ensured that a high level of monetary accommodation would be maintained. Over subsequent weeks, Federal Reserve officials noted in public remarks that we were considering providing additional monetary accommodation through further asset purchases. In November, the Committee announced that it intended to purchase an additional $600 billion in longer-term Treasury securities by the middle of this year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Large-scale purchases of longer-term securities are a less familiar means of providing monetary policy stimulus than reducing the federal funds rate, but the two approaches affect the economy in similar ways. Conventional monetary policy easing works by lowering market expectations for the future path of short-term interest rates, which, in turn, reduces the current level of longer-term interest rates and contributes to both lower borrowing costs and higher asset prices. This easing in financial conditions bolsters household and business spending and thus increases economic activity. By comparison, the Federal Reserve's purchases of longer-term securities, by lowering term premiums, put downward pressure directly on longer-term interest rates. By easing conditions in credit and financial markets, these actions encourage spending by households and businesses through essentially the same channels as conventional monetary policy.A wide range of market indicators supports the view that the Federal Reserve's recent actions have been effective. For example, since August, when we announced our policy of reinvesting principal payments on agency debt and agency MBS and indicated that we were considering more securities purchases, equity prices have risen significantly, volatility in the equity market has fallen, corporate bond spreads have narrowed, and inflation compensation as measured in the market for inflation-indexed securities has risen to historically more normal levels. Yields on 5- to 10-year nominal Treasury securities initially declined markedly as markets priced in prospective Fed purchases; these yields subsequently rose, however, as investors became more optimistic about economic growth and as traders scaled back their expectations of future securities purchases. All of these developments are what one would expect to see when monetary policy becomes more accommodative, whether through conventional or less conventional means. Interestingly, these market responses are almost identical to those that occurred during the earlier episode of policy easing, notably in the months following our March 2009 announcement. In addition, as I already noted, most forecasters see the economic outlook as having improved since our actions in August; downside risks to the recovery have receded, and the risk of deflation has become negligible. Of course, it is too early to make any firm judgment about how much of the recent improvement in the outlook can be attributed to monetary policy, but these developments are consistent with it having had a beneficial effect.My colleagues and I continue to regularly review the asset purchase program in light of incoming information, and we will adjust it as needed to promote the achievement of our mandate from the Congress of maximum employment and stable prices. We also continue to plan for the eventual exit from unusually accommodative monetary policies and the normalization of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. We have all the tools we need to achieve a smooth and effective exit at the appropriate time. Currently, because the Federal Reserve's asset purchases are settled through the banking system, depository institutions hold a very high level of reserve balances with the Federal Reserve. Even if bank reserves remain high, however, our ability to pay interest on reserve balances will allow us to put upward pressure on short-term market interest rates and thus to tighten monetary policy when required. Moreover, we have developed and tested additional tools that will allow us to drain or immobilize bank reserves to the extent needed to tighten the relationship between the interest rate paid on reserves and other short-term interest rates.5 If necessary, the Federal Reserve can also drain reserves by ceasing the reinvestment of principal payments on the securities it holds or by selling some of those securities in the open market. The FOMC remains unwaveringly committed to price stability and, in particular, to achieving a rate of inflation in the medium term that is consistent with the Federal Reserve's mandate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The Congress established the Federal Reserve, set its monetary policy objectives, and provided it with operational independence to pursue those objectives. The Federal Reserve's operational independence is critical, as it allows the FOMC to make monetary policy decisions based solely on the longer-term needs of the economy, not in response to short-term political pressures. Considerable evidence supports the view that countries with independent central banks enjoy better economic performance over time.However, in our democratic society, the Federal Reserve's independence brings with it the obligation to be accountable and transparent. The Congress and the public must have all the information needed to understand our decisions, to be assured of the integrity of our operations, and to be confident that our actions are consistent with the mandate given to us by the Congress.On matters related to the conduct of monetary policy, the Federal Reserve is one of the most transparent central banks in the world, making available extensive records and materials to explain its policy decisions. For example, beyond the semiannual Monetary Policy Report I am presenting today, the FOMC provides a post-meeting statement, a detailed set of minutes three weeks after each policy meeting, quarterly economic projections together with an accompanying narrative, and, with a five-year lag, a transcript of each meeting and its supporting materials. In addition, FOMC participants often discuss the economy and monetary policy in public forums, and Board members testify frequently before the Congress.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"In recent years the Federal Reserve has also substantially increased the information it provides about its operations and its balance sheet. In particular, for some time the Federal Reserve has been voluntarily providing extensive financial and operational information regarding the special credit and liquidity facilities put in place during the financial crisis, including full descriptions of the terms and conditions of each facility; monthly reports on, among other things, the types of collateral posted and the mix of participants using each facility; weekly updates about borrowings and repayments at each facility; and many other details.7 Further, on December 1, as provided by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the Federal Reserve Board posted on its public website the details of more than 21,000 individual credit and other transactions conducted to stabilize markets and support the economic recovery during the crisis. This transaction-level information demonstrated the breadth of these operations and the care that was taken to protect the interests of the taxpayer; indeed, despite the scope of these actions, the Federal Reserve has incurred no credit losses to date on any of the programs and expects no credit losses in any of the few programs that still have loans outstanding. Moreover, we are fully confident that independent assessments of these programs will show that they were highly effective in helping to stabilize financial markets, thus strengthening the economy. Overall, the operational effectiveness of the programs was recently supported as part of a comprehensive review of six lending facilities by the Board's independent Office of Inspector General.8 In addition, we have been working closely with the Government Accountability Office, the Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the Congressional Oversight Panel, the Congress, and private-sector auditors on reviews of these facilities as well as a range of matters relating to the Federal Reserve's operations and governance. We will continue to seek ways of enhancing our transparency without compromising our ability to conduct policy in the public interest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Although the recession officially began more than two years ago, U.S. economic activity contracted particularly sharply following the intensification of the global financial crisis in the fall of 2008. Concerted efforts by the Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department, and other U.S. authorities to stabilize the financial system, together with highly stimulative monetary and fiscal policies, helped arrest the decline and are supporting a nascent economic recovery. Indeed, the U.S. economy expanded at about a 4 percent annual rate during the second half of last year. A significant portion of that growth, however, can be attributed to the progress firms made in working down unwanted inventories of unsold goods, which left them more willing to increase production. As the impetus provided by the inventory cycle is temporary, and as the fiscal support for economic growth likely will diminish later this year, a sustained recovery will depend on continued growth in private-sector final demand for goods and services.Private final demand does seem to be growing at a moderate pace, buoyed in part by a general improvement in financial conditions. In particular, consumer spending has recently picked up, reflecting gains in real disposable income and household wealth and tentative signs of stabilization in the labor market. Business investment in equipment and software has risen significantly. And international trade--supported by a recovery in the economies of many of our trading partners--is rebounding from its deep contraction of a year ago. However, starts of single-family homes, which rose noticeably this past spring, have recently been roughly flat, and commercial construction is declining sharply, reflecting poor fundamentals and continued difficulty in obtaining financing.The job market has been hit especially hard by the recession, as employers reacted to sharp sales declines and concerns about credit availability by deeply cutting their workforces in late 2008 and in 2009. Some recent indicators suggest the deterioration in the labor market is abating: Job losses have slowed considerably, and the number of full-time jobs in manufacturing rose modestly in January. Initial claims for unemployment insurance have continued to trend lower, and the temporary services industry, often considered a bellwether for the employment outlook, has been expanding steadily since October. Notwithstanding these positive signs, the job market remains quite weak, with the unemployment rate near 10 percent and job openings scarce. Of particular concern, because of its long-term implications for workers' skills and wages, is the increasing incidence of long-term unemployment; indeed, more than 40 percent of the unemployed have been out of work six months or more, nearly double the share of a year ago.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Increases in energy prices resulted in a pickup in consumer price inflation in the second half of last year, but oil prices have flattened out over recent months, and most indicators suggest that inflation likely will be subdued for some time. Slack in labor and product markets has reduced wage and price pressures in most markets, and sharp increases in productivity have further reduced producers' unit labor costs. The cost of shelter, which receives a heavy weight in consumer price indexes, is rising very slowly, reflecting high vacancy rates. In addition, according to most measures, longer-term inflation expectations have remained relatively stable.The improvement in financial markets that began last spring continues. Conditions in short-term funding markets have returned to near pre-crisis levels. Many (mostly larger) firms have been able to issue corporate bonds or new equity and do not seem to be hampered by a lack of credit. In contrast, bank lending continues to contract, reflecting both tightened lending standards and weak demand for credit amid uncertain economic prospects.In conjunction with the January meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), Board members and Reserve Bank presidents prepared projections for economic growth, unemployment, and inflation for the years 2010 through 2012 and over the longer run. The contours of these forecasts are broadly similar to those I reported to the Congress last July. FOMC participants continue to anticipate a moderate pace of economic recovery, with economic growth of roughly 3 to 3-1/2 percent in 2010 and 3-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent in 2011. Consistent with moderate economic growth, participants expect the unemployment rate to decline only slowly, to a range of roughly 6-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent by the end of 2012, still well above their estimate of the long-run sustainable rate of about 5 percent. Inflation is expected to remain subdued, with consumer prices rising at rates between 1 and 2 percent in 2010 through 2012. In the longer term, inflation is expected to be between 1-3/4 and 2 percent, the range that most FOMC participants judge to be consistent with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Over the past year, the Federal Reserve has employed a wide array of tools to promote economic recovery and preserve price stability. The target for the federal funds rate has been maintained at a historically low range of 0 to 1/4 percent since December 2008. The FOMC continues to anticipate that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.To provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve is in the process of purchasing $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and about $175 billion of agency debt. We have been gradually slowing the pace of these purchases in order to promote a smooth transition in markets and anticipate that these transactions will be completed by the end of March. The FOMC will continue to evaluate its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.In response to the substantial improvements in the functioning of most financial markets, the Federal Reserve is winding down the special liquidity facilities it created during the crisis. On February 1, a number of these facilities, including credit facilities for primary dealers, lending programs intended to help stabilize money market mutual funds and the commercial paper market, and temporary liquidity swap lines with foreign central banks, were allowed to expire.1 The only remaining lending program for multiple borrowers created under the Federal Reserve's emergency authorities, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, is scheduled to close on March 31 for loans backed by all types of collateral except newly issued commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) and on June 30 for loans backed by newly issued CMBS.In addition to closing its special facilities, the Federal Reserve is normalizing its lending to commercial banks through the discount window. The final auction of discount-window funds to depositories through the Term Auction Facility, which was created in the early stages of the crisis to improve the liquidity of the banking system, will occur on March 8. Last week we announced that the maximum term of discount window loans, which was increased to as much as 90 days during the crisis, would be returned to overnight for most banks, as it was before the crisis erupted in August 2007. To discourage banks from relying on the discount window rather than private funding markets for short-term credit, last week we also increased the discount rate by 25 basis points, raising the spread between the discount rate and the top of the target range for the federal funds rate to 50 basis points. These changes, like the closure of most of the special lending facilities earlier this month, are in response to the improved functioning of financial markets, which has reduced the need for extraordinary assistance from the Federal Reserve. These adjustments are not expected to lead to tighter financial conditions for households and businesses and should not be interpreted as signaling any change in the outlook for monetary policy, which remains about the same as it was at the time of the January meeting of the FOMC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Although the federal funds rate is likely to remain exceptionally low for an extended period, as the expansion matures, the Federal Reserve will at some point need to begin to tighten monetary conditions to prevent the development of inflationary pressures. Notwithstanding the substantial increase in the size of its balance sheet associated with its purchases of Treasury and agency securities, we are confident that we have the tools we need to firm the stance of monetary policy at the appropriate time.Most importantly, in October 2008 the Congress gave statutory authority to the Federal Reserve to pay interest on banks' holdings of reserve balances at Federal Reserve Banks. By increasing the interest rate on reserves, the Federal Reserve will be able to put significant upward pressure on all short-term interest rates. Actual and prospective increases in short-term interest rates will be reflected in turn in longer-term interest rates and in financial conditions more generally.The Federal Reserve has also been developing a number of additional tools to reduce the large quantity of reserves held by the banking system, which will improve the Federal Reserve's control of financial conditions by leading to a tighter relationship between the interest rate paid on reserves and other short-term interest rates. Notably, our operational capacity for conducting reverse repurchase agreements, a tool that the Federal Reserve has historically used to absorb reserves from the banking system, is being expanded so that such transactions can be used to absorb large quantities of reserves.3 The Federal Reserve is also currently refining plans for a term deposit facility that could convert a portion of depository institutions' holdings of reserve balances into deposits that are less liquid and could not be used to meet reserve requirements.4 In addition, the FOMC has the option of redeeming or selling securities as a means of reducing outstanding bank reserves and applying monetary restraint. Of course, the sequencing of steps and the combination of tools that the Federal Reserve uses as it exits from its currently very accommodative policy stance will depend on economic and financial developments. I provided more discussion of these options and possible sequencing in a recent testimony.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The Federal Reserve is committed to ensuring that the Congress and the public have all the information needed to understand our decisions and to be assured of the integrity of our operations. Indeed, on matters related to the conduct of monetary policy, the Federal Reserve is already one of the most transparent central banks in the world, providing detailed records and explanations of its decisions. Over the past year, the Federal Reserve also took a number of steps to enhance the transparency of its special credit and liquidity facilities, including the provision of regular, extensive reports to the Congress and the public; and we have worked closely with the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the Congress, and private-sector auditors on a range of matters relating to these facilities.While the emergency credit and liquidity facilities were important tools for implementing monetary policy during the crisis, we understand that the unusual nature of those facilities creates a special obligation to assure the Congress and the public of the integrity of their operation. Accordingly, we would welcome a review by the GAO of the Federal Reserve's management of all facilities created under emergency authorities.6 In particular, we would support legislation authorizing the GAO to audit the operational integrity, collateral policies, use of third-party contractors, accounting, financial reporting, and internal controls of these special credit and liquidity facilities. The Federal Reserve will, of course, cooperate fully and actively in all reviews. We are also prepared to support legislation that would require the release of the identities of the firms that participated in each special facility after an appropriate delay. It is important that the release occur after a lag that is sufficiently long that investors will not view an institution's use of one of the facilities as a possible indication of ongoing financial problems, thereby undermining market confidence in the institution or discouraging use of any future facility that might become necessary to protect the U.S. economy. An appropriate delay would also allow firms adequate time to inform investors through annual reports and other public documents of their use of Federal Reserve facilities.Looking ahead, we will continue to work with the Congress in identifying approaches for enhancing the Federal Reserve's transparency that are consistent with our statutory objectives of fostering maximum employment and price stability. In particular, it is vital that the conduct of monetary policy continue to be insulated from short-term political pressures so that the FOMC can make policy decisions in the longer-term economic interests of the American people. Moreover, the confidentiality of discount window lending to individual depository institutions must be maintained so that the Federal Reserve continues to have effective ways to provide liquidity to depository institutions under circumstances where other sources of funding are not available. The Federal Reserve's ability to inject liquidity into the financial system is critical for preserving financial stability and for supporting depositories' key role in meeting the ongoing credit needs of firms and households.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Strengthening our financial regulatory system is essential for the long-term economic stability of the nation. Among the lessons of the crisis are the crucial importance of macroprudential regulation--that is, regulation and supervision aimed at addressing risks to the financial system as a whole--and the need for effective consolidated supervision of every financial institution that is so large or interconnected that its failure could threaten the functioning of the entire financial system.The Federal Reserve strongly supports the Congress's ongoing efforts to achieve comprehensive financial reform. In the meantime, to strengthen the Federal Reserve's oversight of banking organizations, we have been conducting an intensive self-examination of our regulatory and supervisory responsibilities and have been actively implementing improvements. For example, the Federal Reserve has been playing a key role in international efforts to toughen capital and liquidity requirements for financial institutions, particularly systemically critical firms, and we have been taking the lead in ensuring that compensation structures at banking organizations provide appropriate incentives without encouraging excessive risk-taking.The Federal Reserve is also making fundamental changes in its supervision of large, complex bank holding companies, both to improve the effectiveness of consolidated supervision and to incorporate a macroprudential perspective that goes beyond the traditional focus on safety and soundness of individual institutions. We are overhauling our supervisory framework and procedures to improve coordination within our own supervisory staff and with other supervisory agencies and to facilitate more-integrated assessments of risks within each holding company and across groups of companies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Last spring the Federal Reserve led the successful Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, popularly known as the bank stress tests. An important lesson of that program was that combining on-site bank examinations with a suite of quantitative and analytical tools can greatly improve comparability of the results and better identify potential risks. In that spirit, the Federal Reserve is also in the process of developing an enhanced quantitative surveillance program for large bank holding companies. Supervisory information will be combined with firm-level, market-based indicators and aggregate economic data to provide a more complete picture of the risks facing these institutions and the broader financial system. Making use of the Federal Reserve's unparalleled breadth of expertise, this program will apply a multidisciplinary approach that involves economists, specialists in particular financial markets, payments systems experts, and other professionals, as well as bank supervisors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The recent crisis has also underscored the extent to which direct involvement in the oversight of banks and bank holding companies contributes to the Federal Reserve's effectiveness in carrying out its responsibilities as a central bank, including the making of monetary policy and the management of the discount window. Most important, as the crisis has once again demonstrated, the Federal Reserve's ability to identify and address diverse and hard-to-predict threats to financial stability depends critically on the information, expertise, and powers that it has by virtue of being both a bank supervisor and a central bank.The Federal Reserve continues to demonstrate its commitment to strengthening consumer protections in the financial services arena. Since the time of the previous Monetary Policy Report in July, the Federal Reserve has proposed a comprehensive overhaul of the regulations governing consumer mortgage transactions, and we are collaborating with the Department of Housing and Urban Development to assess how we might further increase transparency in the mortgage process.8 We have issued rules implementing enhanced consumer protections for credit card accounts and private student loans as well as new rules to ensure that consumers have meaningful opportunities to avoid overdraft fees.9 In addition, the Federal Reserve has implemented an expanded consumer compliance supervision program for nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies and foreign banking organizations",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Chairman Frank, Ranking Member Bachus, and other members of the Committee, I am pleased to present the Federal Reserve's Monetary Policy Report to the Congress.  In my testimony this morning I will briefly review the economic situation and outlook, beginning with developments in real activity and inflation, then turn to monetary policy.  I will conclude with a quick update on the Federal Reserve's recent actions to help protect consumers in their financial dealings.The economic situation has become distinctly less favorable since the time of our July report.  Strains in financial markets, which first became evident late last summer, have persisted; and pressures on bank capital and the continued poor functioning of markets for securitized credit have led to tighter credit conditions for many households and businesses.  The growth of real gross domestic product (GDP) held up well through the third quarter despite the financial turmoil, but it has since slowed sharply.  Labor market conditions have similarly softened, as job creation has slowed and the unemployment rate--at 4.9 percent in January--has moved up somewhat.Many of the challenges now facing our economy stem from the continuing contraction of the U.S. housing market.  In 2006, after a multiyear boom in residential construction and house prices, the housing market reversed course.  Housing starts and sales of new homes are now less than half of their respective peaks, and house prices have flattened or declined in most areas.  Changes in the availability of mortgage credit amplified the swings in the housing market.  During the housing sector's expansion phase, increasingly lax lending standards, particularly in the subprime market, raised the effective demand for housing, pushing up prices and stimulating construction activity.  As the housing market began to turn down, however, the slump in subprime mortgage originations, together with a more general tightening of credit conditions, has served to increase the severity of the downturn.  Weaker house prices in turn have contributed to the deterioration in the performance of mortgage-related securities and reduced the availability of mortgage credit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The housing market is expected to continue to weigh on economic activity in coming quarters.  Homebuilders, still faced with abnormally high inventories of unsold homes, are likely to cut the pace of their building activity further, which will subtract from overall growth and reduce employment in residential construction and closely related industries.Consumer spending continued to increase at a solid pace through much of the second half of 2007, despite the problems in the housing market, but it appears to have slowed significantly toward the end of the year.  The jump in the price of imported energy, which eroded real incomes and wages, likely contributed to the slowdown in spending, as did the declines in household wealth associated with the weakness in house prices and equity prices.  Slowing job creation is yet another potential drag on household spending, as gains in payroll employment averaged little more than 40,000 per month during the three months ending in January, compared with an average increase of almost 100,000 per month over the previous three months.  However, the recently enacted fiscal stimulus package should provide some support for household spending during the second half of this year and into next year.The business sector has also displayed signs of being affected by the difficulties in the housing and credit markets.  Reflecting a downshift in the growth of final demand and tighter credit conditions for some firms, available indicators suggest that investment in equipment and software will be subdued during the first half of 2008.  Likewise, after growing robustly through much of 2007, nonresidential construction is likely to decelerate sharply in coming quarters as business activity slows and funding becomes harder to obtain, especially for more speculative projects.  On a more encouraging note, we see few signs of any serious imbalances in business inventories aside from the overhang of unsold homes.  And, as a whole, the nonfinancial business sector remains in good financial condition, with strong profits, liquid balance sheets, and corporate leverage near historical lows.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"In addition, the vigor of the global economy has offset some of the weakening of domestic demand.  U.S. real exports of goods and services increased at an annual rate of about 11 percent in the second half of last year, boosted by continuing economic growth abroad and the lower foreign exchange value of the dollar.  Strengthening exports, together with moderating imports, have in turn led to some improvement in the U.S. current account deficit, which likely narrowed in 2007 (on an annual basis) for the first time since 2001.  Although recent indicators point to some slowing of foreign economic growth, U.S. exports should continue to expand at a healthy pace in coming quarters, providing some impetus to domestic economic activity and employment.As I have mentioned, financial markets continue to be under considerable stress.  Heightened investor concerns about the credit quality of mortgages, especially subprime mortgages with adjustable interest rates, triggered the financial turmoil.  However, other factors, including a broader retrenchment in the willingness of investors to bear risk, difficulties in valuing complex or illiquid financial products, uncertainties about the exposures of major financial institutions to credit losses, and concerns about the weaker outlook for economic growth, have also roiled the financial markets in recent months.  To help relieve the pressures in the market for interbank lending, the Federal Reserve--among other actions--recently introduced a term auction facility (TAF), through which prespecified amounts of discount window credit are auctioned to eligible borrowers, and we have been working with other central banks to address market strains that could hamper the achievement of our broader economic objectives.  These efforts appear to have contributed to some improvement in short-term funding markets.  We will continue to monitor financial developments closely.As part of its ongoing commitment to improving the accountability and public understanding of monetary policy making, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) recently increased the frequency and expanded the content of the economic projections made by Federal Reserve Board members and Reserve Bank presidents and released to the public.  The latest economic projections, which were submitted in conjunction with the FOMC meeting at the end of January and which are based on each participant's assessment of appropriate monetary policy, show that real GDP was expected to grow only sluggishly in the next few quarters and that the unemployment rate was seen as likely to increase somewhat.  In particular, the central tendency of the projections was for real GDP to grow between 1.3 percent and 2.0 percent in 2008, down from 2-1/2 percent to 2-3/4 percent projected in our report last July.  FOMC participants' projections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2008 have a central tendency of 5.2 percent to 5.3 percent, up from the level of about 4-3/4 percent projected last July for the same period.  The downgrade in our projections for economic activity in 2008 since our report last July reflects the effects of the financial turmoil on real activity and a housing contraction that has been more severe than previously expected.  By 2010, our most recent projections show output growth picking up to rates close to or a little above its longer-term trend and the unemployment rate edging lower; the improvement reflects the effects of policy stimulus and an anticipated moderation of the contraction in housing and the strains in financial and credit markets.  The incoming information since our January meeting continues to suggest sluggish economic activity in the near term.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The risks to this outlook remain to the downside.  The risks include the possibilities that the housing market or labor market may deteriorate more than is currently anticipated and that credit conditions may tighten substantially further.Consumer price inflation has increased since our previous report, in substantial part because of the steep run-up in the price of oil.  Last year, food prices also increased significantly, and the dollar depreciated.  Reflecting these influences, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) increased 3.4 percent over the four quarters of 2007, up from 1.9 percent in 2006.  Core price inflation--that is, inflation excluding food and energy prices--also firmed toward the end of the year.  The higher recent readings likely reflected some pass-through of energy costs to the prices of core consumer goods and services as well as the effect of the depreciation of the dollar on import prices.  Moreover, core inflation in the first half of 2007 was damped by a number of transitory factors--notably, unusually soft prices for apparel and for financial services--which subsequently reversed.  For the year as a whole, however, core PCE prices increased 2.1 percent, down slightly from 2006.The projections recently submitted by FOMC participants indicate that overall PCE inflation was expected to moderate significantly in 2008, to between 2.1 percent and 2.4 percent (the central tendency of the projections).  A key assumption underlying those projections was that energy and food prices would begin to flatten out, as was implied by quotes on futures markets.  In addition, diminishing pressure on resources is also consistent with the projected slowing in inflation.  The central tendency of the projections for core PCE inflation in 2008, at 2.0 percent to 2.2 percent, was a bit higher than in our July report, largely because of some higher-than-expected recent readings on prices.  Beyond 2008, both overall and core inflation were projected to edge lower, as participants expected inflation expectations to remain reasonably well-anchored and pressures on resource utilization to be muted.  The inflation projections submitted by FOMC participants for 2010--which ranged from 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent for overall PCE inflation--were importantly influenced by participants' judgments about the measured rates of inflation consistent with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate and about the time frame over which policy should aim to attain those rates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The rate of inflation that is actually realized will of course depend on a variety of factors.  Inflation could be lower than we anticipate if slower-than-expected global growth moderates the pressure on the prices of energy and other commodities or if rates of domestic resource utilization fall more than we currently expect.  Upside risks to the inflation projection are also present, however, including the possibilities that energy and food prices do not flatten out or that the pass-through to core prices from higher commodity prices and from the weaker dollar may be greater than we anticipate.  Indeed, the further increases in the prices of energy and other commodities in recent weeks, together with the latest data on consumer prices, suggest slightly greater upside risks to the projections of both overall and core inflation than we saw last month.  Should high rates of overall inflation persist, the possibility also exists that inflation expectations could become less well anchored.  Any tendency of inflation expectations to become unmoored or for the Fed's inflation-fighting credibility to be eroded could greatly complicate the task of sustaining price stability and could reduce the flexibility of the FOMC to counter shortfalls in growth in the future.  Accordingly, in the months ahead, the Federal Reserve will continue to monitor closely inflation and inflation expectations.Let me turn now to the implications of these developments for monetary policy.  The FOMC has responded aggressively to the weaker outlook for economic activity, having reduced its target for the federal funds rate by 225 basis points since last summer.  As the Committee noted in its most recent post-meeting statement, the intent of those actions has been to help promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate the risks to economic activity.A critical task for the Federal Reserve over the course of this year will be to assess whether the stance of monetary policy is properly calibrated to foster our mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability in an environment of downside risks to growth, stressed financial conditions, and inflation pressures.  In particular, the FOMC will need to judge whether the policy actions taken thus far are having their intended effects.  Monetary policy works with a lag.  Therefore, our policy stance must be determined in light of the medium-term forecast for real activity and inflation as well as the risks to that forecast.  Although the FOMC participants' economic projections envision an improving economic picture, it is important to recognize that downside risks to growth remain.  The FOMC will be carefully evaluating incoming information bearing on the economic outlook and will act in a timely manner as needed to support growth and to provide adequate insurance against downside risks.Finally, I would like to say a few words about the Federal Reserve's recent actions to protect consumers in their financial transactions.  In December, following up on a commitment I made at the time of our report last July, the Board issued for public comment a comprehensive set of new regulations to prohibit unfair or deceptive practices in the mortgage market, under the authority granted us by the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994.  The proposed rules would apply to all mortgage lenders and would establish lending standards to help ensure that consumers who seek mortgage credit receive loans whose terms are clearly disclosed and that can reasonably be expected to be repaid.  Accordingly, the rules would prohibit lenders from engaging in a pattern or practice of making higher-priced mortgage loans without due regard to consumers' ability to make the scheduled payments.  In each case, a lender making a higher-priced loan would have to use third-party documents to verify the income relied on to make the credit decision.  For higher-priced loans, the proposed rules would require the lender to establish an escrow account for the payment of property taxes and homeowners' insurance and would prevent the use of prepayment penalties in circumstances where they might trap borrowers in unaffordable loans.  In addition, for all mortgage loans, our proposal addresses misleading and deceptive advertising practices, requires borrowers and brokers to agree in advance on the maximum fee that the broker may receive, bans certain practices by servicers that harm borrowers, and prohibits coercion of appraisers by lenders.  We expect substantial public comment on our proposal, and we will carefully consider all information and viewpoints while moving expeditiously to adopt final rules.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The effectiveness of the new regulations, however, will depend critically on strong enforcement.  To that end, in conjunction with other federal and state agencies, we are conducting compliance reviews of a range of mortgage lenders, including nondepository lenders.  The agencies will collaborate in determining the lessons learned and in seeking ways to better cooperate in ensuring effective and consistent examinations of, and improved enforcement for, all categories of mortgage lenders.The Federal Reserve continues to work with financial institutions, public officials, and community groups around the country to help homeowners avoid foreclosures.  We have called on mortgage lenders and servicers to pursue prudent loan workouts and have supported the development of streamlined, systematic approaches to expedite the loan modification process.  We also have been providing community groups, counseling agencies, regulators, and others with detailed analyses to help identify neighborhoods at high risk from foreclosures so that local outreach efforts to help troubled borrowers can be as focused and effective as possible.  We are actively pursuing other ways to leverage the Federal Reserve's analytical resources, regional presence, and community connections to address this critical issue.In addition to our consumer protection efforts in the mortgage area, we are working toward finalizing rules under the Truth in Lending Act that will require new, more informative, and consumer-tested disclosures by credit card issuers.  Separately, we are actively reviewing potentially unfair and deceptive practices by issuers of credit cards.  Using the Board's authority under the Federal Trade Commission Act, we expect to issue proposed rules regarding these practices this spring.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The U.S. economy performed impressively in 2005. Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased a bit more than 3 percent, building on the sustained expansion that gained traction in the middle of 2003. Payroll employment rose 2 million in 2005, and the unemployment rate fell below 5 percent. Productivity continued to advance briskly.The economy achieved these gains despite some significant obstacles. Energy prices rose substantially yet again, in response to increasing global demand, hurricane-related disruptions to production, and concerns about the adequacy and reliability of supply. The Gulf Coast region suffered through severe hurricanes that inflicted a terrible loss of life; destroyed homes, personal property, businesses, and infrastructure on a massive scale; and displaced more than a million people. The storms also damaged facilities and disrupted production in many industries, with substantial effects on the energy and petrochemical sectors and on the region's ports. Full recovery in the affected areas is likely to be slow. The hurricanes left an imprint on aggregate economic activity as well, seen, in part, in the marked deceleration of real GDP in the fourth quarter. However, the most recent evidence--including indicators of production, the flow of new orders to businesses, weekly data on initial claims for unemployment insurance, and the payroll employment and retail sales figures for January--suggests that the economic expansion remains on track.Inflation pressures increased in 2005. Steeply rising energy prices pushed up overall inflation, raised business costs, and squeezed household budgets. Nevertheless, the increase in prices for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, at just below 2 percent, remained moderate, and longer-term inflation expectations appear to have been contained.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"With the economy expanding at a solid pace, resource utilization rising, cost pressures increasing, and short-term interest rates still relatively low, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) over the course of 2005 continued the process of removing monetary policy accommodation, raising the federal funds rate 2 percentage points in eight increments of 25 basis points each. At its meeting on January 31 of this year, the FOMC raised the federal funds rate another 1/4 percentage point, bringing its level to 4-1/2 percent.At that meeting_ monetary policymakers also discussed the economic outlook for the next two years. The central tendency of the forecasts of members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of Federal Reserve Banks is for real GDP to increase about 3-1/2 percent in 2006 and 3 percent to 3-1/2 percent in 2007. The civilian unemployment rate is expected to finish both 2006 and 2007 at a level between 4-3/4 percent and 5 percent. Inflation, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, is predicted to be about 2 percent this year and 1-3/4 percent to 2 percent next year. While considerable uncertainty surrounds any economic forecast extending nearly two years, I am comfortable with these projections.In the announcement following the January 31 meeting, the Federal Reserve pointed to risks that could add to inflation pressures. Among those risks is the possibility that, to an extent greater than we now anticipate, higher energy prices may pass through into the prices of non-energy goods and services or have a persistent effect on inflation expectations. Another factor bearing on the inflation outlook is that the economy now appears to be operating at a relatively high level of resource utilization. Gauging the economy's sustainable potential is difficult, and the Federal Reserve will keep a close eye on all the relevant evidence and be flexible in making those judgments. Nevertheless, the risk exists that, with aggregate demand exhibiting considerable momentum, output could overshoot its sustainable path, leading ultimately--in the absence of countervailing monetary policy action--to further upward pressure on inflation. In these circumstances, the FOMC judged that some further firming of monetary policy may be necessary, an assessment with which I concur.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Not all of the risks to the economy concern inflation. For example, a number of indicators point to a slowing in the housing market. Some cooling of the housing market is to be expected and would not be inconsistent with continued solid growth of overall economic activity. However, given the substantial gains in house prices and the high levels of home construction activity over the past several years, prices and construction could decelerate more rapidly than currently seems likely. Slower growth in home equity, in turn, might lead households to boost their saving and trim their spending relative to current income by more than is now anticipated. The possibility of significant further increases in energy prices represents an additional risk to the economy; besides affecting inflation, such increases might also hurt consumer confidence and thereby reduce spending on non-energy goods and services.Although the outlook contains significant uncertainties, it is clear that substantial progress has been made in removing monetary policy accommodation. As a consequence, in coming quarters the FOMC will have to make ongoing, provisional judgments about the risks to both inflation and growth, and monetary policy actions will be increasingly dependent on incoming data.In assessing the prospects for the economy, some appreciation of recent circumstances is essential, so let me now review key developments of 2005 and discuss their implications for the outlook. The household sector was a mainstay of the economic expansion again last year, and household spending is likely to remain an important source of growth in aggregate demand in 2006. The growth in household spending last year was supported by rising employment and moderate increases in wages. Expenditures were buoyed as well by significant gains in household wealth that reflected further increases in home values and in broad equity prices. However, sharply rising bills for gasoline and heating reduced the amount of income available for spending on other consumer goods and services.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Residential investment also expanded considerably in 2005, supported by a strong real estate market. However, as I have already noted, some signs of slowing in the housing market have appeared in recent months: Home sales have softened, the inventory of unsold homes has risen, and indicators of homebuilder and homebuyer sentiment have turned down. Anecdotal information suggests that homes typically are on the market somewhat longer than they were a year or so ago, and the frequency of contract offers above asking prices reportedly has diminished. Financial market conditions seem to be consistent with some moderation in housing activity. Interest rates on thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages, which were around 5-3/4 percent over much of 2005, rose noticeably in the final months of the year to their current level of around 6-1/4 percent. Rates on adjustable-rate mortgages have climbed more considerably. Still, despite the recent increases, mortgage rates remain relatively low. Low mortgage rates, together with expanding payrolls and incomes and the need to rebuild after the hurricanes, should continue to support the housing market. Thus, at this point, a leveling out or a modest softening of housing activity seems more likely than a sharp contraction, although significant uncertainty attends the outlook for home prices and construction. In any case, the Federal Reserve will continue to monitor this sector closely.Overall, the financial health of households appears reasonably good. Largely reflecting the growth in home mortgages, total household debt continued to expand rapidly in 2005. But the value of household assets also continued to climb strongly, driven by gains in home prices and equity shares. To some extent, sizable increases in household wealth, as well as low interest rates, have contributed in recent years to the low level of personal saving. Saving last year was probably further depressed by the rise in households' energy bills. Over the next few years, saving relative to income is likely to rise somewhat from its recent low level.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"In the business sector, profits continued to rise last year at a solid pace, boosted in part by continuing advances in productivity. Strong corporate balance sheets combined with expanding sales and favorable conditions in financial markets fostered a solid increase in spending on equipment and software last year. Investment in high-tech equipment rebounded, its increase spurred by further declines in the prices of high-tech goods. Expenditures for communications equipment, which had fallen off earlier this decade, showed particular strength for the year as a whole. In contrast, nonresidential construction activity remained soft.Although the financial condition of the business sector is generally quite strong, several areas of structural weakness are evident, notably in the automobile and airline industries. Despite these problems, however, favorable conditions in the business sector as a whole should encourage continued expansion of capital investment.For the most part, the financial situation of state and local governments has improved noticeably over the past couple of years. Rising personal and business incomes have buoyed tax revenues, affording some scope for increases in state and local government expenditures. At the federal level, the budget deficit narrowed appreciably in fiscal 2005. Outlays rose rapidly, but receipts climbed even more sharply as the economy expanded. However, defense expenditures, hurricane relief, and increasing entitlement costs seem likely to worsen the deficit in fiscal 2006.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Outside the United States, economic activity strengthened last year, and at present global growth seems to be on a good track. The economies of our North American neighbors, Canada and Mexico, appear to be expanding at a solid pace. Especially significant have been signs that Japan could be emerging from its protracted slump and its battle with deflation. In the euro area, expansion has been somewhat modest by global standards, but recent indicators suggest that growth could be strengthening there as well. Economies in emerging Asia generally continue to expand strongly. In particular, growth in China remained vigorous in 2005.Expanding foreign economic activity helped drive a vigorous advance in U.S. exports in 2005, while the growth of real imports slowed. Nonetheless, the nominal U.S. trade deficit increased further last year, exacerbated in part by a jump in the value of imported petroleum products that almost wholly reflected the sharply rising price of crude oil.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Surging energy prices also were the dominant factor influencing U.S. inflation last year. For the second year in a row, overall consumer prices, as measured by the chain-type index for personal consumption expenditures, rose about 3 percent. Prices of consumer energy products jumped more than 20 percent, with large increases in prices of natural gas, gasoline, and fuel oil. Food prices, however, rose only modestly. And core consumer prices (that is, excluding food and energy) increased a moderate 1.9 percent.The relatively benign performance of core inflation despite the steep increases in energy prices can be attributed to several factors. Over the past few decades, the U.S. economy has become significantly less energy intensive. Also, rapid advances in productivity as well as increases in nominal wages and salaries that, on balance, have been moderate have restrained unit labor costs in recent years.Another key factor in keeping core inflation low has been confidence on the part of the public and investors in the prospects for price stability. Maintaining expectations of low and stable inflation is an essential element in the Federal Reserve's effort to promote price stability. And, thus far, the news has been good: Survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations have responded only a little to the larger fluctuations in energy prices that we have experienced, and for the most part, they were low and stable last year. Inflation compensation for the period five to ten years ahead, derived from spreads between nominal and inflation-indexed Treasury securities, has remained well anchored.Restrained inflation expectations have also been an important reason that long-term interest rates have remained relatively low. At roughly 4-1/2 percent at year-end, yields on ten-year nominal Treasury issues increased only slightly on balance over 2005 even as short-term rates rose 2 percentage points. As previous reports and testimonies from the Federal Reserve indicated, a decomposition of long-term nominal yields into spot and forward rates suggests that it is primarily the far-forward components that account for the low level of long rates. The premiums that investors demand as compensation for the risk of unforeseen changes in real interest rates and inflation appear to have declined significantly over the past decade or so. Given the more stable macroeconomic climate in the United States and in the global economy since the mid-1980s, some decline in risk premiums is not surprising. In addition, though, investors seem to expect real interest rates to remain relatively low. Such a view is consistent with a hypothesis I offered last year--that, in recent years, an excess of desired global saving over the quantity of global investment opportunities that pay historically normal returns has forced down the real interest rate prevailing in global capital markets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Inflation prospects are important, not just because price stability is in itself desirable and part of the Federal Reserve's mandate from the Congress, but also because price stability is essential for strong and stable growth of output and employment. Stable prices promote long-term economic growth by allowing households and firms to make economic decisions and undertake productive activities with fewer concerns about large or unanticipated changes in the price level and their attendant financial consequences. Experience shows that low and stable inflation and inflation expectations are also associated with greater short-term stability in output and employment, perhaps in part because they give the central bank greater latitude to counter transitory disturbances to the economy. Similarly, the attainment of the statutory goal of moderate long-term interest rates requires price stability, because only then are the inflation premiums that investors demand for holding long-term instruments kept to a minimum. In sum, achieving price stability is not only important in itself; it is also central to attaining the Federal Reserve's other mandated objectives of maximum sustainable employment and moderate long-term interest rates.As always, however, translating the Federal Reserve's general economic objectives into operational decisions about the stance of monetary policy poses many challenges. Over the past few decades, policymakers have learned that no single economic or financial indicator, or even a small set of such indicators, can provide reliable guidance for the setting of monetary policy.Rather, the Federal Reserve, together with all modern central banks, has found that the successful conduct of monetary policy requires painstaking examination of a broad range of economic and financial data, careful consideration of the implications of those data for the likely path of the economy and inflation, and prudent judgment regarding the effects of alternative courses of policy action on prospects for achieving our macroeconomic objectives. In that process, economic models can provide valuable guidance to policymakers, and over the years substantial progress has been made in developing formal models and forecasting techniques. But any model is by necessity a simplification of the real world, and sufficient data are seldom available to measure even the basic relationships with precision. Monetary policymakers must therefore strike a difficult balance--conducting rigorous analysis informed by sound economic theory and empirical methods while keeping an open mind about the many factors, including myriad global influences, at play in a dynamic modern economy like that of the United States. Amid significant uncertainty, we must formulate a view of the most likely course of the economy under a given policy approach while giving due weight to the potential risks and associated costs to the economy should those judgments turn out to be wrong.

other,,"Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I am pleased this morning to present the Federal Reserve's semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress. I will begin by reviewing the state of the U.S. economy and the conduct of monetary policy and then turn to some key issues related to the federal budget.When I testified before this committee last July, I noted that, while the growth of economic activity over the first half of the year had been spurred importantly by a swing from rapid inventory drawdown to modest inventory accumulation, that source of impetus would surely wind down in subsequent quarters, as it did. We at the Federal Reserve recognized that a strengthening of final sales was an essential element of putting the expansion on a firm and sustainable track. To support such a strengthening, monetary policy was set to continue its accommodative stance.In the event, final sales continued to grow only modestly, and business outlays remained soft. Concerns about corporate governance, which intensified for a time, were compounded over the late summer and into the fall by growing geopolitical tensions. In particular, worries about the situation in Iraq contributed to an appreciable increase in oil prices. These uncertainties, coupled with ongoing concerns surrounding macroeconomic prospects, heightened investors' perception of risk and, perhaps, their aversion to such risk. Equity prices weakened further, the expected volatility of equity prices rose to unusually high levels, spreads on corporate debt and credit default swaps deteriorated, and liquidity in corporate debt markets declined. The economic data and the anecdotal information suggested that firms were tightly limiting hiring and capital spending and keeping an unusually short leash on inventories.

other,,"By early November, conditions in financial markets had firmed somewhat on reports of improved corporate profitability. But on November 6, with economic performance remaining subpar, the Federal Open Market Committee chose to ease the stance of monetary policy, reducing the federal funds rate 50 basis points, to 1_ percent. We viewed that action as insurance against the possibility that the still widespread weakness would become entrenched. With inflation expectations well contained, this additional monetary stimulus seemed to offer worthwhile insurance against the threat of persistent economic weakness and unwelcome substantial declines in inflation from already low levelsIn the weeks that followed, financial market conditions continued to improve, but only haltingly. The additional monetary stimulus and the absence of further revelations of major corporate wrongdoing seemed to provide some reassurance to investors. Equity prices rose, volatility declined, risk spreads narrowed, and market liquidity increased, albeit not to levels that might be associated with robust economic conditions. At the same time, mounting concerns about geopolitical risks and energy supplies, amplified by the turmoil in Venezuela, were mirrored by the worrisome surge in oil prices, continued skittishness in financial markets, and substantial uncertainty among businesses about the outlook.Partly as a result, growth of economic activity slowed markedly late in the summer and in the fourth quarter, continuing the choppy pattern that prevailed over the past year. According to the advance estimate, real GDP expanded at an annual rate of only _ percent last quarter after surging 4 percent in the third quarter. Much of that deceleration reflected a falloff in the production of motor vehicles from the near-record level that had been reached in the third quarter when low financing rates and other incentive programs sparked a jump in sales. The slowing in aggregate output also reflected aggressive attempts by businesses more generally to ensure that inventories remained under control. Thus far, those efforts have proven successful in that business inventories, with only a few exceptions, have stayed lean--a circumstance that should help support production this year. Indeed, after dropping back a bit in the fall, manufacturing activity turned up in December, and reports from purchasing managers suggest that improvement has continued into this year. Excluding both the swings in auto and truck production and the fluctuations in non-motor-vehicle inventories, economic activity has been moving up in a considerably smoother fashion than has overall real GDP: Final sales excluding motor vehicles are estimated to have risen at a 2_ percent annual rate in the fourth quarter after a similar 1_ percent advance in the previous quarter and an average of 2 percent in the first half.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Thus, apart from these quarterly fluctuations, the economy has largely extended the broad patterns of performance that were evident at the time of my July testimony. Most notably, output has continued to expand, but only modestly. As previously, overall growth has simultaneously been supported by relatively strong spending by households and weighed down by weak expenditures by businesses. Importantly, the favorable underlying trends in productivity have continued; despite little change last quarter, output per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose 3_ percent over the four quarters of 2002, an impressive gain for a period of generally lackluster economic performance. One consequence of the combination of sluggish output growth and rapid productivity gains has been that the labor market has remained quite soft. Employment turned down in the final months of last year, and the unemployment rate moved up, but the report for January was somewhat more encouraging.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"While household spending has been reasonably vigorous, we have yet to see convincing signs of a rebound in business outlays. After having fallen sharply over the preceding two years, new orders for capital equipment stabilized and, for some categories, turned up in nominal terms in 2002. Investment in equipment and software is estimated to have risen at a 5 percent rate in real terms in the fourth quarter and a subpar 3 percent over the four quarters of the year.However, the emergence of a sustained and broad-based pickup in capital spending will almost surely require the resumption of substantial gains in corporate profits. Profit margins apparently did improve a bit last year, aided importantly by the strong growth in labor productivity.Of course, the path of capital investment will depend not only on market conditions and the prospects for profits and cash flow but also on the resolution of the uncertainties surrounding the business outlook. Indeed, the heightening of geopolitical tensions has only added to the marked uncertainties that have piled up over the past three years, creating formidable barriers to new investment and thus to a resumption of vigorous expansion of overall economic activity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Real GDP growth is expected to slow sharply to 0.5-1.5% this year.  Recovery in 2002 will depend on an upturn in external demand, particularly of the global electronics industry.  At the same time inflationary pressures are subsiding.  However, the slowdown reflects a decline in demand, not an erosion of competitiveness.  There is no reason for any persistent weakening of the Singapore dollar.MAS has therefore shifted to a neutral exchange rate policy stance, with a policy band centred on a zero percent appreciation of the S$NEER.

In 2001, Singapore's GDP growth is expected to moderate to a more sustainable rate of 5-7% in 2001, following the rapid expansion last year and in line with weakening external demand.Domestic inflationary pressures have been rising over the past year, reflecting a tightening of the labour market and the recovery in domestic demand. This will be partially offset by lower imported inflation, if oil prices decline as expected. On balance, we expect CPI inflation to be higher this year than in 2000, but to remain below 2% for the year as a whole.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

other,,"Monetary policy also belongs to the Fed¡¯s tools. The term monetary policydenotes the activities undertaken by the Fed to achieve control over the US monetary supply inside the country. The Fed can take decisions depending on the economy state, to adopt an expansionary policy or a contractionary policy, whereby money supply is influenced via two methods.In periods of economic slowdown, it is the Fed frequent choice to consider adopting an expansionary policy. To begin with, the monetary base is expanded and interest rates are decreased. The essence of the expansionary policy is that money is more widely available to both banks and businesses, so that growth and development can be boosted. The results targeted are increase in the GDP and shrinking of the unemployment rate.Sometimes, following a period of rapid economic expansion the economy heats up. Before that happens or in the worst case scenario when this happens, the Fed proceeds to the adoption of a contractionary policy. In doing that, the central bank shrinks the monetary base and hikes the main interest rates. As a result, excess capital becomes scarcer, and a higher premium is imposed on lending. Owing to the smaller scale circulation of capital, the economy is bound to commence a slowdown. During the period of contraction the GDP is expected to decrease and the unemployment rate to rise.

With short-term interest rates effectively constrained at the zero lower bound, the FOMC shifted the focus of its monetary policy implementation directives to the SOMA portfolio. Changes in the size and composition of the portfolio allowed for further easing of monetary conditions.In 2014, the FOMC indicated that there would be two main components to monetary policy normalization: gradually raising the target range for the federal funds rate to more normal levels and gradually reducing the SOMA's securities holdings. The FOMC outlined its intended approach to these objectives in a statement of Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, initially published in September 2014 and periodically updated with additional details.In December 2015, the FOMC raised its target range for the federal funds rate for the first time since the financial crisis and indicated that adjustments to short-term interest rates once again would be the primary tool for adjusting the stance of monetary policy. Yet with an abundant supply of reserve balances, implementation of monetary policy required a new operational approach, because small variations in the supply of reserves would no longer cause meaningful changes in the federal funds rate.In September 2017, the FOMC announced its intention to begin normalizing the SOMA portfolio in October 2017, by gradually and predictably reducing its reinvestment of principal payments received from SOMA securities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

other,,"Meanwhile, there are two forms in securities transactions: outright transactions and RP (repurchase agreement) transactions. Outright transactions refer to operations where the central bank buys or sells eligible securities outright on the market. RP transactions are contracts under which the central bank sells (or buys) bonds with the condition that it will buy (or sell) them back after a specified period of time. Outright transactions are conducted only limitedly, since they are employed to provide or absorb liquidity permanently, and they therefore directly affect long-term market rates. For this reason, securities transactions focus mainly on RP transactions (mostly with 7-day maturities). Meanwhile, following the revision of the Bank of Korea Act in August 2011, the Bank can operate a securities lending and borrowing facility, which is enabling the Bank to not only enhance the efficiency of the liquidity management through flexible expansion of the volume of its RP sales, but also cope more effectively in the case of financial turmoil such as a credit crunch.Monetary Stabilization Bonds, issued by the Bank of Korea, have relatively long maturities. They are thus used as a structural adjustment tool whose policy effects are long lasting.Meanwhile, the Monetary Stabilization Account,utilized sinceOctober 2010, is a market-friendly term deposit facility. It is mainly used to fine-tune the reserve levels and to cope with unexpected changes in reserve supply and demand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The central bank's lending and deposit facilities are policy instruments through which it supplies loans to or receives deposits from individual financial institutions (under the Bank of Korea Act, financial institutions are limited to banking institutions). Traditionally, a central bank's monetary policy instruments refer to its lending facilities along with its open market operations and reserve requirement regime. As a number of central banks have introduced standing facilities allowing individual financial institutions to both take out temporary loans and make temporary deposits, their lending facilities have developed into lending and deposit facilities.The Bank of Korea also extended and reformed its existing lending facilities to turn them into lending and deposit facilities, by newly introducing Liquidity Adjustment Loans and Deposits, the standing facilities, in March 2008.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These loanscan beimplemented in the form of bill rediscounts or securities collateral loans, with the types of collateral including credit securities, government and public bonds and Monetary Stabilization Bonds.Additionally, in accordance with the Bank of Korea Act, the Bank can conduct credit operations with financial institutions at times when liquidity deteriorates due for example to imbalances between financing and use of funds, and also with for-profit enterprises when severe impediments to obtaining funds from financial institutions occur or when there is a strong likelihood of their occurrence.Meanwhile, the Bank of Korea also operates 'Liquidity Adjustment Deposit' facilities, which enable financial institutions to deposit their excess cash arising in the process of their supply of and demand for funds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The reserve requirement system is that whereby financial institutions are obliged to hold a certain ratio of their liabilities subject to reserve requirements (reserve requirement ratio) in their accounts with the central bank. The central bank can adjust liquidity in the markets and promote financial stability by changing financial institutions' funding situation through adjustment of the reserve requirement ratios. For example, since raising the reserve requirement ratios causes banks to deposit more money as their required reserves, their capacity to provide loans and purchase securities is reduced, thus leading to a decline in the volume of money in circulation. Consequently, liquidity is reduced and the possibility of financial unrest arising from an excessive increase in lending can be averted.Reserve requirements are still regarded as an important monetary policy tool in a number of major countries including Korea, although used less frequently than in the past as the monetary base-focused orientation of monetary policy has shifted to an interest rate-focused orientation around the world from the 1980s. This is ascribable to its great usefulness in that it not only ensures seamless payments and settlements among financial institutions across their checking accounts with the central bank by having them hold a certain proportion of their reserves in the accounts, but it also enhances the efficiency of interest rate policy by stabilizing short-term market ratesThe financial institutions subject to the current reserve requirement regime include commercial banks and specialized banks. These institutions are required to maintain reserves corresponding to their reserve requirement ratios differentiated within a range between 0~7% depending upon their deposit liability types**. Meanwhile, under the revised Bank of Korea Act, from December 17, 2011*** reserve requirements can be imposed on some types of bank debentures as well as the existing deposit liabilities. Financial institutions should maintain the required reserve in the Bank of Korea in the form of current deposits, but they may hold up to 35% of their reserves in the form of vault cash consisting of banknotes of the Bank of Korea.Reserve requirements may be imposed on the following Korean won denominated bank debentures whose maturity is less than 2 years: In periods of pronounced or likely monetary expansion, bank debentures issued by commercial banks during the periods deemed necessary to accumulate more reserves; or in periods of pronounced monetary expansion, bank debentures issued by specialized banks _ National Agricultural Cooperative Federation, National Federation of Fisheries Cooperatives, Industrial Bank of Korea, Korea Development Bank _ during periods determined by the Monetary Policy Board after consultation with the government regarding whether reserves should be accumulated and the periods of such accumulation.

other,,"An adjustment of the Base Rate affects interest rates in the financial markets as a whole, including short-term and long-term interest rates, and deposit and lending rates. For example, if the Bank of Korea raises its Base Rate, short-term interest rates such as overnight call rates rise immediately, deposit and lending rates show an underlying upward tendency, and long-term interest rates come under upward pressures. Such movements of various interest rates affect aggregate demand in the form of both consumption and investment. For instance, a hike in interest rates leads to a curb on borrowings, an increase in savings, rises in interest remuneration on deposits and on loans, and ultimately a decline in household consumption. This also applies to businesses. Ceteris paribus, an increase in interest rates raises financial expenses and accordingly reduces investment.A change in the Base Rate also influences prices of assets including stocks, bonds and real estate. For instance, if the Base Rate rises, the present value of future profits to be gained through assets such as stocks, bonds and real estate declines, and asset prices accordingly go down. This leads to a decrease in households' assets, or wealth, serving as a factor in bringing down household consumption.An adjustment of the Base Rate also influences banks' lending behavior. For example, if there is a Base Rate hike, banks may become even more prudent than before in lending, concerned about the redemption capacity of borrowers. This dampens both investment by businesses raising funds through bank loans and credit-based consumption by households.A change in the Base Rate affects the foreign exchange rate as well. For instance, if the Base Rate rises in Korea while rates in other countries remain unchanged, returns on Korean won-denominated assets will increase relatively, which will attract foreign capital. As the number of persons hoping to purchase Korean won-denominated assets grows, the won will appreciate. Its appreciation will bring down prices of imported goods and services and demand for them will accordingly grow. This will in turn push up prices of export goods denominated in foreign currency, which will lead to a decline in overseas demand for Korean goods and services.These changes in aggregate demand, in the form of consumption, investment and exports (overseas demand), through various channels again affect prices. For instance, a fall in aggregate demand, in terms such as consumption, investment and exports, following a hike in the Base Rate, serves to put downward pressure on prices. In the exchange rate channel, in particular, a fall in Korean won-denominated import prices resulting from the won's appreciation serves as a direct factor in bringing down domestic consumer prices.An adjustment of the Base Rate leads to a change in inflation expectations, consequently affecting prices. For example, an increase in the Base Rate is interpreted as showing the Bank of Korea's resolve to reduce price inflation, which brings inflation expectations down. This consequently influences firms' setting of their product prices and wages, as a result pulling real price inflation down.

other,,"The rule of thumb for monetary policymakers has long been that if inflation is below official target ranges, short-term interest rates should be set at a level that spurs spending and investment. This approach has meant that once interest rates reach or approach zero, central banks have little choice but to activate large asset-purchase programs that are supposed to stimulate demand. When circumstances call for it, policymakers default to the predetermined scripts of neo-Keynesian economic models.But in too many cases, those scripts have led us astray, because they assume that monetary policy has a measurable and foreseeable impact on demand and inflation. There is plenty of reason to question this assumption.For starters, households have not responded to ultra-low interest rates by saving less and spending more. If savings no longer yield a return, people can¡¯t afford big-ticket items or pay for retirement down the road. Likewise, companies today are faced with so much uncertainty and so many risks that ever-lower costs of capital have not enticed them to invest more.It¡¯s easy to see why, despite the data, predetermined formulas are attractive to monetary policymakers. The prevailing wisdom holds that in order to return the inflation rate to a preferred level, any slack in the economy must be eliminated. This requires pushing interest rates as low as possible, and when these policies have run their course (such as when rates dip toward the negative), unconventional instruments like ¡°quantitative easing¡± must be deployed to revive growth and inflation. The paradigm has become so universally accepted _ and the model simulations underpinning central banks¡¯ decisions have become so complex _ that few are willing to question it. For individual central banks or economists, to do so would be sacrilege.Central banks do not completely deny the economic costs that these policies imply: exuberance in financial markets, financing gaps in funded pension systems, and deeper wealth inequality, to name just a few. But these costs are deemed an acceptable price to pay to reach the clearly defined inflation level.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the Central Bank uses monetary policy to control inflation and keep it within a desired path.Economic and price stability is a situation where there are no wide fluctuations in the general price level in the economy, which helps to achieve sustainable economic growth. When the prices fluctuate at a low rate, they would not have any significant influence on economic decisions of agents of the economy, viz. households and firms. Moreover, price stability helps better anchor inflation expectations among public, which in turn makes it easier to keep actual inflation at low and stable levels. Therefore, stable prices would not distort the economic decisions regarding what to produce and how to produce, thus enabling efficient allocation of resources in the economy leading to economic stability and sustainable growth in the economy over the longer term.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"At present, the Central Bank conducts monetary policy in line with a flexible inflation targeting (FIT) framework, aimed at stabilising inflation at mid single digit levels over the medium term while supporting economic growth to reach its potential. In terms of operational aspects of this framework, the Central Bank uses its policy instruments to guide short term interest rates, particularly the average weighted call money rate (AWCMR) as the operating target.Prior to this transition, the Central Bank conducted monetary policy within an enhanced monetary policy framework with features of both monetary targeting and flexible inflation targeting (FIT). Under this enhanced monetary policy framework, the Central Bank attempted to stabilise inflation in mid-single digits over the medium term, while supporting the growth momentum of the economy and flexibility in exchange rate management. Similar to the current practice, the AWCMR was used as the operating target.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"During the early 1980's, the Central Bank adopted monetary targeting as its monetary policy framework, and monetary aggregates became the key nominal anchor in the conduct of monetary policy. Under a monetary targeting framework, the changes in money supply are considered as primary causal factors affecting price stability. In general, two major definitions of monetary aggregates are considered in analysing monetary developments in Sri Lanka. The first is 'reserve money' consisting of currency issued by the Central Bank and commercial banks' deposits with the Central Bank. This is also called base money or high-powered money, as commercial banks can create deposits based on reserve money which are components of a broader definition of money supply, through their process of creating credit and deposits. The second is broad money defined as the sum of currency held by the public and all deposits held by the public with commercial banks. Studies have shown that the most appropriate monetary variable to analyse the relationship between the money supply and the general price level is the broad money supply.Given the rising volatility in money multiplier and velocity amid a weakening relationship between money supply and inflation, the role of monetary targets as a nominal anchor has become uncertain and also complicated the Central Bank¡¯s communication strategy. Accordingly, instead of reserve money, Central Bank currently uses average weighted call money rate (AWCMR) as its operating target under its enhanced monetary policy framework. However, although the Central Bank does not announce any monetary targets explicitly, broad money supply (M2b) remains the key indicative intermediate variable to guide monetary policy.The Central Bank conducts its Open Market Operations (OMO) within the corridor of interest rates formed by its policy rates i.e. the standing deposit facility rate (formerly the repurchase rate) and the standing lending facility rate (formerly the reverse repurchase rate), to achieve the intended inflation path. Policy rates are periodically reviewed and adjusted appropriately, if necessary, to guide the interest rate structure of the economy with a view to achieve the desired path of inflation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The Central Bank¡¯s monetary policy decisions are made to maintain a low and stable inflation rate over time, which is an indication of price stability.Inflation is a general increase in price levels over time. It is based on the prices of various consumer goods and services, which are evaluated and statistically represented in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The month-on-month (or year-on-year) inflation rate is determined by comparing the CPI for a particular month to the CPI of that same month in the previous year.Inflation is caused by numerous factors, both locally and internationally. For example, during periods of drought or excessive rain, the prices of food could increase, leading to an increase in the inflation rate. International factors like increases or decreases in oil prices can also lead to changes in inflation reflecting movements in energy and transport costs. Depreciation in the exchange rate against the major currencies can also cause inflation since Kenya is a net importer of goods. Inflation can also be caused by factors that influence the demand for goods and services, like the amount of money ordinary people have available to spend.High levels of inflation inhibit economic growth and cause the Kenya Shilling to lose value compared to international currencies,  thereby discouraging the purchase of Kenyan goods and services. It also makes it difficult for people to make long-term financial decisions, as they cannot be sure about the future value of their investments and savings. If there is a general decrease of prices over time due to a collapse in demand or increased supply of goods and services, then there is deflation. Deflation inhibits economic growth by reducing profit and lowering investor incentives.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Monetary policy is guided by a monetary programme, which is premised on the economic growth and inflation targets provided by the National Treasury. Monetary policy decisions are made by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). The MPC meets at least once every two months and reviews data and analysis from various sources including the Central Bank Departments enabling it to decide on any action to maintain or vary its stance.The daily monetary policy activities are undertaken by the Monetary Policy Management Committee, which meets at least three times a week.The Central Bank has several tools that it can use to counter changes in the market and influence price stability:Commercial banks in Kenya are required by law to keep a specified proportion of their total deposits at the Central Bank. This proportion of deposits is called the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR), and when the Central Bank needs to significantly adjust the amount of money in the market, it can increase or decrease the ratio.The CRR deposits are held in the CBK at no interest. The CRR is currently set at 5.25 percent of the total of a bank¡¯s domestic and foreign currency deposit liabilities. To facilitate commercial banks¡¯ liquidity management, commercial banks are currently required to maintain their CRR based on a daily average level from the 15th of the previous month to the 14th of the current month and not to fall below a CRR of 3 percent on any day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That mandate is explicitly stipulated in Act No. 23 of 1999 concerning Bank Indonesia, as amended by Act No. 3 of 2004 and Act No. 6 of 2009 in Article 7. Rupiah stability encompasses two dimensions. First, rupiah stability is the price stability of goods and services, as reflected by inflation. The second dimension relates to rupiah exchange rate stability against other currencies. Indonesia implements a free-floating exchange rate regime and exchange rate stability is necessary to achieve and maintain price and financial system stabilityIn pursuit of its mandate, Bank Indonesia adopted the Inflation Targeting Framework (ITF) as its monetary policy framework on 1st July 2005.

Nonetheless, Bank Indonesia continues to refine its monetary policy framework based on the changing dynamics and economic challenges faced in order to increase effectiveness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"In the implementation of monetary policy, Bank Indonesia applies an Inflation Targeting Framework (ITF). ITF is a framework of publicly announcing an inflation target corridor and adjusting monetary policy to achieve that target as part of the commitment and accountability of the central bank. In practice, ITF is implemented using a policy rate as a signal of monetary policy and the interbank rate as the operational target. The Inflation Targeting Framework was formally adopted by Bank Indonesia on 1st July 2005, replacing base money as the target of monetary policy.Based on experience from the Global Financial Crisis in 2008/2009, an important lesson that emerged was the need for adequate central bank flexibility in response to more complex economic developments and a stronger financial sector influence on macroeconomic stability. Consequently, Bank Indonesia strengthened the ITF framework through its evolution into Flexible ITF.__",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The overriding objective of monetary policy is to create and maintain rupiah stability, as reflected by low and stable inflation.  To that end, Bank Indonesia sets the BI 7-Day (Reverse) Repo Rate as the main policy instrument that influences economic activity, with inflation as the ultimate goal.  The process of setting the BI7DRR to achieving the inflation target is transmitted through various channels with a time lag. Adjusting the BI7DRR to influence inflation is known as the monetary policy transmission mechanism.  This mechanism shows how Bank Indonesia policy, through adjustments to monetary instruments and the operational target, influences various economic and financial variables before ultimately affecting inflation.  The mechanism works through interactions between the central bank, banking industry and financial sector, as well as the real sector.  Adjustments to the BI7DRR influence inflation through various channels, including the interest rate channel, credit channel, exchange rate channel, asset price channel and expectations channel.. In terms of the interest rate channel, adjustments to the BI7DRR influence deposit rates and lending rates in the banking industry.  Bank Indonesia can utilise tight-bias monetary policy by raising interest rates, which impacts aggregate demand and alleviates inflationary pressures.  In contrast, reducing the BI7DRR will lower lending rates thus increasing corporate and household demand for loans.  In addition, lower lending rates also reduce the cost of capital for investment in the corporate sector, thus stoking consumption and investment activity and stimulating the economy..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Adjustments to the BI7DRR can also influence the exchange rate through the exchange rate channel.  A hike in the BI7DRR, for example, would increase the differential between interest rates in Indonesia and other countries.  A wider interest rate differential would attract non-resident investors to place capital in financial instruments in Indonesia seeking a higher rate of return. In turn, the foreign capital inflow would trigger rupiah appreciation, leading to cheaper imports and more expensive, or less competitive, exports from Indonesia, thus stimulating higher imports while simultaneously reducing exports.  Consequently, rupiah appreciation would ease inflationary pressures.   The impact of changes in interest rates on economic activity also influences public inflation expectations through the expectations channel.  Lower interest rates stimulate economic activity an increase inflation, with workers thus anticipating higher inflation and, hence, demanding higher wages.  Producers subsequently pass on the cost of higher wages to consumers by raising prices. The monetary policy transmission mechanism is characterised by a variable time lag.  The time lag associated with each transmission channel is different.  Under normal conditions, the banking industry will respond to increases/decreases in the BI7DRR by raising/lowering interest rates.  Notwithstanding, if the banking industry detects higher risk in the economy, the response to a downward BI7DRR movement is slower.  In addition, in the case of banking industry consolidation to increase capital, lower lending rates and increasing demand for loans do not necessarily increase bank lending in response.  On the demand side, consumers may not necessarily respond to lower lending rates in the banking industry through higher demand for loans if the economic outlook is weak.  Therefore, the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission is affected by external conditions, the financial sector and banking industry, as well as the real sector. __",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

other,,"The economic decisions of households can have a significant impact on an economy. For example, a decision on the part of households to consume more and to save less can lead to an increase in employment, investment, and ultimately profits. Equally, the investment decisions made by corporations can have an important impact on the real economy and on corporate profits. But individual corporations can rarely affect large economies on their own; the decisions of a single household concerning consumption will have a negligible impact on the wider economy.By contrast, the decisions made by governments can have an enormous impact on even the largest and most developed of economies for two main reasons. First, the public sectors of most developed economies normally employ a significant proportion of the population, and they are usually responsible for a significant proportion of spending in an economy. Second, governments are also the largest borrowers in world debt markets.Government policy is ultimately expressed through its borrowing and spending activities. In this reading, we identify and discuss two types of government policy that can affect the macroeconomy and financial markets: monetary policy and fiscal policy. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Monetary policy refers to central bank activities that are directed toward influencing the quantity of money and credit in an economy. By contrast, fiscal policy refers to the government¡¯s decisions about taxation and spending. Both monetary and fiscal policies are used to regulate economic activity over time. They can be used to accelerate growth when an economy starts to slow or to moderate growth and activity when an economy starts to overheat. In addition, fiscal policy can be used to redistribute income and wealth.The overarching goal of both monetary and fiscal policy is normally the creation of an economic environment where growth is stable and positive and inflation is stable and low. Crucially, the aim is therefore to steer the underlying economy so that it does not experience economic booms that may be followed by extended periods of low or negative growth and high levels of unemployment. In such a stable economic environment, householders can feel secure in their consumption and saving decisions, while corporations can concentrate on their investment decisions, on making their regular coupon payments to their bond holders and on making profits for their shareholders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The challenges to achieving this overarching goal are many. Not only are economies frequently buffeted by shocks (such as oil price jumps), but some economists believe that natural cycles in the economy also exist. Moreover, there are plenty of examples from history where government policies¡ªeither monetary, fiscal, or both¡ªhave exacerbated an economic expansion that eventually led to damaging consequences for the real economy, for financial markets, and for investors.The balance of the reading is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an introduction to monetary policy and related topics. Section 3 presents fiscal policy. The interactions between monetary policy and fiscal policy are the subject of Section 4. A summary and practice problems conclude the reading.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"In this reading, we have sought to explain the practices of both monetary and fiscal policy. Both can have a significant impact on economic activity, and it is for this reason that financial analysts need to be aware of the tools of both monetary and fiscal policy, the goals of the monetary and fiscal authorities, and most important the monetary and fiscal policy transmission mechanisms.Governments can influence the performance of their economies by using combinations of monetary and fiscal policy. Monetary policy refers to central bank activities that are directed toward influencing the quantity of money and credit in an economy. By contrast, fiscal policy refers to the government¡¯s decisions about taxation and spending. The two sets of policies affect the economy via different mechanisms.Money fulfills three important functions: It acts as a medium of exchange, provides individuals with a way of storing wealth, and provides society with a convenient unit of account. Via the process of fractional reserve banking, the banking system can create money.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The amount of wealth that the citizens of an economy choose to hold in the form of money¡ªas opposed to, for example, bonds or equities¡ªis known as the demand for money. There are three basic motives for holding money: transactions-related, precautionary, and speculative.The addition of 1 unit of additional reserves to a fractional reserve banking system can support an expansion of the money supply by an amount equal to the money multiplier, defined as 1/reserve requirement (stated as a decimal).The nominal rate of interest is comprised of three components: a real required rate of return, a component to compensate lenders for future inflation, and a risk premium to compensate lenders for uncertainty (e.g., about the future rate of inflation).Central banks take on multiple roles in modern economies. They are usually the monopoly supplier of their currency, the lender of last resort to the banking sector, the government¡¯s bank and bank of the banks, and they often supervise banks. Although they may express their objectives in different ways, the overarching objective of most central banks is price stability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"For a central bank to be able to implement monetary policy objectively, it should have a degree of independence from government, be credible, and be transparent in its goals and objectives.The ultimate challenge for central banks as they try to manipulate the supply of money to influence the economy is that they cannot control the amount of money that households and corporations put in banks on deposit, nor can they easily control the willingness of banks to create money by expanding credit. Taken together, this also means that they cannot always control the money supply. Therefore, there are definite limits to the power of monetary policy.The concept of money neutrality is usually interpreted as meaning that money cannot influence the real economy in the long run. However, by the setting of its policy rate, a central bank hopes to influence the real economy via the policy rate¡¯s impact on other market interest rates, asset prices, the exchange rate, and the expectations of economic agents. Inflation targeting is the most common monetary policy¡ªalthough exchange rate targeting is also used, particularly in developing economies. Quantitative easing attempts to spur aggregate demand by drastically increasing the money supply.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Fiscal policy involves the use of government spending and revenue raising (taxation) to impact a number of aspects of the economy: the overall level of aggregate demand in an economy and hence the level of economic activity; the distribution of income and wealth among different segments of the population; and hence ultimately the allocation of resources between different sectors and economic agents.The tools that governments use in implementing fiscal policy are related to the way in which they raise revenue and the different forms of expenditure. Governments usually raise money via a combination of direct and indirect taxes. Government expenditure can be current on goods and services or can take the form of capital expenditure, for example, on infrastructure projects.As economic growth weakens, or when it is in recession, a government can enact an expansionary fiscal policy¡ªfor example, by raising expenditure without an offsetting increase in taxation. Conversely, by reducing expenditure and maintaining tax revenues, a contractionary policy might reduce economic activity. Fiscal policy can therefore play an important role in stabilizing an economy.Although both fiscal and monetary policy can alter aggregate demand, they work through different channels, the policies are therefore not interchangeable, and they conceivably can work against one another unless the government and central bank coordinate their objectives. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"We review a growing literature that incorporates endogenous risk premiums and risk-taking in the conduct of monetary policy. Accommodative policy can create an intertemporal tradeoff between improving current financial conditions at a cost of increasing future financial vulnerabilities. In the United States, structural and cyclical macroprudential tools to reduce vulnerabilities at banks are being implemented, but may not be sufficient because activities can migrate and there are limited tools for non-bank intermediaries or for borrowers. While monetary policy itself can influence vulnerabilities, its efficacy as a tool will depend on the costs of tighter policy on activity and inflation. We highlight how adding a risk-taking channel to traditional transmission channels could significantly alter a cost-benefit calculation for using monetary policy, and that considering risks to financial stability-as downside risks to employment-is consistent with the dual mandate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The recipe worked brilliantly. Sustained price stability and steady economic growth were the order of the day. The result was the Great Moderation. Indeed, monetary policy was getting boring. During this period, monetary policy was unencumbered by financial stability considerations. To be fair, central bankers were not unconcerned about financial stability. But it was seen as the preserve of prudential regulation and supervision. Academic thinking reinforced policy practice: the macroeconomic models central banks relied on did not map clear linkages between financial and real variables.Another constraint may have been the perceived difficulty in identifying a financial bubble ex ante. How does one tell if the value of an asset reflected economic fundamentals or speculative fever? So when faced with potential financial vulnerabilities, it was deemed better to clean up after a bubble had actually burst than to try to lean against suspected bubbles.But beneath the still waters of macroeconomic stability, deadly financial whirlpools were forming. Financial imbalances built up steadily in the advanced economies from the mid-1990s to the mid-¡¯00s and culminated in the global financial crisis. The crisis sent financial systems spinning and plunged economies into recession. The cost of cleaning up proved extremely high. All this reignited debate about how to proceed, and monetary policy became interesting again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The intellectual underpinning for the second approach is based on the insight that monetary policy has the potential to affect financial stability through several channels, one of the most important of which is the risk-taking channel. US Federal Reserve governor Jeremy C. Stein puts it succinctly: ¡°Monetary policy is fundamentally in the business of altering risk premiums.¡± Loose monetary policy can heighten vulnerabilities in the financial system by altering both the perception of risk and the tolerance for risk. In conventional monetary policy, lower policy rates boost incomes and profits and enhance asset and collateral values. This reduces the incidence of default in banks¡¯ asset portfolios, leading to greater leveraging and risk-taking. In unconventional monetary policy, large-scale asset purchases by central banks depress returns along the entire yield curve. This provides asset managers the incentive to take on more risk, often in a herdlike fashion.When interest rates are below the natural rate at which desired investment and savings reach equilibrium, banks will continue to expand credit. When economic agents are determined to take risks, they will find ways to circumvent measures that central banks and regulators have put in place. Nonmonetary tools such as macroprudential policy will therefore not adequately address the root problem caused by interest rates that are too low.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Under these circumstances, arguably only monetary policy can ¡°get in all of the cracks¡± to plug the vulnerabilities. An increase in short-term interest rates will trigger a more realistic evaluation of asset and collateral values, income flows, and, thus, risks. This will curtail the extent of leverage created by banks and capital markets and keep asset managers from crowding into risky assets. The effects of monetary policy are all-pervasive and cannot be easily circumvented.This approach, if formalized, amounts to augmenting the Taylor rule with an additional term to capture deviations in financial variables from their equilibrium levels. If financial-market imbalances are growing, ceteris paribus, monetary policy should be tightened, even if it causes further deviations in actual output from potential output in the short run. This approach does not preclude the need for robust financial regulation and supervision. But the key is to get the price of money right, and to encourage a more realistic perception and tolerance of risks.While no central bank currently implements monetary policy in this way, the concept behind the approach may not be as abstract as it seems. In practice, central bankers do not ignore financial-stability considerations when setting monetary policy.

other,,"The rule of thumb for monetary policymakers has long been that if inflation is below official target ranges, short-term interest rates should be set at a level that spurs spending and investment. This approach has meant that once interest rates reach or approach zero, central banks have little choice but to activate large asset-purchase programs that are supposed to stimulate demand. When circumstances call for it, policymakers default to the predetermined scripts of neo-Keynesian economic models.But in too many cases, those scripts have led us astray, because they assume that monetary policy has a measurable and foreseeable impact on demand and inflation. There is plenty of reason to question this assumption.For starters, households have not responded to ultra-low interest rates by saving less and spending more. If savings no longer yield a return, people can¡¯t afford big-ticket items or pay for retirement down the road. Likewise, companies today are faced with so much uncertainty and so many risks that ever-lower costs of capital have not enticed them to invest more.It¡¯s easy to see why, despite the data, predetermined formulas are attractive to monetary policymakers.

For individual central banks or economists, to do so would be sacrilege.Central banks do not completely deny the economic costs that these policies imply: exuberance in financial markets, financing gaps in funded pension systems, and deeper wealth inequality, to name just a few. But these costs are deemed an acceptable price to pay to reach the clearly defined inflation level.Yet the policies pursued in recent years have given no room for the intangibles _ unstable political environments, geopolitical tremors, or rising risks on financial markets _ that can send models off course. As the 2008 financial crisis illustrated, the normal distribution of risk was useless for predictions.Keynes never tired of arguing that monetary policy becomes ineffective if uncertainty is sufficient to destabilize the expectations of consumers and investors. Unfortunately, many central banks have forgotten this. The Bank of Japan, the Bank of England, and the European Central Bank all hone to rather rigid policy rules. If expansionary policies fail to have the desired effect of lifting inflation to the predefined level of around 2%, they do not question their models; they simply increase the policy dosage _ which is just what markets expect.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"For now, the US Federal Reserve has the most flexible toolkit among the major central banks. In addition to inflationary pressure, the Fed¡¯s monetary policy must also take into account employment statistics, growth data, and the stability of financial markets. But even the Fed¡¯s flexibility is under siege. Republican lawmakers are discussing how to bind the Fed to more scripted policy rules to manage inflation (using a formula known as the Taylor rule, which predetermines changes in the federal funds rate in relation to inflation and an output gap). Needless to say, such a move would be a mistake.Central banks (not to mention lawmakers), with their strong attachment to neo-Keynesian theory, are ignoring a major lesson from decades of monetary-policy experimentation: the impact of monetary policy cannot be predicted with a high degree of certainty or accuracy. But the belief that it can is essential to the credibility of the now-standard inflation targets. If central banks keep missing these rather narrow marks (¡°below, but close to 2%¡±), they end up in an expectations trap, whereby markets expect them to dispense ever higher doses of monetary medicine in a frantic attempt to reach their target.Clearly, such monetary policies create soaring costs and risks for the economy. And central banks themselves are coming dangerously close to looking like fiscal agents, which could undermine their legitimacy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"A new and more realistic monetary paradigm would discard overly rigid rules that embody the fallacy that monetary policy is always effective. It would give central banks more room to incorporate the risks and costs of monetary policies.

They would define their inflation targets more flexibly, to avoid being forced into action whenever ¡°uncertainties¡± such as declining oil prices or required wage adjustments cause inflation to move above or below 2%.Perhaps most important, a new paradigm would acknowledge the limits of central banks¡¯ power and foresight.

other,,"Monetary policy is essentially the way in which the Federal Reserve controls the quantity of money in the economy and the avenues in which new money is injected into it. The Fed¡¯s motivation in conducting monetary policy is in following the mandate by Congress to fulfill three goals: maximize employment, stabilize prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. This directive is satisfied when citizens who are looking for work are ¡°gainfully employed¡± and when the prices for goods/services are comparatively stable. The Federal Reserve has three tools at its disposal to conduct monetary policy: open market operations, the discount rate, and reserve requirements. These three tools are actually controlled by two different entities. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve system is responsible for setting the discount rate and the reserve requirements. The Federal Open Market Committee is responsible for open market operations. In order to better understand the tools that the Federal Reserve uses, we¡¯ll define them here so that you can develop a deeper understanding as we go along: ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Open market operations refer to the process by which the Federal Reserve buys or sells government securities. This process is considered ¡°open¡± because the Fed cannot pick and choose what securities dealers it wants to work with; instead, the securities dealers compete against each other on the price of the government securities market. The Federal Reserve discount rate is the interest rate charged to commercial banks and depository institutions on loans that are received from their regional Federal Reserve Bank¡¯s lending facility. The Fed is able to offer three different types of credit to depository institutions: primary, secondary, and seasonal credit. All three of these credits have different associated interest rates and are all fully secured. These rates are uniform across all of the Federal Reserve¡¯s banks and are determined by the Reserve Bank¡¯s Board of Directors. The reserve requirement is the amount of cash that the Federal Reserve requires banks must have on hand, in their vaults, or in the Federal Reserve Bank that is nearest the bank. Effective monetary policy is based strictly on the situation presented. One such example would be a situation in which a country is facing high unemployment and a recession at the same time. It¡¯s the job of the Federal Reserve to set the correct monetary policies in order to jumpstart the economy and lower the unemployment rate. In this case, the best solution would be to start an expansionary monetary policy. This policy would allow the Fed to lower interest rates, leading to an increased supply of cash, higher spending rates, and increased employment rates as businesses choose to grow instead of contract their labor force.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With growth picking up and unemployment low, policymakers expect core inflation ¡ª which excludes the food and energy categories ¡ª to rise 2.1 percent in 2019 and 2020. That¡¯s slightly above their 2 percent target.The Fed has lifted its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point to a range of 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent. It is the sixth increase since December 2015, when it began raising rates from rock-bottom levels. The rate hike is the first under new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who replaced Janet Yellen last month.The economy is growing moderately and ¡°job gains have been strong in recent months,¡± Fed policymakers say in a statement following the conclusion of its two-day meeting.Fed policymakers expect to hike just three times this year, consistent with its last forecast in December.

other,,"Fifty years ago next month, with inflation rising and growing trade deficits, President Richard Nixon suspended the conversion of the U.S. dollar into gold. This decision effectively ended the Bretton Woods system ¡ª the final attempt at an international gold standard ¡ª and ushered in a new era of floating exchange rates between major currencies, rather than rates fixed by policymakers.The end of gold-backed money and fixed exchange rates has been controversial, but it remains the right decision.Former congressman and presidential candidate Ron Paul decided to first enter politics because of his disappointment with Nixon¡¯s decision. Some commentators have argued floating exchange rates are a major source of instability and seek a return to some sort of Bretton Woods-style arrangement. Many argue that as a rules-based monetary policy, a new gold standard would constrain central banks (including the Federal Reserve) from creating inflation, and fiscal policymakers (including Congress) from running unhealthy budget deficits.While central banks should pursue a more accountable, rules-based approach to monetary policy, a new gold standard would do much more harm than good.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"In 1944, representatives from the Allied powers developed Bretton Woods for the postwar era. Their goal was to create a regime that produced exchange rate stability in a tumultuous world, while also giving each nation¡¯s central bank latitude to pursue its own policies.The dollar was set at $35 per ounce of gold. Other currencies, such as the British pound and German mark, were pegged to the dollar, but these pegs could be adjusted. It took nearly 15 years to get the system running, and even then, it suffered from major flaws that gave it a short lifespan. For example, in 1967, the United Kingdom had difficulty maintaining its peg, so it devalued the pound. This boosted exports but also raised inflation.Challenges in the United States ultimately led to Bretton Woods¡¯ demise. Large trade deficits with West Germany and Japan and large budget deficits under the Johnson and Nixon administrations led to more U.S. dollars held abroad. Eventually, there was not enough U.S. gold to redeem those dollars. Recognizing this, speculators sold their dollars, causing ¡°runs¡± on the currency and making it even more difficult for the United States to maintain its exchange rates with other countries. Nixon suspended the dollar¡¯s conversion into gold, and although he announced that the suspension would be temporary, the system was never salvaged.While one can argue that Bretton Woods used a poorly designed gold standard ¡ª giving too much room to governments to pursue monetary and fiscal policies and creating tension within the system ¡ª this does not mean we should return to another gold standard, even one like the relatively well-functioning pre-World War I classical gold standard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The classical gold standard period was an era where central banks either did not exist or had much less discretion, where prices were more flexible, and where the public did not expect governments to provide modern social services. These conditions simply do not exist today.In at least some respects, central banks are already taking steps toward a more rules-based monetary system. Beginning in the 1990s, many began targeting 2 percent inflation, and inflation since then has generally been low across the developed world (the recent uptick notwithstanding). Last year, the Fed modified this goal by targeting 2 percent inflation on average over time, which means making up for past misses of the target.An even better goal would be to target total dollar spending in the economy, or nominal gross domestic product. Among the differences in this approach is that it allows inflation to rise temporarily in response to recessions. This reduces the severity of debt burdens and stimulates the economy¡¯s recovery. It also allows inflation to fall during economic booms, helping consumers. Moreover, nominal gross domestic product targeting can be rules-based, making policy more predictable and constrained.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"After several months of steady economic recovery and market ascent, we suddenly find ourselves in yet another alarming moment of economic uncertainty and potential peril. Thanks to a historic rise in inflation, the Federal Reserve just moved up its timeline for rate hikes. Stock prices quickly took a downward turn, signaling the possibility of a new era of market volatility. At the same time, some in Washington seek to reimpose on the United States the industrialized world¡¯s highest corporate taxes and even begin taxing all financial transactions. Amid all of this, the ability to anticipate market developments and pivot quickly becomes even more important, particularly for institutional investors like pensions which require reliable returns for their members.Unfortunately, too many activists and political leaders, fueled by the GameStop and other so-called meme stock volatility episodes, remain stubbornly obsessed with demonizing and restricting one of the most important tools for navigating a volatile market: short sales. A corrective to the anti-short sales campaign is therefore needed. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"¡°Short sales¡± simply refer to financial transactions executed when traders consider certain stocks overvalued. In such cases, traders borrow the stocks in question at current market value and then sell them to willing purchasers at that same price. The short sellers then wait for the stocks¡¯ value to decline, at which point they buy the same stock at a lower price than the price at which they borrowed and sold the stock. Finally, they return that stock to the original lender from whom they initially borrowed, thus profiting on the difference.  To illustrate, imagine an investor who believes that hypothetical Stock A¡¯s current market price is overvalued at $100 per share. Accordingly, that investor borrows Stock A at $100 per share and sells it to another buyer at that same price. Later, imagine Stock A falls to $50 per share, at which point the investor snatches up shares to return to the original lender. Since the stock that is being returned to the original lender was bought for $50, the investor pockets a $50 per share profit, which was the difference between the $100 per share sale of the borrowed stock and the $50 purchase of the replacement shares.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"It¡¯s important to remember, however, that there¡¯s no guarantee that the short seller¡¯s expectation of a stock¡¯s market price decline will actually occur. If Stock A¡¯s market price instead increases to $150 per share when the borrowed shares must be returned, then that investor loses $50 per share from having to purchase shares at a higher price to return to the original share lender, thus paying the price for an incorrect expectation of share decline. That¡¯s how markets work and should work.  Accordingly, short sales are perfectly logical and legitimate transactions for traders who believe that a company¡¯s stock is overvalued. Indeed, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) determined short sales account for fully 49 percent of all listed equity share volume, and The Wall Street Journal¡¯s ¡°Business World¡± guru Holman Jenkins highlights how there¡¯s nothing salacious or even extraordinary about them.  Moreover, short sales serve a critical signaling role in markets and our economy, which is why efforts to restrict or even prohibit them are so dangerous. Contrarian short-sellers challenge conventional market wisdom, and thereby help identify potential bubbles, overpriced stocks, and wise investment opportunities. The stocks in question might be overpriced due to underlying improper internal business practices, as was the case with Enron, Tyco, and Worldcom. In other instances, the subject stocks might be overpriced due to looming technological innovations or market changes, and short selling signals approaching downturns like the 2008 housing market collapse to the rest of the world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That¡¯s not going to happen right away, or next year, or any specific time in the foreseeable future, but it¡¯s here to stay. You might compare it to the advent of coins made of precious metals as the way to buy and sell products a few thousand years ago rather than simply trade one product for another. Or perhaps to understand its enormity, consider the rise of paper currency in place of coins or perhaps the advent of accounts to and from which money flows by paper checks.At last, the Treasury Department has taken the initiative by decreeing that the Internal Revenue Service has to know about any movement of cryptocurrency above $10,000. The whole point is to make it more difficult to avoid taxes by investing in cryptocurrency, but enforcement will be difficult considering that so many transactions are outside the U.S. Who¡¯s to know what¡¯s going on?Now, with the rise of the internet, cryptocurrency is so easily used as a medium of payment, of buying and selling, even of saving money, that it¡¯s tempting to ask why all of us are not getting into it.

Cryptocurrencies typically do not.¡±Considering the terrific risks, controversy over regulating cryptocurrency is inevitable. Just about every U.S. agency with anything to do with money is involved in cryptocurrency, creating an atmosphere of tremendous confusion. A great question is whether much more centralized supervision is needed to regulate this new way of doing business or whether less regulation would enable the cryptocurrency revolution to grow and spread for the benefit of billions.Right now it¡¯s much too early to be sure how to harness the use of cryptocurrency so that fair play, free of scamming, is possible, but Hester Peirce, at the Securities and Exchange Commission, told MarketWatch she believes the U.S. ¡°is certainly falling behind the curve¡± in legislating what to do. ¡°We¡¯ve seen other countries take a more productive approach to regulating cryptocurrency,¡± she said. ¡°Our approach has been to say no and tell people waitwe need to build a framework that is appropriate for this industry.¡±",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed, decentralization of the system of cryptocurrency makes it more viable as a means to do business. The question is how to make sure this strange new form of finance actually works for everyone.Cryptocurrencies by now are flooding the world with numerous entities getting into the act. ¡°It¡¯s gotten so big, it now is worth more than all of the U.S. dollars in circulation globally,¡± Eric Lipton, investigating for The New York Times, told CBS. ¡°It¡¯s no longer even conceivable for U.S. regulators to say, we¡¯re going to ban cryptocurrency in the United States.¡±But the risks are huge.

Along with this type of activity are ransomware attacks in which operatives demand millions for restoring huge accounts, corporate secrets, and message traffic torn away from major companies.In the U.S., an attack on the Colonial Pipeline, responsible for shipping nearly half the fuel for the eastern United States, had to shut down for several days before reportedly paying $5 million in ransom to a criminal gang in Eastern Europe called Dark Side.

It was ¡°shocking,¡± he says.It was also unprecedented. Prices rose at an alarming double-digit rate but the economy stopped growing. That¡¯s something economists previously said couldn¡¯t happen simultaneously. It led to a new term: stagflation.Most analysts agree politics, not the rising price of oil, caused stagflation. In 1970 Nixon, looking to the 1972 elections as was most of Congress, sought policies that would reverse the recession of the late 1960s just as governments today use spending and the Fed to restart the economy.Nixon ended the Bretton Woods agreement. That broke the last dollar link to gold. Gutting Bretton Woods cheapened the dollar. Foreigners holding dollars were short-changed.It also meant that ¡°the check on the government¡¯s ability to increase the quantity of money¡ªthe gold standard_is gone,¡± wrote Bruce Bartlett in the book ¡°Reaganomics.¡± Government, he added, now had a ¡°powerful interest in maintaining a steady rate of inflation.¡± Once stagflation began, it was difficult to stop, historians note.Three presidents, Nixon, Ford, and Carter, struggled with solving stagflation. ¡°Nothing seemed to work,¡± wrote economist Robert Sobel in ¡°The Worldly Economists.¡±",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

other,,"Since the MPC¡¯s meeting during June 2-4, 2021 the pace of global recovery appears to be moderating with the resurgence of infections in several parts of the world, especially from the delta variant of the virus. In June and July, global purchasing managers¡¯ indices (PMIs) slipped from the highs scaled in May. The growing consensus is that the recovery is occurring on a diverging two-track mode. Countries that are ahead in vaccination and have been able to provide or maintain policy stimulus are rebounding strongly. Growth in other economies remains subdued and vulnerable to new waves of infections. There has been a slowing of momentum in global trade volumes in Q2:2021, with elevated shipping charges and logistics costs posing headwinds.There has been a considerable hardening of commodity prices, particularly of crude oil. The latest agreement within the Organisation of Petroleum Countries (OPEC) plus to raise oil production for a likely restoration of output to the pre-pandemic levels by September 2022 imparted transient softening to spot and future crude prices from the recent peak in early July. Headline inflation has ratcheted up in several advanced economies (AEs) as well as most emerging market economies (EMEs), prompting a few central banks in EMEs to tighten monetary policy. In contrast, sovereign bond yields have softened across AEs as markets seem to have acquiesced to the views of central banks that inflation is largely transitory. In EMEs, bond yields remain relatively high on inflation concerns and country-specific factors. In the foreign exchange market, EME currencies have depreciated in the wake of portfolio outflows since mid-June as risk appetite ebbed, while the US dollar has strengthened.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"On the domestic front, economic activity picked up pace in June-July as some states eased pandemic containment measures. As regards agriculture, the south-west monsoon regained intensity in mid-July after a lull; the cumulative rainfall up to August 1, 2021 was one per cent below the long-period average. The pace of sowing of kharif crops picked up in July along with some high frequency indicators of rural demand, notably tractor and fertiliser sales.Reflecting large base effects, industrial production expanded in double digits year-on-year (y-o-y) in May 2021 on top of the massive jump in April, but it was still 13.9 per cent below its May 2019 level. The manufacturing purchasing managers¡¯ index (PMI) that had dropped into contraction to 48.1 in June for the first time in 11 months, rebounded well into expansion zone with a reading of 55.3 in July. High-frequency indicators _ e-way bills; toll collections; electricity generation; air traffic; railway freight traffic; port cargo; steel consumption, cement production; import of capital goods; passenger vehicle sales; two wheeler sales _posted strong growth in June/July, reflecting adaptations to COVID related protocols and easing of containment. Services PMI remained in contractionary zone due to COVID-19 related restrictions, though the pace eased to 45.4 in July from 41.2 in June 2021. Initial quarterly results of non-financial corporates for Q1:2021-22 show healthy growth in sales, wage growth and profitability led by information technology firms.Headline CPI inflation plateaued at 6.3 per cent in June after having risen by 207 basis points in May 2021. Food inflation increased in June primarily due to an uptick in inflation in edible oils, pulses, eggs, milk and prepared meals and a pick-up in vegetable prices. Fuel inflation moved into double digits during May-June 2021 as inflation in LPG, kerosene, and firewood and chips surged. After rising sharply to 6.6 per cent in May, core inflation moderated to 6.1 per cent in June, driven by softening of inflation in housing, health, transport and communication, recreation and amusement, footwear, pan, tobacco and other intoxicants (as the effects of the one-off post-lockdown taxes imposed a year ago waned), and personal care and effects (due to sharp reduction in inflation in gold).System liquidity remained ample, with average daily absorption under the LAF increasing from _5.7 lakh crore in June to _6.8 lakh crore in July and further to _8.5 lakh crore in August so far (up to August 4, 2021). Auctions for a cumulative amount of _40,000 crore in Q2:2021-22 so far under the secondary market government securities acquisition programme (G-SAP) evened liquidity across illiquid segments of the yield curve. Reserve money (adjusted for the first-round impact of the changes in the cash reserve ratio) expanded by 11.0 per cent y-o-y on July 30, 2021 driven by currency demand. As on July 16, 2021, money supply (M3) and bank credit by commercial banks grew by 10.8 per cent and 6.5 per cent, respectively. India¡¯s foreign exchange reserves increased by US$ 43.1 billion in 2021-22 (up to end-July) to US$ 620.1 billion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Going forward, the revival of south-west monsoon and the pick-up in kharif sowing, buffered by adequate food stocks should help to control cereal price pressures. High frequency indicators suggest some softening of price pressures in edible oils and pulses in July in response to supply side interventions by the Government. Input prices are rising across manufacturing and services sectors, but weak demand and efforts towards cost cutting are tempering the pass-through to output prices. With crude oil prices at elevated levels, a calibrated reduction of the indirect tax component of pump prices by the Centre and states can help to substantially lessen cost pressures. Taking into consideration all these factors, CPI inflation is now projected at 5.7 per cent during 2021-22: 5.9 per cent in Q2; 5.3 per cent in Q3; and 5.8 per cent in Q4 of 2021-22, with risks broadly balanced. CPI inflation for Q1:2022-23 is projected at 5.1 per cent (Chart 1).Domestic economic activity is starting to recover with the ebbing of the second wave. Looking ahead, agricultural production and rural demand are expected to remain resilient. Urban demand is likely to mend with a lag as manufacturing and non-contact intensive services resume on a stronger pace, and the release of pent-up demand acquires a durable character with an accelerated pace of vaccination. Buoyant exports, the expected pick-up in government expenditure, including capital expenditure, and the recent economic package announced by the Government will provide further impetus to aggregate demand. Although investment demand is still anaemic, improving capacity utilisation and congenial monetary and financial conditions are preparing the ground for a long-awaited revival. Firms polled in the Reserve Bank surveys expect expansion in production volumes and new orders in Q2:2021-22, which is likely to sustain through Q4. Elevated levels of global commodity prices and financial market volatility are, however, the main downside risks. Taking all these factors into consideration, projection for real GDP growth is retained at 9.5 per cent in 2021-22 consisting of 21.4 per cent in Q1; 7.3 per cent in Q2; 6.3 per cent in Q3; and 6.1 per cent in Q4 of 2021-22. Real GDP growth for Q1:2022-23 is projected at 17.2 per cent (Chart 2).Inflationary pressures are being closely and continuously monitored. The MPC is conscious of its objective of anchoring inflation expectations. The outlook for aggregate demand is improving, but still weak and overcast by the pandemic. There is a large amount of slack in the economy, with output below its pre-pandemic level. The current assessment is that the inflationary pressures during Q1:2021-22 are largely driven by adverse supply shocks which are expected to be transitory. While the Government has taken certain steps to ease supply constraints, concerted efforts in this direction are necessary to restore supply-demand balance. The nascent and hesitant recovery needs to be nurtured through fiscal, monetary and sectoral policy levers. Accordingly, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 4 per cent and continue with an accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"With a view to increasing the focus of liquidity measures on revival of activity in specific sectors that have both backward and forward linkages and having multiplier effects on growth, the RBI had announced the On Tap TLTRO scheme on October 9, 2020 for five sectors which was available up to March 31, 2021. Stressed sectors identified by the Kamath Committee were also brought within the ambit of the scheme on December 4, 2020 and subsequently bank lending to NBFCs on February 5, 2021. On April 7, the scheme was extended by a period of six months, i.e., till September 30, 2021. Given the nascent and fragile economic recovery, it has now been decided to extend the On Tap TLTRO scheme further by a period of three months, i.e., till December 31, 2021.On March 27, 2020 banks were allowed to avail of funds under the marginal standing facility (MSF) by dipping into the Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) up to an additional one per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL), i.e., cumulatively up to 3 per cent of NDTL. This facility, which was initially available up to June 30, 2020 was later extended in phases up to March 31, 2021 and again for a further period of six months till September 30, 2021, providing comfort to banks on their liquidity requirements and also to enable them to meet their Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) requirements. This dispensation provides increased access to funds to the extent of _1.62 lakh crore and qualifies as high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) for the LCR. It has now been decided to continue with the MSF relaxation for a further period of three months, i.e., up to December 31, 2021.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) transition is a significant event that poses challenges for banks and the financial system. RBI has issued an advisory on June 8, 2021 encouraging banks and other RBI regulated entities to cease entering into new contracts that use LIBOR as a reference rate and instead adopt any Alternative Reference Rate (ARR) as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021. The Reserve Bank has been engaging with banks and market bodies to proactively take steps, as necessary, to ensure a smooth transition for regulated entities and financial markets. In this context, it has been decided to amend the guidelines related to export credit in foreign currency and restructuring of derivative contracts as detailed below.Authorized dealers are currently permitted to extend Pre-shipment Credit in Foreign Currency (PCFC) to exporters for financing the purchase, processing, manufacturing or packing of goods prior to shipment at LIBOR / EURO-LIBOR / EURIBOR related rates of interest. In view of the impending discontinuance of LIBOR as a benchmark rate, it has been decided to permit banks to extend export credit using any other widely accepted Alternative Reference Rate in the currency concerned.For derivative contracts, as per extant instructions, change in any of the parameters of the original contract is treated as a restructuring and the resultant change in the mark-to-market value of the contract on the date of restructuring is required to be cash settled. Since the impending change in reference rate from LIBOR is a ""force majeure"" event, banks are being advised that change in reference rate from LIBOR / LIBOR-related benchmarks to an Alternative Reference Rate will not be treated as restructuring.The resolution plans implemented under the Resolution Framework for COVID-19 related stress announced on August 6, 2020 are required to meet the sector specific thresholds notified in respect of five financial parameters, four of which are related to the operational performance of the borrowing entity, viz. Total Debt to EBIDTA ratio (Total Debt/EBIDTA), Current Ratio, Debt Service Coverage Ratio and Average Debt Service Coverage Ratio, by March 31, 2022. Recognising the adverse impact of second wave of COVID-19 on revival of businesses, and the difficulty it may pose in meeting the operational parameters, it has been decided to defer the target date for meeting the specified thresholds in respect of the above parameters to October 1, 2022.As regards the parameter Total Outside Liabilities/Adjusted Total Net Worth (TOL/ATNW), this ratio reflects the revised capital structure (i.e., debt-equity mix) as required under the implementation conditions for the resolution framework and was expected to be crystallised upfront as part of the resolution plan. Accordingly, the date for achieving the same remains unchanged, i.e. March 31, 2022.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Since the MPC¡¯s meeting in April, the global economic recovery has been gaining momentum, driven mainly by major advanced economies (AEs) and powered by massive vaccination programmes and stimulus packages. Activity remains uneven in major emerging market economies (EMEs), with downside risks from renewed waves of infections due to contagious mutants of the virus and the relatively slow progress in vaccination. World merchandise trade continues to recover as external demand resumes, though elevated freight rates and container dislocations are emerging as constraints. CPI inflation is firming up in most AEs, driven by release of pent-up demand, elevated input prices and unfavourable base effects. Inflation in major EMEs has been generally close to or above official targets in recent months, pushed up by the sustained rise in global food and commodity prices. Global financial conditions remain benign.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Turning to the domestic economy, provisional estimates of national income released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on May 31, 2021 placed India¡¯s real gross domestic product (GDP) contraction at 7.3 per cent for 2020-21, with GDP growth in Q4 at 1.6 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y). On June 1, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast a normal south-west monsoon, with rainfall at 101 per cent of the long period average (LPA). This augurs well for agriculture. With the rise in infections in rural areas, however, indicators of rural demand _ tractor sales and two-wheeler sales _ posted sequential declines during April.Industrial production registered a broad-based improvement in March 2021. While mining and electricity output surpassed March 2019 (pre-pandemic) levels, manufacturing did not catch up. The output of core industries registered a double digit y-o-y growth in April 2021, propelled by a weak base. Although GST collections were at their highest during April 2021, there are indications of moderation in May as reflected in lower E-way bills generation. Other high-frequency indicators _ electricity generation; railway freight traffic; port cargo; steel consumption; cement production; and toll collections _ recorded sequential moderation during April-May 2021, reflecting the impact of restrictions and localised lockdowns imposed by states with exemptions for specific activities. The manufacturing purchasing managers¡¯ index (PMI) remained in expansion in May although it moderated to 50.8 from 55.5 in April due to a slowdown in output and new orders. The services PMI, which was 54.0 in April, entered into contraction (46.4) in May, after seven months of sustained expansion.Headline inflation registered a moderation to 4.3 per cent in April from 5.5 per cent in March, largely on favourable base effects. Food inflation fell to 2.7 per cent in April from 5.2 per cent in March, with prices of cereals, vegetables and sugar continuing to decline on a y-o-y basis. While fuel inflation surged, core (CPI excluding food and fuel) inflation moderated in April across most sub-groups barring housing and health, mainly due to base effects. Inflation in transport and communication remained in double digits.System liquidity remained in large surplus in April and May 2021, with average daily net absorption under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) amounting to _5.2 lakh crore. Reserve money (adjusted for the first-round impact of the change in the cash reserve ratio) expanded by 12.4 per cent (y-o-y) on May 28, 2021, driven by currency demand. Money supply (M3) and bank credit grew by 9.9 per cent and 6.0 per cent, respectively, as on May 21, 2021 as compared with growth of 11.7 per cent and 6.2 per cent, respectively, a year ago. India¡¯s foreign exchange reserves increased by US$ 21.2 billion in 2021-22 (up to May 28) to US$ 598.2 billion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Going forward, the inflation trajectory is likely to be shaped by uncertainties impinging on the upside and the downside. The rising trajectory of international commodity prices, especially of crude, together with logistics costs, pose upside risks to the inflation outlook. Excise duties, cess and taxes imposed by the Centre and States need to be adjusted in a coordinated manner to contain input cost pressures emanating from petrol and diesel prices. A normal south-west monsoon along with comfortable buffer stocks should help to keep cereal price pressures in check. Recent supply side interventions are expected to ameliorate the tightness in the pulses market. Further supply side measures are needed to soften pressures on pulses and edible oil prices. With declining infections, restrictions and localised lockdowns across states could ease gradually and mitigate disruptions to supply chains, reducing cost pressures. Weak demand conditions may also temper the pass-through to core inflation. Taking into consideration all these factors, CPI inflation is projected at 5.1 per cent during 2021-22: 5.2 per cent in Q1; 5.4 per cent in Q2; 4.7 per cent in Q3; and 5.3 per cent in Q4:2021-22; with risks broadly balanced (Chart 1).Turning to the growth outlook, rural demand remains strong and the expected normal monsoon bodes well for sustaining its buoyancy, going forward. The increased spread of COVID-19 infections in rural areas, however, poses downside risks. Urban demand has been dented by the second wave, but adoption of new COVID-compatible occupational models by businesses for an appropriate working environment may cushion the hit to economic activity, especially in manufacturing and services sectors that are not contact intensive. On the other hand, the strengthening global recovery should support the export sector. Domestic monetary and financial conditions remain highly accommodative and supportive of economic activity. Moreover, the vaccination process is expected to gather steam in the coming months and should help to normalise economic activity quickly. Taking these factors into consideration, real GDP growth is now projected at 9.5 per cent in 2021-22, consisting of 18.5 per cent in Q1; 7.9 per cent in Q2; 7.2 per cent in Q3; and 6.6 per cent in Q4:2021-22 (Chart 2).The MPC notes that the second wave of COVID-19 has altered the near-term outlook, necessitating urgent policy interventions, active monitoring and further timely measures to prevent emergence of supply chain bottlenecks and build-up of retail margins. A hastened pace of the vaccination drive and quick ramping up of healthcare infrastructure across both urban and rural areas are critical to preserve lives and livelihoods and prevent a resurgence in new waves of infections. At this juncture, policy support from all sides _ fiscal, monetary and sectoral _ is required to nurture recovery and expedite return to normalcy. Accordingly, the MPC decided to retain the prevailing repo rate at 4 per cent and continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward.All members of the MPC _ Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das _ unanimously voted to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 4.0 per cent. Furthermore, all members of the MPC unanimously voted to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Since the MPC¡¯s meeting in February, lingering effects of the slowdown in the global economy in Q4 of 2020 have persisted, although recent arrivals of high frequency indicators suggest that a gradual but uneven recovery may be forming. The much anticipated boost to economic activity from the vaccination rollouts is being somewhat held back by new mutations of COVID-19, second and third waves of infections across countries and unequal access to vaccines more generally. World trade activity improved in Q4:2020 and January 2021. There are, however, concerns due to COVID-19-related fresh lockdowns and depressed demand in a few major economies, escalation in shipping charges and container shortages. Inflation remains benign in major advanced economies (AEs), although highly accommodative monetary policies and large fiscal stimuli have added to concerns around market-based indicators of inflation expectations, unsettling bond markets globally. In a few emerging market economies (EMEs), however, inflation is ruling above targets, primarily driven by firming global commodity prices. This has even prompted a few of them to raise policy rates. Equity and currency markets have been turbulent with the increase in long-term bond yields and the steepening of yield curves. More recently, however, calm has returned and major equity markets have scaled new peaks in March, while currencies are trading mixed against a generally firming US dollar. With the bond markets sell-offs, EME assets came under selling pressure and capital outflows imposed depreciating pressures on EME currencies in March.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The second advance estimates for 2020-21 released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on February 26, 2021 placed India¡¯s real gross domestic product (GDP) contraction at 8.0 per cent during the year. High frequency indicators _ vehicle sales; railway freight traffic; toll collections; goods and services tax (GST) revenues; e-way bills; and steel consumption _ suggest that gains in manufacturing and services activity in Q3:2020-21 extended into Q4. Purchasing managers¡¯ index (PMI) manufacturing at 55.4 in March 2021 remained in expansion zone, but lower than its level in February. The index of industrial production slipped into marginal contraction in January 2021, dragged down by manufacturing and mining. Core industries also contracted in February. The resilience of agriculture is evident from foodgrains and horticulture production for 2020-21, which are expected to be 2.0 per cent and 1.8 per cent higher respectively than the final estimates of 2019-20.Headline inflation increased to 5.0 per cent in February after having eased to 4.1 per cent in January 2021. Within an overall food inflation print of 4.3 per cent in February, five out of twelve food sub-groups recorded double digit inflation. While fuel inflation pressures eased somewhat in February, core inflation registered a generalised hardening and increased by 50 basis points to touch 6 per cent.System liquidity remained in large surplus in February and March 2021 with average daily net liquidity absorption of _5.9 lakh crore. Driven by currency demand, reserve money (RM) increased by 14.2 per cent (y-o-y) as on March 26, 2021. Money supply (M3) grew by 11.8 per cent as on March 26, 2021 with credit growth at 5.6 per cent. Corporate bond issuances at _6.8 lakh crore during 2020-21 (up to February 2021) were higher than _6.1 lakh crore during the same period last year. Issuances of commercial paper (CPs) turned around since December 2020 and were higher by 10.4 per cent during December 2020 to March 2021 than in the same period of the previous year. India¡¯s foreign exchange reserves increased by US$ 99.2 billion during 2020-21 to US$ 577.0 billion at end-March 2021, providing an import cover of 18.4 months and 102 per cent of India¡¯s external debt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The evolving CPI inflation trajectory is likely to be subjected to both upside and downside pressures. The bumper foodgrains production in 2020-21 should sustain softening of cereal prices going forward. While the prices of pulses, particularly tur and urad, remain elevated, the incoming rabi harvest arrivals in the markets and the overall increase in domestic production in 2020-21 should augment supply which, along with imports, should enable some softening of these prices going forward. While edible oils inflation has been ruling at heightened levels with international prices remaining firm, reduction of import duties and appropriate incentives to enhance productivity domestically could work towards a better demand-supply balance over the medium-term. Pump prices of petroleum products have remained high. Reduction of excise duties and cesses and state level taxes could provide some relief to consumers on top of the recent easing of international crude prices. This could slow down the propagation of second-round effects. The impact of high international commodity prices and increased logistics costs are being felt across manufacturing and services. Finally, inflation expectations of urban households one year ahead showed a marginal increase than over the three months ahead horizon according to the Reserve Bank¡¯s March 2021 survey. Taking into consideration all these factors, CPI inflation is now projected as 5.0 per cent in Q4:2020-21; 5.2 per cent in Q1:2021-22, 5.2 per cent in Q2, 4.4 per cent in Q3 and 5.1 per cent in Q4, with risks broadly balanced (Chart 1).Turning to the growth outlook, rural demand remains buoyant and record agriculture production for 2020-21 bodes well for its resilience. Urban demand has been gaining strength on the back of normalisation of economic activity and should get a fillip with the ongoing vaccination drive. The fiscal stimulus from increased allocation for capital expenditure under the Union Budget 2021-22, expanded production-linked incentives (PLI) scheme and rising capacity utilisation (from 63.3 per cent in Q2 to 66.6 per cent in Q3:2020-21) should provide strong support to investment demand and exports. Firms engaged in manufacturing, services and infrastructure polled by the Reserve Bank in March 2021 were optimistic about a pick-up in demand and expansion in business activity into 2021-22. Consumer confidence, on the other hand, has dipped with the recent surge in COVID infections in some states imparting uncertainty to the outlook. Taking these factors into consideration, the projection of real GDP growth for 2021-22 is retained at 10.5 per cent consisting of 26.2 per cent in Q1, 8.3 per cent in Q2, 5.4 per cent in Q3 and 6.2 per cent in Q4 (Chart 2).The MPC notes that the supply side pressures on inflation could persist. It also notes that demand-side pull remains moderate. While cost-push pressures have risen, they could be partially offset with the normalisation of global supply chains. On imported inflation from global commodity prices, urgent concerted and coordinated policy actions by Centre and States can mitigate domestic input costs such as taxes on petrol and diesel and high retail margins. The renewed jump in COVID-19 infections in certain parts of the country and the associated localised lockdowns could dampen the demand for contact-intensive services, restrain growth impulses and prolong the return to normalcy. In such an environment, continued policy support remains necessary. Taking these developments into consideration, the MPC decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward.All members of the MPC _ Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das _ unanimously voted for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged.

other,,"The global economic recovery slackened in Q4 (October-December) of 2020 relative to Q3 (July-September) as several countries battle second waves of COVID-19 infections, including more virulent strains. With massive vaccination drives underway, risks to the recovery may abate and economic activity is expected to gain momentum in the second half of 2021. In its January 2021 update, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised upward its estimate of global growth in 2020 to (-)3.5 per cent from (-)4.4 per cent and increased the projection of global growth for 2021 by 30 basis points to 5.5 per cent. Barring some emerging market economies, inflation remains benign on weak aggregate demand, although rising commodity prices carry upside risks. Financial markets remain buoyant, supported by easy monetary conditions, abundant liquidity and optimism from the vaccine rollout. Global trade is also expected to rebound in 2021, with services trade on a slower recovery than merchandise trade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The first advance estimates of GDP for 2020-21 released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on January 7, 2021 estimated real GDP to contract by 7.7 per cent, in line with the projection of (-)7.5 per cent set out in the December 2020 resolution of the MPC. High frequency indicators _ railway freight traffic; toll collection; e-way bills; and steel consumption _ suggest that revival of some constituents of the services sector gained traction in Q3 (October-December). The agriculture sector remains resilient - rabi sowing was higher by 2.9 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) as on January 29, 2021, supported by above normal north-east monsoon rainfall and adequate reservoir level of 61 per cent (as on February 4, 2021) of full capacity, above the 10 years average of 50 per cent.After breaching the upper tolerance threshold of 6 per cent for six consecutive months (June-November 2020), CPI inflation fell to 4.6 per cent in December on the back of easing food prices and favourable base effects. Food inflation collapsed to 3.9 per cent in December after averaging 9.6 per cent during the previous three months (September-November) due to a sharp correction in vegetable prices and softening of cereal prices with kharif harvest arrivals, alongside supply side interventions. On the other hand, core inflation, i.e. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel remained elevated at 5.5 per cent in December with marginal moderation from a month ago. In the January 2021 round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s survey, inflation expectations of households softened further over a three month ahead horizon in tandem with the moderation in food inflation; one year ahead inflation expectations, however, remained unchanged.Systemic liquidity remained in large surplus in December 2020 and January 2021, engendering easy financial conditions. Reserve money rose by 14.5 per cent y-o-y (on January 29, 2021), led by currency demand. Money supply (M3), on the other hand, grew by only 12.5 per cent as on January 15, 2021, but with non-food credit growth of scheduled commercial banks accelerating to 6.4 per cent. Corporate bond issuances at _5.8 lakh crore during April-December 2020 were higher than _4.6 lakh crore in the same period of last year. India¡¯s foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 590.2 billion on January 29, 2021 _ an increase of US$ 112.4 billion over end-March 2020.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"With the larger than anticipated deflation in vegetable prices in December bringing down headline closer to the target, it is likely that the food inflation trajectory will shape the near-term outlook. The bumper kharif crop, rising prospects of a good rabi harvest, larger winter arrivals of key vegetables and softer egg and poultry demand on avian flu fears are factors auguring a benign inflation outcome in the months ahead. On the other hand, price pressures may persist in respect of pulses, edible oils, spices and non-alcoholic beverages. The outlook for core inflation is likely to be impacted by further easing in supply chains; however, broad-based escalation in cost-push pressures in services and manufacturing prices due to increase in industrial raw material prices could impart upward pressure. Furthermore, there could be increased pass-through to output prices as demand normalises as indicated in the Reserve Bank¡¯s industrial outlook, services and infrastructure outlook surveys and purchasing managers¡¯ indices (PMIs) and firms regain pricing power. International crude oil prices may remain supported by demand build up on optimism from vaccination and continuing production cuts by OPEC plus. The crude oil futures curve has become downward sloping since December 2020. Taking into consideration all these factors, the projection for CPI inflation has been revised to 5.2 per cent in Q4:2020-21, 5.2 per cent to 5.0 per cent in H1:2021-22 and 4.3 per cent in Q3: 2021-22, with risks broadly balanced (Chart 1).Turning to the growth outlook, rural demand is likely to remain resilient on good prospects of agriculture. Urban demand and demand for contact-intensive services is expected to strengthen with the substantial fall in COVID-19 cases and the spread of vaccination. Consumer confidence is reviving and business expectations of manufacturing, services and infrastructure remain upbeat. The fiscal stimulus under AtmaNirbhar 2.0 and 3.0 schemes of government will likely accelerate public investment, although private investment remains sluggish amidst still low capacity utilisation. The Union Budget 2021-22, with its thrust on sectors such as health and well-being, infrastructure, innovation and research, among others, should help accelerate the growth momentum. Taking these factors into consideration, real GDP growth is projected at 10.5 per cent in 2021-22 _ in the range of 26.2 to 8.3 per cent in H1 and 6.0 per cent in Q3 (Chart 2).The MPC notes that the sharp correction in food prices has improved the food price outlook, but some pressures persist, and core inflation remains elevated. Pump prices of petrol and diesel have reached historical highs. An unwinding of taxes on petroleum products by both the centre and the states could ease the cost push pressures. What is needed at this point is to create conditions that result in a durable disinflation. This is contingent also on proactive supply side measures. Growth is recovering, and the outlook has improved significantly with the rollout of the vaccine programme in the country. The Union Budget 2021-22 has introduced several measures to provide an impetus to growth. The projected increase in capital expenditure augurs well for capacity creation thereby improving the prospects for growth and building credibility around the quality of expenditure. The recovery, however, is still to gather firm traction and hence continued policy support is crucial. Taking these developments into consideration, the MPC in its meeting today decided to continue with an accommodative stance of monetary policy till the prospects of a sustained recovery are well secured while closely monitoring the evolving outlook for inflation.All members of the MPC _ Dr. Shashanka Bhide; Dr. Ashima Goyal; Prof. Jayanth R. Varma; Dr. Mridul K. Saggar; Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra; and Shri Shaktikanta Das _ unanimously voted for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged at 4 per cent. Furthermore, all members of the MPC voted to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary _ at least during the current financial year and into the next financial year _ to revive growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"With a view to increasing the focus of liquidity measures on revival of activity in specific sectors that have both backward and forward linkages and having multiplier effects on growth, the RBI had announced the TLTRO on Tap Scheme on October 9, 2020 which is available up to March 31, 2021. In addition to the five sectors announced under the scheme on October 21, 2020, 26 stressed sectors identified by the Kamath Committee were also brought within the ambit of sectors eligible under on tap TLTRO on December 4, 2020. Liquidity availed by banks under the scheme is to be deployed in corporate bonds, commercial paper, and non-convertible debentures issued by entities in these sectors. The liquidity availed under the scheme can also be used to extend bank loans and advances to these sectors. Investments made by banks under this facility can be classified as held to maturity (HTM) even above the 25 per cent of total investment permitted to be included in the HTM portfolio. All exposures under this facility are exempted from reckoning under the large exposure framework (LEF). Given that NBFCs are well recognised conduits for reaching out last mile credit and act as a force multiplier in expanding credit to various sectors, it is now proposed to provide funds from banks under the TLTRO on Tap scheme to NBFCs for incremental lending to these sectors.To help banks tide over the disruption caused by COVID-19, the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of all banks was reduced by 100 basis points to 3.0 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) effective from the reporting fortnight beginning March 28, 2020. The dispensation was available for a period of one year ending March 26, 2021. On a review of monetary and liquidity conditions, it has been decided to gradually restore the CRR in two phases in a non-disruptive manner. Banks would now be required to maintain the CRR at 3.5 per cent of NDTL effective from the reporting fortnight beginning March 27, 2021 and 4.0 per cent of NDTL effective from fortnight beginning May 22, 2021.On March 27, 2020 banks were allowed to avail of funds under the marginal standing facility (MSF) by dipping into the Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) up to an additional one per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL), i.e., cumulatively up to 3 per cent of NDTL. This facility, which was initially available up to June 30, 2020 was later extended in phases up to March 31, 2021 providing comfort to banks on their liquidity requirements and also to enable them to meet their Liquidity Coverage ratio (LCR) requirements. This dispensation provides increased access to funds to the extent of _1.53 lakh crore and qualifies as high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) for the LCR. With a view to providing comfort to banks on their liquidity requirements, it has now been decided to continue with the MSF relaxation for a further period of six months, i.e., up to September 30, 2021.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This dispensation was made available up to March 31, 2022. In order to provide certainty to the market participants in the context of the borrowing programme of the centre and states for 2021-22, it has now been decided to extend the dispensation of enhanced HTM of 22 per cent up to March 31, 2023 to include securities acquired between April 1, 2021 and March 31, 2022. The HTM limits would be restored from 22 per cent to 19.5 per cent in a phased manner starting from the quarter ending June 30, 2023. It is expected that banks will be able to plan their investments in SLR securities in an optimal manner with a clear glide path for restoration of HTM limits.In order to incentivise new credit flow to the micro, small, and medium enterprise (MSME) borrowers, Scheduled Commercial Banks will be allowed to deduct credit disbursed to ¡®New MSME borrowers¡¯ from their Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL) for calculation of the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR). For the purpose of this exemption, ¡¯New MSME borrowers¡¯ shall be defined as those MSME borrowers who have not availed any credit facilities from the banking system as on January 1, 2021.

Considering the continuing stress on account of COVID-19, and in order to aid in the recovery process, it has been decided to defer the implementation of the last tranche of the CCB of 0.625 per cent from April 1, 2021 to October 1, 2021.As part of the regulatory measures taken in the wake of COVID-19, the implementation of Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) by banks in India had been deferred to April 1, 2021. While banks are comfortably placed on the liquidity front, in view of the continued stress on account of COVID-19, it has been decided to defer the implementation of NSFR to October 1, 2021.Recently, the Reserve Bank has released a discussion paper on Revised Regulatory Framework for NBFCs _ A Scale Based Approach. Taking into consideration the constantly evolving milieu in the financial sector, it is proposed to review the regulatory framework for Non-Banking Financial Company - Micro Finance Institutions (NBFC-MFIs). There is a case for having a framework which is uniformly applicable to all regulated lenders in the microfinance space including scheduled commercial banks, small finance banks and NBFC-Investment and Credit Companies, rather than prescribing these guidelines for NBFC-MFIs alone. Accordingly, the RBI will come out with a consultative document harmonising the regulatory frameworks for various regulated lenders in the microfinance space in March 2021.Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks are an important segment of the credit structure. The provisions of the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Act, 2020 are applicable to Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks (UCBs) with effect from June 26, 2020. The amendments have brought near parity in regulatory and supervisory powers between UCBs and commercial banks in respect of regulatory powers including those related to governance, audit and resolution. Consequently, a comprehensive review of regulatory/supervisory approach towards the sector is required in the light of these amendments. Accordingly, it has been decided to set up an Expert Committee on UCBs involving all stakeholders in order to provide a medium-term road map to strengthen the sector, enable faster rehabilitation/resolution of UCBs, as well as to examine other critical aspects relating to these entities. The constitution of the Committee as well as the terms of reference will be notified separately.At present, resident individuals are not allowed to make remittances to IFSCs established in India under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS). In order to deepen the financial markets in IFSCs and provide an opportunity to resident individuals to diversify their portfolio, on a review, it has been decided to permit resident individuals to make remittances to IFSCs established in India under the Scheme. Since remittances towards current account transactions like travel, education, gifts and capital account transactions like purchase of immovable property are not relevant with respect to IFSCs in India, remittances will be permitted only for making investments in securities issued by the non-resident entities in IFSCs. Resident Individuals may also open a non-interest bearing Foreign Currency Account (FCA) in IFSCs for making investments under LRS. The funds in the FCA shall be used only for the purpose of making permissible investments in IFSC and any funds lying idle in the account shall be repatriated to resident account of the investor in India within a period of 15 days from receipt.

As part of continuing efforts to increase retail participation in government securities and to improve ease of access, it has been decided to move beyond aggregator model and provide retail investors online access to the government securities market _ both primary and secondary - along with the facility to open their gilt securities account (¡®Retail Direct¡¯) with the RBI.

In order to further promote investment by FPIs in corporate bonds, it is proposed to extend similar exemptions to defaulted corporate bonds. Accordingly, FPI investment in defaulted corporate bonds will be exempted from the short-term limit and the minimum residual maturity requirement under the MTF.

The Payment Systems Vision document of RBI envisages setting up a 24x7 helpline for addressing customer queries in respect of various digital payment products. The helpline will, in addition to building trust and confidence, also reduce expenditure on both financial and human resources, otherwise incurred for addressing queries and grievances. The major payment system operators would be required to facilitate setting-up of a centralised industry-wide 24x7 helpline for addressing customer queries in respect of various digital payment products and give information on available grievance redress mechanisms by September 2021. Going forward, the facility of registering and resolving the customer complaints through the helpline shall be considered.The operators and participants of various authorised payment systems carry out a bouquet of specialised activities on account of the products offered by them and design of payment systems they operate. Often, such activities are outsourced to optimise efficiency and lower costs. However, vulnerabilities in the systems of entities who provide such outsourced services can pose cyber security risks to the principal entity. To manage the attendant risks in outsourcing and ensure that a code of conduct is adhered to while outsourcing payment and settlement related services, the Reserve Bank shall issue guidelines to operators and participants of authorised payment systems.The Cheque Truncation System (CTS) is in use since 2010 and presently covers around 1,50,000 branches across three cheque processing grids. All the erstwhile 1219 non-CTS clearing houses have since been migrated to CTS. It is observed that about 18,000 bank branches are still outside any formal clearing arrangement. In order to bring operational efficiency in paper based clearing and make the process of collection and settlement of cheques faster resulting in better customer service, it is proposed to bring all such branches under the CTS clearing mechanism by September 2021. Separate operational guidelines will be issued in a month¡¯s time.Financial consumer protection has gained significant policy priority across jurisdictions. In line with the global initiatives on consumer protection, RBI has taken various initiatives to strengthen Grievance Redress Mechanism of regulated entities. As an alternate dispute resolution mechanism, three Ombudsman schemes, i.e. (i) Banking Ombudsman Scheme (ii) Ombudsman Scheme for Non-Banking Financial Companies and (iii) Ombudsman Scheme for Digital Transactions are in operation from 22 ombudsman offices of RBI located across the country. RBI had operationalised complaint management system (CMS) portal as one stop solution for alternate dispute resolution of customer complaints not resolved satisfactorily by the regulated entities. To make the alternate dispute redress mechanism simpler and more responsive to the customers of regulated entities, it has been decided to implement, inter alia, integration of the three Ombudsman schemes and adoption of the ¡®One Nation One Ombudsman¡¯ approach for grievance redressal. This is intended to make the process of redress of grievances easier by enabling the customers of the banks, NBFCs and non-bank issuers of PPIs to register their complaints under the integrated scheme, with one centralised reference point.

Progress on vaccine candidates has, however, generated some offsetting optimism. World trade recorded a rebound in Q3 as lockdowns were eased, but it is likely to slow in Q4 as pent-up demand is exhausted, inventory restocking is completed, and trade-related uncertainty is rising with the second wave. CPI inflation has remained muted across major advanced economies (AEs) while it picked up in some EMEs on firming food prices and supply disruptions.

other,,"In India, the data release of the National Statistical Office (NSO) on November 27 showed a contraction of 7.5 per cent in real GDP in Q2:2020-21 (July-September). In Q3:2020-21, high frequency indicators point to a recovery gaining traction, with double digit growth in passenger vehicles and motorcycle sales, railway freight traffic, and electricity consumption in October, although there was moderation in some of these indicators in November. Riding on the favourable monsoon, the outlook for agriculture remains bright, with rabi sowing up 4.0 per cent from the acreage covered at this time last year under supportive soil moisture and reservoir conditions.CPI inflation rose sharply to 7.3 per cent in September and further to 7.6 per cent in October 2020, with some evidence that price pressures are spreading. Food inflation surged to double digits in October across protein-rich items including pulses, edible oils, vegetables and spices on multiple supply shocks. Core inflation, i.e., CPI excluding food and fuel, also picked up from 5.4 per cent in September to 5.8 per cent in October. Both three months and one year ahead inflation expectations of households have eased modestly in anticipation of the seasonal moderation of food prices in the winter and easing of supply chain disruptions.Domestic financial conditions remained easy in October-November and systemic liquidity continued to be in large surplus. Reserve money increased by 15.3 per cent (y-o-y) (as on November 27, 2020), driven by a surge in currency demand. Money supply (M3), on the other hand, grew by only 12.5 per cent as on November 20, 2020. A noteworthy development is that non-food credit growth accelerated and moved into positive territory for the first time in November 2020 on a financial year basis _ hitherto, the large inflow of deposits into the banking system was being predominantly deployed in SLR investment. Corporate bond issuances stood at _4.4 lakh crore during April-October 2020 as against _3.5 lakh crore during the same period last year.

other,,"The outlook for inflation has turned adverse relative to expectations in the last two months. The substantial wedge between wholesale and retail inflation points to the supply-side bottlenecks and large margins being charged to the consumer. While cereal prices may continue to soften with the bumper kharif harvest arrivals and vegetable prices may ease with the winter crop, other food prices are likely to persist at elevated levels. Crude oil prices have picked up on optimism of demand recovery, continuation of OPEC plus production cuts and are expected to remain volatile in the near-term. Cost-push pressures continue to impinge on core inflation, which has remained sticky and could firm up as economic activity normalises and demand picks up. Taking into consideration all these factors, CPI inflation is projected at 6.8 per cent for Q3:2020-21, 5.8 per cent for Q4:2020-21; and 5.2 per cent to 4.6 per cent in H1:2021-22, with risks broadly balanced (Chart 1).Turning to the growth outlook, the recovery in rural demand is expected to strengthen further, while urban demand is also gaining momentum as unlocking spurs activity and employment, especially of labour displaced by COVID-19. These positive impulses are, however, clouded by a possible rise in infections in some parts of the country, prompting some local containment measures. At the same time, the recovery rate has crossed 94 per cent and there is considerable optimism on successes in vaccine trials. Consumers remain optimistic about the outlook, and business sentiment of manufacturing firms is gradually improving. Fiscal stimulus is increasingly moving beyond being supportive of consumption and liquidity to supporting growth-generating investment. On the other hand, private investment is still slack and capacity utilisation has not fully recovered. While exports are on an uneven recovery, the prospects have brightened with the progress on the vaccines. Demand for contact-intensive services is likely to remain subdued for some time due to social distancing norms and risk aversion. Taking these factors into consideration, real GDP growth is projected at (-)7.5 per cent in 2020-21: (+)0.1 per cent in Q3:2020-21 and (+)0.7 per cent in Q4:2020-21; and (+)21.9 per cent to (+)6.5 per cent in H1:2021-22, with risks broadly balanced (Chart 2).The MPC is of the view that inflation is likely to remain elevated, barring transient relief in the winter months from prices of perishables. This constrains monetary policy at the current juncture from using the space available to act in support of growth. At the same time, the signs of recovery are far from being broad-based and are dependent on sustained policy support. A small window is available for proactive supply management strategies to break the inflation spiral being fuelled by supply chain disruptions, excessive margins and indirect taxes. Further efforts are necessary to mitigate supply-side driven inflation pressures. Monetary policy will monitor closely all threats to price stability to anchor broader macroeconomic and financial stability. Accordingly, the MPC in its meeting today decided to maintain status quo on the policy rate and continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary _ at least during the current financial year and into the next financial year _ to revive growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward.All members of the MPC _ Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das _ unanimously voted for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged. Further, all members of the MPC voted unanimously to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary _ at least during the current financial year and into the next financial year _ to revive growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Global trade is expected to be subdued. The rebound could turn out to be stronger among advanced economies (AEs) than in emerging market economies (EMEs). Global financial markets remain supported by highly accommodative monetary and liquidity conditions. Soft fuel prices and weak aggregate demand have kept inflation below target in AEs, although in some EMEs, supply disruptions have imparted upward price pressures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"On the domestic front, high frequency indicators suggest that economic activity is stabilising in Q2:2020-21 after the 23.9 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) decline in real GDP in Q1 (April-June). Cushioned by government spending and rural demand, manufacturing _ especially consumer non-durables _ and some categories of services, such as passenger vehicles and railway freight, have gradually recovered in Q2. The outlook for agriculture is robust. With merchandise exports slowly catching up to pre-COVID levels and some moderation in the pace of contraction of imports, the trade deficit widened marginally sequentially in Q2.Headline CPI inflation increased to 6.7 per cent during July-August 2020 as pressures accentuated across food, fuel and core constituents on account of supply disruptions, higher margins and taxes. One year ahead inflation expectations of households suggest some softening in inflation from three months ahead levels. Selling prices of firms remain muted, reflecting the weak demand conditions.Domestic financial conditions have eased substantially, with systemic liquidity remaining in large surplus. Reserve money increased by 13.5 per cent on a year-on-year basis (as on October 2, 2020), driven by a surge in currency demand (21.5 per cent). Growth in money supply (M3), however, was contained at 12.2 per cent as on September 25, 2020. Banks¡¯ non-food credit growth remains subdued.

other,,"Turning to the outlook for inflation, kharif sowing portends well for food prices. Pressures on prices of key vegetables like tomatoes, onions and potatoes should also ebb by Q3 with kharif arrivals. On the other hand, prices of pulses and oilseeds are likely to remain firm due to elevated import duties. International crude oil prices have traded with a softening bias in September on a weak demand outlook, but domestic pump prices may remain elevated in the absence of any roll back of taxes. Pricing power of firms remains weak in the face of subdued demand. COVID-19-related supply disruptions, including labour shortages and high transportation costs, could continue to impose cost-push pressures, but these risks are getting mitigated by progressive easing of lockdowns and removal of restrictions on inter-state movements. Taking into consideration all these factors, CPI inflation is projected at 6.8 per cent for Q2:2020-21, at 5.4-4.5 per cent for H2:2020-21 and 4.3 per cent for Q1:2021-22, with risks broadly balanced (Chart 1).Turning to the growth outlook, the recovery in the rural economy is expected to strengthen further, while the turnaround in urban demand is likely to be lagged in view of social distancing norms and the elevated number of COVID-19 infections. While the contact-intensive services sector will take time to regain pre-COVID levels, manufacturing firms expect capacity utilisation to recover in Q3:2020-21 and activity to gain some traction from Q4 onwards. Both private investment and exports are likely to be subdued, especially as external demand is still anaemic. Taking into consideration the above factors and the uncertain COVID-19 trajectory, real GDP growth in 2020-21 is expected to be negative at (-)9.5 per cent, with risks tilted to the downside: (-)9.8 per cent in Q2:2020-21; (-)5.6 per cent in Q3; and 0.5 per cent in Q4. Real GDP growth for Q1:2021-22 is placed at 20.6 per cent (Chart 2).The MPC is of the view that revival of the economy from an unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic assumes the highest priority in the conduct of monetary policy. While inflation has been above the tolerance band for several months, the MPC judges that the underlying factors are essentially supply shocks which should dissipate over the ensuing months as the economy unlocks, supply chains are restored, and activity normalises. Accordingly, they can be looked through at this juncture while setting the stance of monetary policy. Taking into account all these factors, the MPC decides to maintain status quo on the policy rate in this meeting and await the easing of inflationary pressures to use the space available for supporting growth further.All members of the MPC _ Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Prof. Jayanth R.

While the uneasy and differently-paced withdrawal of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions in some countries enabled a sequential improvement in high frequency indicators during May-July, a renewed surge in COVID-19 infections in major economies and threats of a second wave of infections appear to have weakened these early signs of revival. Contractions in economic activity have been more severe in Q2:2020 than in Q1, and the near-term outlook points to a slow, uneven and hesitant recovery pushed into the second half of the year, with risks steeply slanted to the downside. Among advanced economies (AEs), output in the US and the Euro area underwent a deeper contraction in Q2:2020 than in the preceding quarter. Emerging market economies (EMEs) are expected to shrink in Q2 as reflected in high frequency indicators.Global financial markets have rebounded since end-March 2020 with intermittent pauses, shrugging off the volatility and sharp correction recorded in Q1:2020. Portfolio flows returned to EMEs in Q2 after a massive reversal, though there was moderation in July from the previous month¡¯s level. EME currencies have also appreciated in close co-movement, tracking weakening of the US dollar. Crude oil prices have remained supported on supply cuts by oil producing countries (OPEC plus) and improved demand prospects on the gradual easing of lockdown restrictions since May. Gold prices have rallied to an all-time high on August 5 on the back of safe haven demand. In AEs, benign fuel prices and soft aggregate demand have kept inflation subdued. In many EMEs, however, cost-push pressures arising from supply disruptions and demand revival have shown up in consumer prices in June 2020. Global food prices are elevated across the board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"On the domestic front, economic activity had started to recover from the lows of April-May following the uneven re-opening of some parts of the country in June; however, surges of fresh infections have forced re-clamping of lockdowns in several cities and states. Consequently, several high frequency indicators have levelled off.The agricultural sector has emerged as a bright spot. Its prospects have strengthened on the back of good spatial and temporal progress of the south-west monsoon. The cumulative monsoon rainfall was 1 per cent below the long-period average (LPA) up to August 5, 2020. Spurred by the expanding precipitation, the total area sown under kharif crops on July 31 was 5.9 per cent higher than the normal area measured by the average over the period 2014-15 to 2018-19. As on July 30, 2020, the live storage in major reservoirs was 41 per cent of the full reservoir level (FRL), which bodes well for the rabi season. These developments have had a salutary effect on rural demand as reflected in fertiliser production and sales of tractors, motorcycles and fast-moving consumer goods.The pace of contraction of industrial production, measured by the index of industrial production (IIP), moderated to (-) 34.7 per cent in May from (-) 57.6 per cent a month ago, with the easing of lockdowns in different parts of the country. All manufacturing sub-sectors, except pharmaceuticals, remained in negative territory. The output of core industries in June contracted for the fourth successive month though with a considerable moderation. The Reserve Bank¡¯s business assessment index (BAI) for Q1:2020-21 hit its lowest mark in the survey¡¯s history. The manufacturing PMI remained in contraction, shrinking further to 46.0 in July from 47.2 in the preceding month.High frequency indicators of services sector activity for May-June indicate signs of a modest resumption of economic activity, especially in rural areas, although at levels lower than a year ago. Notably, the decline in passenger vehicle sales moderated to (-) 49.6 per cent in June from (-) 85.3 per cent in May, indicative of tentative urban demand, and faster recovery of sales in rural areas. On the other hand, domestic air passenger traffic and cargo traffic continued to post sharp contraction. Construction activity remained tepid _ cement production fell and finished steel consumption moderated sharply in June. Imports of capital goods _ a key indicator of investment activity _ declined further in June. The services PMI continued in contractionary zone in July to 34.2, although the downturn eased relative to the May and June readings.The National Statistical Office (NSO) released data on headline CPI for the month of June 2020 on July 13, 2020, along with imputed back prints of the index for April and May 2020. This resulted in a sharp upward revision of food inflation for the month of April and May. During Q1:2020-21 food inflation moderated from 10.5 per cent in April to 7.3 per cent in June 2020. Meanwhile, fuel inflation edged up as international kerosene and LPG prices firmed up. Inflation excluding food and fuel was at 5.4 per cent in June, reflecting a spike in prices across most sub-groups. Inflation in transport and communication, personal care and effects, pan-tobacco and education registered significant increases in June. Headline CPI inflation, which was at 5.8 per cent in March 2020 was placed at 6.1 per cent in the provisional estimates for June 2020.For the second successive round, households¡¯ three months ahead expectations remained above their one year ahead expectations, indicating their anticipation of lower inflation over the longer horizon. Producers¡¯ sentiments on input prices remained muted as their salary outgoes fell. Their selling prices contracted in Q1 in the April-June round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s industrial outlook survey. The contraction in output prices is also corroborated by firms participating in the manufacturing PMI survey. Domestic financial conditions have eased substantially and systemic liquidity remains in large surplus, due to the conventional and unconventional measures by the Reserve Bank since February 2020. Cumulatively, these measures assured liquidity of the order of _9.57 lakh crore or 4.7 per cent of GDP. Reflecting these developments, reserve money (RM) increased by 15.4 per cent on a year-on-year basis (as on July 31, 2020), driven by a surge in currency demand (23.1 per cent). Growth in money supply (M3), however, was contained at 12.4 per cent as on July 17, 2020. Average daily net absorptions under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) moderated from _5.3 lakh crore in May 2020 to _4.1 lakh crore in June as government spending slowed. In July, average daily net absorptions under the LAF moderated further to _4.0 lakh crore, as government spending remained subdued. During 2020-21 (up to July 31), _1,24,154 crore was injected through open market operation (OMO) purchases. In order to distribute liquidity more evenly across the term structure and improve transmission, the Reserve Bank conducted ¡®operation twist¡¯ auctions involving the simultaneous sale and purchase of government securities for _10,000 crore on July 2, 2020. Furthermore, the utilisation of refinance provided by the Reserve Bank to the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) and the National Housing Bank (NHB) increased to _34,566 crore on July 31, 2020 from _22,334 crore during the May policy.The transmission to bank lending rates has improved further, with the weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans declining by 91 bps during March-June 2020. The spreads of 3-year AAA rated corporate bonds over G-Secs of similar maturity declined from 276 bps on March 26, 2020 to 50 bps by end-July 2020. Even for the lowest investment grade bonds (BBB-), spreads have come down by 125 bps by end-July 2020. Lower borrowing costs have led to record primary issuance of corporate bonds of _2.1 lakh crore in the first quarter of 2020-21.India¡¯s merchandise exports contracted for the fourth successive month in June 2020, although the pace of fall moderated on improving shipments of agriculture and pharmaceutical products. Imports fell sharply in June in a broad-based manner, reflecting weak domestic demand and low international crude oil prices. The merchandise trade balance recorded a surplus in June (US$ 0.8 billion), after a gap of over 18 years. The current account balance turned into a marginal surplus of 0.1 per cent of GDP in Q4 of 2019-20 as against a deficit of 0.7 per cent a year ago. On the financing side, net foreign direct investment moderated to US$ 4.4 billion in April-May 2020 from US$ 7.2 billion a year ago. In 2020-21 (till July 31), net foreign portfolio investment (FPI) in equities at US$ 5.3 billion was higher than US$ 1.2 billion a year ago. In the debt segment, however, there were outflows of US$ 4.4 billion during the same period as against inflows of US$ 2.0 billion a year ago. Net investment under the voluntary retention route increased by US$ 0.9 billion during the same period. India¡¯s foreign exchange reserves have increased by US$ 56.8 billion in 2020-21 so far (up to July 31) to US$ 534.6 billion _ equivalent to 13.4 months of imports.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Supply chain disruptions on account of COVID-19 persist, with implications for both food and non-food prices. A more favourable food inflation outlook may emerge as the bumper rabi harvest eases prices of cereals, especially if open market sales and public distribution offtake are expanded on the back of significantly higher procurement. The relatively moderate increases in minimum support prices (MSP) for the kharif crops and monsoon are also supportive of benign inflation prospects. Nonetheless, upside risks to food prices remain. The abatement of price pressure in key vegetables is delayed and remains contingent upon normalisation of supplies. Protein based food items could also emerge as a pressure point, given the tight demand-supply balance in the case of pulses. The inflation outlook of non-food categories is, however, fraught with uncertainty. Higher domestic taxes on petroleum products have resulted in elevated domestic pump prices and will impart broad-based cost-push pressures going forward. Volatility in financial markets and rising asset prices also pose upside risks to the outlook. Taking into consideration all these factors, headline inflation may remain elevated in Q2:2020-21, but may moderate in H2:2020-21 aided by large favourable base effects.Turning to the growth outlook, the recovery in the rural economy is expected to be robust, buoyed by the progress in kharif sowing. Manufacturing firms responding to the Reserve Bank¡¯s industrial outlook survey expect domestic demand to recover gradually from Q2 and to sustain through Q1:2021-22. On the other hand, consumer confidence turned more pessimistic in July relative to the preceding round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s survey. External demand is expected to remain anaemic under the weight of the global recession and contraction in global trade. Taking into consideration the above factors, real GDP growth in Q2-Q4 is expected to evolve along the lines noted in the May resolution. For the year 2020-21, as a whole, real GDP growth is expected to be negative. An early containment of the COVID-19 pandemic may impart an upside to the outlook. A more protracted spread of the pandemic, deviations from the forecast of a normal monsoon and global financial market volatility are the key downside risks.The June release of headline inflation after a gap of two months and imputed prints of the CPI for April-May have added uncertainty to the inflation outlook. The NSO has adopted best practices in producing these imputations for the purpose of business continuity in the face of challenges to data collection due to the nation-wide lockdown. The NSO has, however, not provided inflation rates for April and May. For the purpose of monetary formulation and conduct, therefore, the MPC is of the view that CPI prints for April and May can be regarded as a break in the CPI series.The MPC noted that the economy is experiencing unprecedented stress in an austere global environment. Extreme uncertainty characterises the outlook, which is heavily contingent upon the intensity, spread and duration of the pandemic _ particularly the heightened risks associated with a second wave of infections _ and the discovery of the vaccine. In these conditions, supporting the recovery of the economy assumes primacy in the conduct of monetary policy. In pursuit of this objective, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative as long as it is necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy. While space for further monetary policy action in support of this stance is available, it is important to use it judiciously and opportunistically to maximise the beneficial effects for underlying economic activity.At the same time, the MPC is conscious that its primary mandate is to achieve the medium-term target for CPI inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent. It also recognises that the headline CPI prints of April-May, 2020 require more clarity. At the current juncture, the inflation objective itself is further obscured by (a) the spike in food prices because of floods in eastern India and ongoing lockdown related disruptions; and (b) cost-push pressures in the form of high taxes on petroleum products, hikes in telecom charges, rising raw material costs reflected in upward revisions in steel prices and rise in gold prices on safe haven demand. Given the uncertainty surrounding the inflation outlook and taking into consideration the extremely weak state of the economy in the midst of an unprecedented shock from the ongoing pandemic, it is prudent to pause and remain watchful of incoming data as to how the outlook unravels.Meanwhile, the cumulative reduction of 250 basis points since February 2019 is working its way through the economy, lowering interest rates in money, bond and credit markets, and narrowing down spreads. Financing conditions have eased considerably, enabling financial flows via financial markets, especially at a time when banks remain highly risk averse. Accordingly, the MPC decides to stay on hold with regard to the policy rate and remain watchful for a durable reduction in inflation to use the available space to support the revival of the economy.All members of the MPC _ Dr. Chetan Ghate, Dr. Pami Dua, Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das _ unanimously voted for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged and continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Global economic activity has come to a near standstill as COVID-19 related lockdowns and social distancing are imposed across a widening swathe of affected countries. Expectations of a shallow recovery in 2020 from 2019¡¯s decade low in global growth have been dashed. The outlook is now heavily contingent upon the intensity, spread and duration of the pandemic. There is a rising probability that large parts of the global economy will slip into recession.Financial markets have become highly volatile from January onwards due to the outbreak of COVID-19. Panic sell-offs have resulted in wealth destruction in equity markets across advanced and emerging economies alike. In the former, flight to safety has pulled down government bond yields to record lows with some hardening in recent days. In the latter, the rush to exit has rendered fixed income markets illiquid and resulted in firming up of yields. Emerging and advanced economy currencies are experiencing severe depreciation pressure on a daily basis because of fire sales due to extreme risk aversion. At this point, only the US dollar remains safe haven in a highly uncertain outlook. Japanese yen and gold _ the other two safe havens till the early part of March _ have given way to a flight to cash. International crude prices initially traded with a softening bias from January in anticipation of demand weakening due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Production cut disagreements among key oil producers, however, set off retaliatory supply scale-ups and a price war that plunged international Brent crude prices to a low of US$ 25 per barrel on March 18, 2020. These developments are likely to dampen inflation across advanced and emerging economies. Central banks and governments are in war mode, responding to the situation with several conventional and unconventional measures targeted at easing financial conditions to avoid a demand collapse and to prevent financial markets from freezing up due to illiquidity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The second advance estimates of the National Statistics Office released in February 2020 implied real GDP growth of 4.7 per cent for Q4:2019-20 within the annual estimate of 5 per cent for the year as a whole. This is now at risk from the pandemic¡¯s impact on the economy. High frequency indicators suggest that private final consumption expenditure has been hit hardest, even as gross fixed capital formation has been in contraction since Q2:2019-20. On the supply side, the outlook for agriculture and allied activities appears to be the only silver lining, with foodgrains output at 292 million tonnes being 2.4 per cent higher than a year ago. A pick-up in manufacturing and electricity generation pulled industrial production into positive territory in January 2020 after intermittent contraction and/or lacklustre activity over the past five months; however, more data will need to be watched to assess whether the recent uptick will endure in the face of COVID-19. Meanwhile, most service sector indicators for January and February 2020 moderated or declined. Since then anecdotal evidence suggests that several services such as trade, tourism, airlines, the hospitality sector and construction have been further adversely impacted by the pandemic. Dislocations in casual and contract labour would result in losses of activity in other sectors as well. Retail inflation, measured by the consumer price index, peaked in January 2020 and fell by a full percentage point in February 2020 to 6.6 per cent, as the ebbing of onion prices brought down food inflation from double digits in the preceding two months. Price pressures, however, remain firm across protein-rich items, edible oils and pulses; but the shock to demand from COVID-19 may weaken them going forward. While fuel inflation increased sharply in February on the back of the delayed domestic adjustment to international LPG prices, the plunge in international crude prices in March may bring a measure of relief to the extent it is allowed to pass-through. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel eased in February under the weight of softer prices of transport and communication, and personal care. Households¡¯ inflation expectations a year ahead softened by 20 bps in the March 2020 round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s survey.Domestic financial conditions have tightened considerably, with equity markets facing massive sell-offs by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs). In the bond market too, yields have risen on sustained FPI selling, while redemption pressures, drop in trading activity and generalised risk aversion have pushed up yields to elevated levels in commercial paper, corporate bond and other fixed income segments. In the forex market, the Indian rupee (INR) has been under continuous downward pressure. Under these conditions, the Reserve Bank has endeavoured to keep financial markets liquid, stable and functioning normally. Systemic liquidity surplus, as reflected in net absorptions under the LAF, averaged _ 2.86 lakh crore in March (up to March 25, 2020). In addition, the Reserve Bank undertook unconventional operations in the form of auctions of what is called ¡®operation twist¡¯ involving the simultaneous sale of short-term government securities (of _ 28,276 crore) and purchase of long-term securities (of _ 40,000 crore), cumulatively injecting a net amount of _ 11,724 crore. The Reserve Bank also conducted five long term repo auctions of 1 year and 3 years tenors of a cumulative amount of _ 1.25 lakh crore so far to inject liquidity and improve monetary transmission. It also conducted two sell-buy swap auctions to inject cumulatively US dollar liquidity into the forex market to the tune of US$ 2.71 billion on March 16 and 23. Open market purchase operations of _ 10,000 crore on March 20 and _ 15,000 crore each on March 24 and March 26 have been conducted to bolster liquidity and smoothen financial conditions.In the external sector, merchandise exports expanded in February 2020 after posting six consecutive months of contraction. Import growth also moved into positive territory after eight months of continuous decline. Consequently, the trade deficit widened marginally on a year-on-year basis although it was lower than its level a month ago. On March 12, the Reserve Bank released balance of payments data which showed the current account having moved to near balance in Q3:2019-20 with a deficit of only 0.2 per cent of GDP. On the financing side, net FDI inflows at US$ 37.8 billion during April-January 2019-20 were substantially higher than a year ago. Portfolio investment recorded net outflows of US$ 5.2 billion during 2019-20 (up to March 25), down from US$ 6.6 billion a year ago. India¡¯s foreign exchange reserves reached a level of US$ 487.2 billion on March 6, 2020 _ an increase of US$ 74.4 billion over their end-March 2019 level.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"In the sixth bi-monthly resolution of February 2020, CPI headline inflation was projected at 6.5 per cent for Q4:2019-20. The prints for January and February 2020 indicate that actual outcomes for the quarter are running 30 bps above projections, reflecting the onion price shock. Looking ahead, food prices may soften even further under the beneficial effects of the record foodgrains and horticulture production, at least till the onset of the usual summer uptick. Furthermore, the collapse in crude prices should work towards easing both fuel and core inflation pressures, depending on the level of the pass-through to retail prices. As a consequence of COVID-19, aggregate demand may weaken and ease core inflation further. Heightened volatility in financial markets could also have a bearing on inflation.Turning to growth, apart from the continuing resilience of agriculture and allied activities, most other sectors of the economy will be adversely impacted by the pandemic, depending upon its intensity, spread and duration. If COVID-19 is prolonged and supply chain disruptions get accentuated, the global slowdown could deepen, with adverse implications for India. The slump in international crude prices could, however, provide some relief in the form of terms of trade gains. Downside risks to growth arise from the spread of COVID-19 and prolonged lockdowns. Upside growth impulses are expected to emanate from monetary, fiscal and other policy measures and the early containment of COVID-19.The MPC is of the view that macroeconomic risks, both on the demand and supply sides, brought on by the pandemic could be severe. The need of the hour is to do whatever is necessary to shield the domestic economy from the pandemic. Central banks across the world have responded with monetary and regulatory measures _ both conventional and unconventional. Governments across the world have unleashed massive fiscal measures, including targeted health services support, to protect economic activity from the impact of the virus. To mitigate the economic difficulties arising out of the virus outbreak, the Government of India has announced a comprehensive package of _ 1.70 lakh crore, covering cash transfers and food security, for vulnerable sections of society, including farmers, migrant workers, urban and rural poor, differently abled persons and women. The MPC notes that the Reserve Bank has taken several measures to inject substantial liquidity in the system. Nonetheless, the priority is to undertake strong and purposeful action in order to minimise the adverse macroeconomic impact of the pandemic. It is in this context that the MPC unanimously votes for a sizable reduction in the policy repo rate, but with some differences in the quantum of reduction. Furthermore, the MPC also notes that the Reserve Bank has decided to undertake several measures to further improve liquidity, monetary transmission and credit flows to the economy and provide relief on debt servicing. It also underscores the need for all stakeholders to fight against the pandemic. Banks and other financial institutions should do all they can to keep credit flowing to economic agents facing financial stress on account of the isolation that the virus has imposed. Market participants should work with regulators like the Reserve Bank and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to ensure the orderly functioning of markets in their role of price discovery and financial intermediation. Strong fiscal measures are critical to deal with the situation.All members voted for a reduction in the policy repo rate and maintaining the accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Since the MPC met last in December 2019, global economic activity has remained slow-paced, but is getting differentiated across geographies. Among the key advanced economies (AEs), the US economy grew by 2.1 per cent in Q4:2019, the same pace as in Q3, with slack in consumer spending offset by government expenditure. In the euro area, economic activity slowed down in Q4 as France and Italy shrank unexpectedly amid waning consumer confidence. Growth momentum in the UK appears to have weakened in Q4 as reflected in a decline in industrial production and tepid retail sales. The Japanese economy was weighed down in Q4 by weak retail sales as reflected in subdued consumer spending in the wake of the sales tax hike in October. Industrial production in Japan was pulled down by muted global demand.Among emerging market economies (EMEs), the Chinese economy slowed down to a 29-year low of 6.1 per cent in 2019, caused by sluggish domestic demand and prolonged trade tensions. In Russia, available indicators point to a loss of momentum in activity in Q4:2019 with industrial production easing, although private consumption may have provided some cushion. In Brazil, activity seems to have slowed down, as reflected in a contraction in industrial production and depressed retail sales. The South African economy recorded a growth of -0.6 per cent in Q3 and is likely to have also contracted in Q4 as industrial production slumped and household spending remained subdued amidst lingering consumer pessimism.Crude oil and gold prices shot up in early January sparked by the US-Iran confrontation, but both softened from mid-January as geo-political tensions eased. By end-January, crude oil prices dipped sharply due to sell-offs triggered by the outbreak of the coronavirus. Gold prices, on the other hand, inched up towards end-January because of safe haven demand. International food prices have been rising on higher demand and supply disruptions from major exporting countries. Reflecting these developments, inflation has edged up in some major AEs and EMEs.Global financial markets remained resilient in December 2019 and for the most part of January 2020 as thawing US-China trade relations and improved prospects of an orderly Brexit buoyed investors¡¯ sentiment. Equity markets rallied across AEs and EMEs, turning bearish towards end-January with the outbreak of the coronavirus as markets braced up for the likely adverse impact on growth prospects, particularly in China. However, equity markets in most economies recovered some of the losses in early February. Bond yields, which had hardened in the US towards the end of 2019 as investors turned to riskier assets, softened in January 2020, especially after the US Fed left the policy rate unchanged and assured the extension of repo operations. In the euro area, bond yields sank further into negative territory in January. Yields also softened across several EMEs. In currency markets, the US dollar strengthened in January against major advanced economies in sympathy with factors impacting US bond markets. EME currencies, which were generally trading with an appreciating bias, have depreciated since the last week of January.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Moving on to the domestic economy, the first advance estimates (FAE) released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on January 7, 2020 placed India¡¯s real gross domestic product (GDP) growth for 2019-20 at 5.0 per cent. In its January 31 release, the NSO revised real GDP growth for 2018-19 to 6.1 per cent from 6.8 per cent given in the provisional estimates of May 2019. On the supply side, growth of real gross value added (GVA) is estimated at 4.9 per cent in 2019-20 as compared with 6.0 per cent in 2018-19.Turning to more recent indicators, both production and imports of capital goods _ two key pointers of investment activity _ continued to contract in November/December, though at a moderate pace compared with the previous month. Revenue expenditure of the Centre (excluding interest payments and subsidies) remained robust in Q3, indicative of the counter-cyclical buffer to domestic demand being provided by government final consumption. As per revised estimates given in the Union Budget, growth in revenue expenditure of the Centre (excluding interest payments and subsidies) is estimated to be lower in Q4 compared with Q3.On the supply side, rabi sowing has been higher by 9.5 per cent up to January 31, 2020 compared with a year ago. The north east monsoon rainfall was above normal. Storage in major reservoirs _ the main source of irrigation during the rabi season _ was 70 per cent of the full reservoir level (as on January 30, 2020) as compared with 45 per cent a year ago. Based on the first advance estimates, horticulture production is estimated to have risen 0.8 per cent to a record level in 2019-20. Production of vegetables is estimated to have increased by 2.6 per cent in 2019-20 due to higher production of onions, potatoes and tomatoes. Industrial activity, measured by the index of industrial production (IIP), improved in November after contracting in the previous three months. The output of core industries returned to positive territory in December after four months of contraction, buoyed by five out of eight of its constituents _ coal; refinery products; fertilisers; steel; and cement. Capacity utilisation (CU) in the manufacturing sector, measured by the Reserve Bank¡¯s order books, inventory and capacity utilisation survey (OBICUS), fell to 69.1 per cent in Q2 from 73.6 per cent in Q1; seasonally adjusted CU also eased to 70.3 per cent from 73.4 per cent. The Reserve Bank¡¯s industrial outlook survey points to weak demand conditions facing the manufacturing sector in Q3:2019-20. The Reserve Bank¡¯s business expectations index suggests an improvement in Q4. This is corroborated by the manufacturing purchasing managers¡¯ index (PMI) for January 2020 which picked up sharply to 55.3 from 51.2 in November 2019 on the back of increased output and new orders.Several high frequency indicators of services have turned upwards in the recent period, pointing to a modest revival in momentum, although the outlook is still muted. Amongst indicators of rural demand, while tractor sales grew by 2.4 per cent in December after ten months of a decline, motorcycle sales continued to contract. Domestic air passenger traffic _ an indicator of urban demand _ posted double digit growth in November, followed by a modest growth in December. Growth in three-wheeler sales and railway freight traffic has accelerated, while port traffic turned around in December. On the other hand, passenger vehicle sales continued to contract. The PMI services index improved to 55.5 in January 2020 from 52.7 in November 2019, boosted by a rise in new business and output.Retail inflation, measured by year-on-year changes in the CPI, surged from 4.6 per cent in October to 5.5 per cent in November and further to 7.4 per cent in December 2019, the highest reading since July 2014. While food group inflation rose to double digits, the fuel group moved out of deflation. Inflation in CPI excluding food and fuel continued to edge up from its October trough.CPI food inflation increased from 6.9 per cent in October to 12.2 per cent in December, primarily caused by a spike in onion prices due to unseasonal rains in October-November. Excluding onions, food inflation would have been lower by 4.7 percentage points and headline inflation by 2.1 percentage points in December. In addition, inflation in several other food sub-groups such as milk, pulses, cereals, edible oils, eggs, meat and fish also firmed up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Overall liquidity in the system remained in surplus in December 2019 and January 2020. Average daily net absorption under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) amounted to _ 2.61 lakh crore in December 2019. In January 2020, the average daily net absorption of surplus liquidity soared to _ 3.18 lakh crore. The Reserve Bank conducted four auctions involving the simultaneous purchase of long-term and sale of short-term government securities under open market operations (OMOs) for a notified amount of _ 10,000 crore each during December and January (December 23 and 30, 2019 and January 6 and 23, 2020). Reflecting these operations, the 10-year G-sec yield softened cumulatively by 15 bps between December 19, 2019 and January 31, 2020. During the intervening period, however, the yields fell by as much as 25 bps. The weighted average call rate (WACR) traded below the policy repo rate (on an average) by 10 bps in December and by 19 bps in January on easy liquidity conditions. Monetary transmission across various money market segments and the private corporate bond market has been sizable. As against the cumulative reduction in the policy repo rate by 135 bps since February 2019, transmission to various money and corporate debt market segments up to January 31, 2020 ranged from 146 bps (overnight call money market) to 190 bps (3-month CPs of non-banking finance companies). Transmission through the longer end of government securities market was at 73 bps (5-year government securities) and 76 bps (10-year government securities). Transmission to the credit market is gradually improving. The 1-year median marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) declined by 55 bps during February 2019 and January 2020. The weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans sanctioned by banks declined by 69 bps and the WALR on outstanding rupee loans by 13 bps during February-December 2019.After the introduction of the external benchmark system, most banks have linked their lending rates for housing, personal and micro and small enterprises (MSEs) to the policy repo rate of the Reserve Bank. During October-December 2019, the WALRs of domestic (public and private sector) banks on fresh rupee loans declined by 18 bps for housing loans, 87 bps for vehicle loans and 23 bps for loans to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).Export growth continued to contract in November-December 2019, reflecting the slowdown in global trade. Import growth slumped in November-December 2019, with contraction in both oil and non-oil non-gold imports. While the latter reflected the underlying weakness in domestic demand and was spread across categories such as transport equipment, coal, iron and steel and chemicals, outgoes on account of oil imports were lower due to a cut back in oil import volume. Gold imports also declined in December 2019. On the financing side, net foreign direct investment rose to US$ 24.4 billion in April-November 2019 from US$ 21.2 billion a year ago. Net foreign portfolio investment was of the order of US$ 8.6 billion in 2019-20 (up to February 4) as against net outflows of US$ 14.2 billion in the same period last year. In addition, net investments by FPIs under the voluntary retention route have aggregated US$ 7.8 billion since March 11, 2019. External commercial borrowings were higher at US$ 13.4 billion during April-December 2019 as compared with US$ 2.5 billion during the same period a year ago. India¡¯s foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 471.4 billion on February 4, 2020 _ an increase of US$ 58.5 billion over end-March 2019.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"In the fifth bi-monthly resolution of December 2019, CPI inflation was projected at 5.1-4.7 per cent for H2:2019-20 and 4.0-3.8 per cent for H1:2020-21, with risks broadly balanced. The actual inflation outcome for Q2 at 5.8 per cent overshot projections by 70 bps, primarily due to the intensification of the onion price shock in December 2019 on account of unseasonal rains in October-November.Going forward, the inflation outlook is likely to be influenced by several factors. First, food inflation is likely to soften from the high levels of December and the decline is expected to become more pronounced during Q4:2019-20 as onion prices fall rapidly in response to arrivals of late kharif and rabi harvests. Higher vegetables production, despite the early loss due to unseasonal rain, is also likely to have a salutary impact on food inflation. On the other hand, the recent pick-up in prices of non-vegetable food items, specifically in milk due to a rise in input costs, and in pulses due to a shortfall in kharif production, are all likely to sustain. These factors could impart some upward bias to overall food prices. Second, crude prices are likely to remain volatile due to unabating geo-political tensions in the Middle East on the one hand, and the uncertain global economic outlook on the other. Third, there has been an increase in input costs for services, in recent months. However, subdued demand conditions, muted pricing power of corporates and the correction in energy prices since the last week of January may limit the pass-through to selling prices. Fourth, domestic financial markets remain volatile reflecting both global and domestic factors, which may have an influence on the inflation outlook. Fifth, base effects would turn favourable during Q3:2020-21. Sixth, the increase in customs duties on items of retail consumption in the budget may result in only a marginal one-time uptick in inflation. Taking into consideration these factors, and under the assumption of a normal south west monsoon in 2020-21, the CPI inflation projection is revised upwards to 6.5 per cent for Q4:2019-20; 5.4-5.0 per cent for H1:2020-21; and 3.2 per cent for Q3:2020-21, with risks broadly balanced (Chart 1).Turning to the growth outlook, real GDP growth for 2019-20 was projected in the December 2019 policy at 5.0 per cent _ 4.9-5.5 per cent in H2. GDP growth for H1:2020-21 was projected at 5.9-6.3 per cent. For 2020-21, the growth outlook will be influenced by several factors. First, private consumption, particularly in rural areas, is expected to recover on the back of improved rabi prospects. The recent rise in food prices has shifted the terms of trade in favour of agriculture, which will support rural incomes. Second, the easing of global trade uncertainties should encourage exports and spur investment activity. The breakout of the coronavirus may, however, impact tourist arrivals and global trade. Third, monetary transmission in terms of a reduction in lending rates and financial flows to the commercial sector has progressed vis-¨¤-vis the last policy, and this could spur both consumption and investment demand. Fourth, the rationalisation of personal income tax rates in the Union Budget 2020-21 should support domestic demand along with measures to boost rural and infrastructure spending. Taking into consideration the above factors, GDP growth for 2020-21 is projected at 6.0 per cent _ in the range of 5.5-6.0 per cent in H1 and 6.2 per cent in Q3 (Chart 2).The MPC notes that inflation has surged above the upper tolerance band around the target in December 2019, primarily on the back of the unusual spike in onion prices. Over the coming weeks and months, onion prices are likely to ebb as supply conditions improve. The salutary effects on headline inflation are, however, likely to be tempered by hardening of prices of other food items, notably those of pulses and proteins. Meanwhile adjustments to telecom charges are imparting cost-push pressures to CPI inflation excluding food and fuel. Going forward, the trajectory of inflation excluding food and fuel needs to be carefully monitored as the pass-through of remaining revisions in mobile phone charges, the increase in prices of drugs and pharmaceuticals and the impact of new emission norms play out and feed into inflation formation. The MPC anticipates that the combination of these factors may keep headline inflation elevated in the short-run, at least through H1:2020-21. Overall, the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain. Accordingly, the MPC will remain vigilant about the potential generalisation of inflationary pressures as several of the underlying factors cited earlier appear to be operating in concert.At the same time, the MPC observes that the economy continues to be weak and the output gap remains negative. While some high-frequency indicators have turned around and point to a lift in the momentum of economic activity, there is a need to await incoming data to gauge their sustainability. Financial flows to the commercial sector have improved in recent months. The Union Budget 2020-21 has introduced several measures to provide an impetus to growth. While the emphasis on boosting the rural economy and infrastructure should help the growth momentum in the near-term, the corporate tax rate cuts of September 2019 should help boost the growth potential over the medium-term. The fiscal deficit of the Central Government for 2019-20 is placed at 3.8 per cent of GDP in the revised estimates as against 3.3 per cent of GDP in the budget estimates. The higher fiscal deficit in 2019-20 has not resulted in an increase in market borrowings compared to the budget estimates. The fiscal deficit is budgeted to decline to 3.5 per cent of GDP for 2020-21. Fresh gross market borrowings are budgeted to increase by _ 70,000 crore to _ 7.8 lakh crore in 2020-21 from _ 7.1 lakh crore in 2019-20. The MPC notes that while there is a need for adjustment in interest rates on small saving schemes, the external benchmark system introduced from October 1, 2019 has strengthened monetary transmission. These developments should amplify the effects of the cumulative policy rate reductions undertaken by the Reserve Bank since February 2019 and pull up domestic demand going forward.The outlook for inflation is highly uncertain at this juncture. On the other hand, economic activity remains subdued and the few indicators that have moved up recently are yet to gain traction in a more broad-based manner. Given the evolving growth-inflation dynamics, the MPC felt it appropriate to maintain status quo. Accordingly, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged and persevere with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive growth, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Global economic activity has slowed down since the meeting of the MPC in June 2019, amidst elevated trade tensions and geo-political uncertainty. Among advanced economies (AEs), GDP growth in the US decelerated in Q2:2019 on weak business fixed investment. In the Euro area too, GDP growth moderated in Q2 on worsening external conditions. Economic activity in the UK was subdued in Q2 with waning consumer confidence on account of Brexit related uncertainty and weak industrial production. In Japan, available data on industrial production and consumer confidence suggest that growth is likely to be muted in Q2.Economic activity remained weak in major emerging market economies (EMEs), pulled down mainly by slowing external demand. The Chinese economy decelerated to a multi-year low in Q2, while in Russia subdued economic activity in Q1 continued into Q2 on slowing exports and retail sales. In Brazil, the economy is struggling to gain momentum after contracting in Q1 on weak service sector activity and declining industrial production. Economic activity in South Africa appears to be losing pace in Q2 as the manufacturing purchasing managers¡¯ index (PMI) contracted for the sixth month in succession in June and business confidence remained weak.Crude oil prices fell sharply in mid-May on excess supplies from an increase in non-OPEC production, combined with a further weakening of demand. Consequently, extension of OPEC production cuts in early July did not have much impact on prices. Gold prices have risen sharply since the last week of May, propelled by increased safe haven demand amidst rising downside risks to growth and a worsening geo-political situation. Inflation remained benign in major advanced and emerging market economies.Financial markets were driven by the monetary policy stances of major central banks and intensifying geo-political tensions. In the US, the equity market recovered most of the losses suffered in May, boosted by dovish guidance by the US Fed and some transient respite in trade tensions with China. EM stocks lagged behind their developed market counterparts, mainly reflecting the weak performance of Chinese and South Korean stocks. Bond yields in the US, which were already trading with a softening bias on increased probability of policy rate cuts, fell markedly in early August on escalation of trade tensions. Bond yields in some more member countries in the Euro area moved into negative territory as expectations of more accommodative monetary policy by the European Central Bank gained traction. In EMEs, bond yields edged lower on more accommodative guidance by systemic central banks. In currency markets, the US dollar weakened against major currencies in June on dovish guidance by the US Fed but appreciated in July. EME currencies, which traded with an appreciating bias in July, depreciated in early August on escalation of trade tensions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"On the domestic front, the south-west monsoon gained intensity and spread with the cumulative rainfall 6 per cent below the long-period average (LPA) up to August 6, 2019. In terms of its spatial distribution, 25 of the 36 sub-divisions received normal or excess rainfall as against 28 sub-divisions last year. The total area sown under kharif crops was 6.6 per cent lower as on August 2 than a year ago. The live storage in major reservoirs on August 1 was at 33 per cent of the full reservoir level as compared with 45 per cent a year ago. Rainfall during the second half of the season (August-September) has been forecast to be normal by the India Meteorological Department (IMD).Industrial growth, measured by the index of industrial production (IIP), moderated in May 2019, pulled down by manufacturing and mining even as electricity generation picked up on strong demand. In terms of the use-based classification, the production of capital goods and consumer durables decelerated. However, consumer non-durables accelerated for the third consecutive month in May. The growth in the index of eight core industries decelerated in June, dragged down by a contraction in petroleum refinery products, crude oil, natural gas and cement. Capacity utilisation (CU) in the manufacturing sector, measured by the order books, inventory and capacity utilisation survey (OBICUS) of the Reserve Bank rose marginally to 76.1 per cent in Q4:2018-19 from 75.9 per cent in Q3; seasonally adjusted CU, however, fell to 74.5 per cent in Q4 from 75.6 per cent in Q3. The Reserve Bank¡¯s business assessment index (BAI) for Q1:2019-20 improved marginally, supported by a modest recovery in profit margins of the surveyed firms even as production and order books slowed. The manufacturing PMI rose to 52.5 in July from 52.1 in June, underpinned by a pick-up in production, higher new orders and optimism on demand conditions in the year ahead.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"High frequency indicators of services sector activity for May-June present a mixed picture. Tractor and motorcycle sales _ indicators of rural demand _ continued to contract. Amongst indicators of urban demand, passenger vehicle sales contracted for the eighth consecutive month in June; however, domestic air passenger traffic growth turned positive in June after three consecutive months of contraction. Commercial vehicle sales slowed down even after adjusting for base effects. Construction activity indicators slackened, with contraction in cement production and slower growth in finished steel consumption in June. Import of capital goods _ a key indicator of investment activity _ contracted in June. The services PMI expanded to 53.8 in July from 49.6 in June on increase in new business activity, new export orders and employment.Retail inflation, measured by y-o-y change in the CPI, edged up to 3.2 per cent in June from 3.0 per cent in April-May, driven by food inflation, even as fuel inflation and CPI inflation excluding food and fuel moderated.Inflation in the food group rose to 2.4 per cent in June from 2.0 per cent in May and 1.4 per cent in April, caused by a sharp pick up in prices of meat and fish, pulses and vegetables. Inflation also edged up in cereals, milk, spices and prepared meals. However, inflation in eggs and non-alcoholic beverages softened. Prices of fruits, and sugar and confectionery remained in deflation in June.Inflation in the fuel and light group moderated in June, with electricity moving into deflation. Fuels such as firewood and chips, and dung cake have been in deflation from April. Inflation in liquified petroleum gas (LPG) and subsidised kerosene prices, however, remained elevated.CPI inflation excluding food and fuel fell by 50 basis points to 4.1 per cent in May from 4.6 per cent in April, and remained unchanged in June. The softness in inflation in this category was broad-based across clothing and footwear; household goods and services; transport and communication; and recreation and amusement. Housing inflation remained unchanged over the last three months. Despite some moderation, inflation in the health sub-group remained elevated. Inflation in personal care and effects edged up in June due to a resurgence in gold prices.Inflation expectations of households remained unchanged in the July 2019 round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s survey for the three months ahead horizon as compared with the previous round, but they moderated by 20 basis points for the one year ahead horizon. Input cost pressures from prices of agricultural and industrial raw materials continued to ease in May and June. Nominal growth in rural wages was muted, while growth in staff costs in the manufacturing sector eased in Q1. Manufacturing firms participating in the Reserve Bank¡¯s industrial outlook survey expect input cost pressures to soften on account of lower raw material costs in Q2.Liquidity in the system was in large surplus in June-July 2019 due to (i) return of currency to the banking system; (ii) drawdown of excess cash reserve ratio (CRR) balances by banks; (iii) open market operation (OMO) purchase auctions; and (iv) the Reserve Bank¡¯s foreign exchange market operations. The Reserve Bank absorbed liquidity of _ 51,710 crore in June, _ 1,30,931 crore in July and _ 2,04,921 crore in August (up to August 6, 2019) on a daily net average basis under the LAF. Two OMO purchase auctions amounting to _ 27,500 crore were conducted in June, thereby injecting durable liquidity into the system. The weighted average call money rate (WACR) _ the operating target of monetary policy _ was aligned with the policy repo rate in June, but it traded below the policy repo rate on a daily average basis by 14 bps in July and 17 bps in August (up to August 6, 2019).The transmission of policy repo rate cuts to the weighted average lending rates (WALRs) on fresh rupee loans of banks has improved marginally since the last meeting of the MPC. Overall, banks reduced their WALR on fresh rupee loans by 29 bps during the current easing phase so far (February-June 2019). Merchandise exports contracted in June 2019, weighed down by the subdued performance of gems and jewellery, petroleum products, rice, engineering goods and cotton. After a modest increase in May, imports also contracted in June, impacted by falling prices of petroleum products and reduced imports of pearls and precious stones, transport equipment, machinery, metalliferous ores, chemicals and fertilisers. As the fall in imports was larger than that of exports, the trade deficit declined modestly during May-June on a y-o-y basis. Provisional data suggest a sequential decline in net services exports in May 2019. On the financing side, net foreign direct investment flows moderated to US$ 6.8 billion in April-May 2019 from US$ 7.9 billion a year ago. Net foreign portfolio investment (FPI) flows in the domestic capital market amounted to US$ 2.3 billion during the current financial year so far (up to August 5, 2019) as against net outflows of US$ 8.5 billion in the same period last year. India¡¯s foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 429.0 billion on August 2, 2019 _ an increase of US$ 16.1 billion over end-March 2019.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"In the second bi-monthly monetary policy resolution of June 2019, CPI inflation was projected at 3.0-3.1 per cent for H1:2019-20 and 3.4-3.7 per cent for H2:2019-20, with risks broadly balanced. The actual headline inflation outcome for Q1:2019-20 at 3.1 per cent was in alignment with these projections.The baseline inflation trajectory for the next four quarters will be shaped by several factors. First, the uptick in food inflation may be sustained by price pressures in vegetables and pulses as more recent data suggest. Uneven spatial and temporal distribution of monsoon could exert some upward pressure on food items, though this risk is likely to be mitigated by the recent catch up in rainfall. Second, despite excess supply conditions, crude oil prices may likely remain volatile due to geo-political tensions in the Middle-East. Third, the outlook for CPI inflation excluding food and fuel remains soft. Manufacturing firms participating in the industrial outlook survey expect output prices to ease in Q2. Fourth, one year ahead inflation expectations of households polled by the Reserve Bank have moderated. Taking into consideration these factors and the impact of recent policy rate cuts, the path of CPI inflation is projected at 3.1 per cent for Q2:2019-20 and 3.5-3.7 per cent for H2:2019-20, with risks evenly balanced. CPI inflation for Q1:2020-21 is projected at 3.6 per cent (Chart 1).In the MPC¡¯s June resolution, real GDP growth for 2019-20 was projected at 7.0 per cent _ in the range of 6.4-6.7 per cent for H1:2019-20 and 7.2-7.5 per cent for H2 _ with risks evenly balanced. Various high frequency indicators suggest weakening of both domestic and external demand conditions. The Business Expectations Index of the Reserve Bank¡¯s industrial outlook survey shows muted expansion in demand conditions in Q2, although a decline in input costs augurs well for growth. The impact of monetary policy easing since February 2019 is also expected to support economic activity, going forward. Moreover, base effects will turn favourable in H2:2019-20. Taking into consideration the above factors, real GDP growth for 2019-20 is revised downwards from 7.0 per cent in the June policy to 6.9 per cent _ in the range of 5.8-6.6 per cent for H1:2019-20 and 7.3-7.5 per cent for H2 _ with risks somewhat tilted to the downside; GDP growth for Q1:2020-21 is projected at 7.4 per cent (Chart 2).The MPC notes that inflation is currently projected to remain within the target over a 12-month ahead horizon. Since the last policy, domestic economic activity continues to be weak, with the global slowdown and escalating trade tensions posing downside risks. Private consumption, the mainstay of aggregate demand, and investment activity remain sluggish. Even as past rate cuts are being gradually transmitted to the real economy, the benign inflation outlook provides headroom for policy action to close the negative output gap. Addressing growth concerns by boosting aggregate demand, especially private investment, assumes the highest priority at this juncture while remaining consistent with the inflation mandate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"In order to mitigate risks of excessive leverage, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) designed the Basel III Leverage Ratio (LR) as a simple, transparent, and non-risk-based measure to supplement existing risk-based capital adequacy requirements. In terms of the framework on LR put in place by the Reserve Bank, banks have been monitored against an indicative LR of 4.5%. These guidelines have served the purpose of disclosures and also as the basis for parallel run by banks. The final minimum LR requirement was to be stipulated taking into consideration the final rules prescribed by the Basel Committee by end 2017.BCBS has since finalized that banks must meet a minimum 3% LR requirement at all times (Basel III: Finalising post-crisis reforms, December 2017). Both the capital measure and the exposure measure are to be calculated on a quarter-end basis. However, banks may, subject to supervisory approval, use more frequent calculations (e.g., daily or monthly average) as long as they do so consistently.Keeping in mind financial stability and with a view to moving further towards harmonisation with Basel III standards, it has been decided that the minimum LR should be 4% for Domestic Systemically Important Banks (DSIBs) and 3.5% for other banks. The instructions in this regard shall be issued before end of June 2019.It was notified in the Guidelines for Licensing of ¡°Payments Banks¡± and ¡°Small Finance Banks¡± in the Private Sector dated November 27, 2014, that after gaining experience in dealing with these banks, the Reserve Bank will consider ¡®on tap¡¯ licensing of these banks.In the case of Small Finance Banks, license was issued to ten such banks. Further, eight of the ten Small Finance Banks have also been included in the second schedule of the RBI Act, 1934. A review of the performance of Small Finance Banks reveals that they have achieved their priority sector targets and thus attained their mandate for furthering financial inclusion. Hence, there is a case for more players to be included to enhance access to banking facilities to the small borrowers and to encourage competition. It is, therefore, proposed to issue the Draft Guidelines for ¡®on tap¡¯ Licensing of Small Finance Banks by the end of August 2019.It has also been decided that more time is needed to review the performance of Payments Banks before considering the licensing of this category of banks to be put ¡®on tap¡¯.In August 2010, the Reserve Bank introduced a separate framework for the regulation of systemically important Core Investment Companies (CICs) recognising the difference in the business model of a holding company relative to other non-banking financial companies. Over the years, corporate group structures have become more complex involving multiple layering and leveraging, which has led to greater inter-connectedness to the financial system through their access to public funds. Further, in light of recent developments, there is a need to strengthen the corporate governance framework of CICs.

The Group is expected to submit its report by mid-July 2019.With a view to creating market infrastructure that would ensure fair and transparent pricing for users of foreign exchange (such as Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) exporters and importers, individuals, etc.), the Reserve Bank in October 2017, had issued a discussion paper proposing to set up a foreign exchange trading platform for retail participants that would provide customers with access to an electronic trading platform through an internet-based application on which they can purchase/sell foreign currency at market clearing prices. By unifying the existing fragmented market microstructure, this platform would provide transparency of pricing and promote competition among market-makers leading to better pricing for all customers, regardless of order size. The trading platform has now been developed by the Clearing Corporation of India (CCIL) and is being tested by users. The platform will be available to users for transactions from early August 2019.A well-functioning money market is a crucial link in the chain of monetary policy transmission, apart from being a basic necessity for pricing and liquidity in other financial markets. The Reserve Bank has issued regulations over time covering different money market products _ call money, repo, commercial paper, certificates of deposit and other debt instruments with original maturity less than one year, etc. With the objective of bringing consistency across products in terms of issuers, investors and other participants, it is proposed to rationalize existing regulations covering different money market products. These directions would improve transparency and safety of money markets.It has been the endeavour of RBI to increase retail participation in the government security market.

Well-functioning securitisation markets can enable better management of credit and liquidity risks on the balance-sheets of banks as well as non-bank mortgage originators and, in turn, help lower the costs of mortgage finance in the economy. In India, in contrast, the securitisation market is dominated by direct assignment and purchase of loan receivables of non-banks (including Housing Finance Companies) by banks.In view of the benefits brought in by the standardisation of asset securitisation practices as also their role in enabling superior management of credit and liquidity risks as alluded to before, the Reserve Bank has decided to constitute a Committee that will assess the state of housing finance securitisation markets in India; study the best international practices as well as lessons learnt from the global financial crisis; and propose measures to further develop these markets in India by identifying critical steps required such as, inter alia, definition of conforming mortgages, mortgage documentation standards, digital registry for ease of due diligence and verification by investors, avenues for trading in securitised assets, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Operational details in this regard will be worked out with ICSDs in consultation with the Government and the Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI).As per the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999, forex transactions are required to be made only through the authorised persons who can undertake transactions, specifically permitted to them.With a view to improve the ease of undertaking forex transactions by increasing the last-mile touch points of regulated entities to sell foreign exchange for non-trade current account transactions, it has been decided that non-deposit taking systemically important Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs-NDSI) in the category of Investment & Credit Companies (ICCs) will be made eligible to apply for grant of Authorised Dealer Category II licence. Detailed instructions in this regard shall be issued by the end of April 2019.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Efficient payment systems reduce the cost of exchanging goods and services and are indispensable to the functioning of financial markets. The past decade has witnessed several innovations in retail payments across the globe. Benchmarking India¡¯s Payments Systems is necessary to gauge India¡¯s progress against payment systems and instruments in major countries and give further impetus to the planned efforts for deepening the digitisation of payments. A report containing the findings of such an exercise will be placed on the RBI website by the end of May 2019.The Reserve Bank has directed various authorised payment systems to put in place appropriate customer grievance redressal mechanism. Further, for some payment systems the Reserve Bank has issued guidelines prescribing compensation to be paid to customers for delay in resolving failed transactions. It is, however, observed that the time taken for resolving customer complaint varies across payment systems. In order to have prompt and efficient customer service in all the electronic payment systems, it is necessary to harmonise the Turn Around Time (TAT) of resolution of customer complaints and chargebacks, and to have a compensation framework in place for the benefit of customers. The Reserve Bank proposes to put in place a framework on TAT for resolution of customer complaints and compensation framework across all authorised payment systems by the end of June 2019.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

other,,"Since the last MPC meeting in December 2018, there has been a slowdown in global economic activity. Among key advanced economies (AEs), economic activity in the US lost some steam in Q4:2018. The outlook for Q1:2019 is clouded by the partial government shutdown, though the labour market conditions remain strong. In the Euro area, economic activity lost momentum on weak industrial activity. The Japanese economy is gradually recovering and an accommodative monetary policy stance is expected to buttress domestic spending.Economic activity also slowed in some major emerging market economies (EMEs). In China, growth decelerated in Q4:2018. Economic activity in Russia lost pace, with soft oil prices posing a downside risk to growth. The Brazilian economy appeared to have ended 2018 on a firmer note, driven by improved domestic spending and exports, though industrial activity continued to struggle to recover from the disruptions of H1:2018. In South Africa, the economic recovery in Q4:2018 remained gradual, tempered by weak industrial activity and subdued exports.Crude oil prices recovered from their December lows in early January on production cuts, but remain below their peak levels in October. Base metals, which witnessed selling pressures in December on persisting uncertainty over US-China trade frictions, recouped losses in January on expectations of thawing of trade disputes and production disruptions. Gold prices have risen, underpinned by safe haven demand in response to geo-political uncertainty and volatility in equity markets. Inflation edged lower in major AEs and many key EMEs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Global financial markets began the year on a calmer note after a turbulent December. Among AEs, equity markets in the US recovered from a sharp sell-off in December, triggered by monetary policy tightening by the Fed, trade tensions and an impending shutdown. EM stock markets, which declined in December on a slew of soft economic data, registered some gains recently on expectations of accommodative monetary policy stances in major economies. The 10-year yield in the US, which fell to a multi-month low in December, rose in January on the edging up of crude oil prices and positive risk sentiment, though softening of the Fed stance restricted the gains. Among other AEs, bond yields in the Euro area and Japan eased on diminishing optimism about global growth. In most EMEs, bond yields have eased as well. In currency markets, the US dollar remained under pressure, though expectations of easing trade tensions provided some support. EME currencies appreciated on the pause in the rate hiking cycle by the Fed and expectations of a positive outcome from US-China trade negotiations.Moving on to the domestic economy, on January 7, 2019 the Central Statistics Office (CSO) released the first advance estimates (FAE) for 2018-19, placing India¡¯s real gross domestic product (GDP) growth at 7.2 per cent _ the same level as in 2017-18 (first revised estimates). The FAE for 2018-19 featured an acceleration in gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) and a slowdown in consumption expenditure (both private and government). The drag from net exports is estimated to decline in 2018-19.Some indicators of investment demand, viz., production and imports of capital goods, contracted in November/December. Credit flows to industry remain muted. Available data suggest that while revenue expenditure of the Centre, excluding interest payments and subsidies, contracted in Q3, that of States increased sharply, thus maintaining overall growth in government spending.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"On the supply side, the FAE have placed the growth of real gross value added (GVA) at 7.0 per cent in 2018-19 as compared with 6.9 per cent in 2017-18. The estimates incorporated a slowdown in agricultural GVA growth and an acceleration in industrial GVA growth. Services GVA growth is set to soften due to subdued activity in trade, hotels, transport, communication and other services. Growth in public administration and defence services is also likely to moderate.Rabi sowing so far (up to February 1, 2019) has been lower than in the previous year, but the overall shortfall of 4.0 per cent across various crops is expected to catch up as the season comes to a close. The lower rabi sowing reflects a deficient north-east monsoon (44 per cent below the long period average); however, storage in major reservoirs _ the main source of irrigation during the rabi season _ at 44 per cent of the full reservoir level (as on January 31, 2019) was marginally higher than in the previous year. The extended period of cold weather in this year¡¯s winter is likely to boost wheat yields, which would partly offset the shortfall, if any, in area sown.After exhibiting an uptick in the festive month of October, industrial activity, measured by the index of industrial production (IIP), slowed down in November. The year-on-year (y-o-y) growth in core industries decelerated to 2.6 per cent (y-o-y) in December, pulled down by a slowdown in the production of electricity and coal; and contraction in petroleum refinery products, crude oil and fertilisers output. Capacity utilisation (CU) in the manufacturing sector, as measured by the Reserve Bank¡¯s order books, inventory and capacity utilisation survey (OBICUS), increased to 74.8 per cent in Q2 from 73.8 per cent in Q1; seasonally adjusted CU also improved to 75.3 per cent from 74.9 per cent. While the Reserve Bank¡¯s business assessment index of the industrial outlook survey (IOS) for Q3:2018-19 suggests a weakening of demand conditions in the manufacturing sector, the business expectations index (BEI) points to an improvement in Q4. The manufacturing purchasing managers¡¯ index (PMI) for January remained in expansion on the back of increased output and new orders.High-frequency indicators of the services sector suggest some moderation in the pace of activity. Sales of motorcycles and tractors imply weakening of rural demand in December. Sales of passenger cars _ an indicator of urban demand _ contracted, possibly reflecting volatility in fuel prices and mandated long-term insurance premium payments. Commercial vehicle sales also shrank in December 2018 from a high base of the previous year. Lead indicators for the hotels sub-segment, viz., foreign tourist arrivals and air passenger traffic, point to softening in November-December. In the communication sub-segment, the telephone subscriber base contracted in October-November, while that of broadband continued to expand in October. The services PMI continued to expand in January 2019 despite a dip from the previous month. Indicators of the construction sector, viz., consumption of steel and production of cement, continued to show healthy growth, though growth in cement production inched lower in November 2018, reflecting a base effect.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Retail inflation, measured by y-o-y change in the CPI, declined from 3.4 per cent in October 2018 to 2.2 per cent in December, the lowest print in the last eighteen months. Continuing deflation in food items, a sharp fall in fuel inflation and some edging down of inflation excluding food and fuel contributed to the decline in headline inflation.Five constituents of the food group _ vegetables, sugar, pulses, eggs and fruits, accounting for about 30 per cent of food group _ were in deflation in December. Inflation in respect of other major food sub-groups _ cereals, milk, and oils and fats _ was subdued. Within cereals, rice prices declined for the fourth consecutive month in December. Inflation in prices of meat and fish and non-alcoholic beverages showed an uptick, while it remained sticky for prepared meals.Inflation in the fuel and light group fell from 8.5 per cent in October to 4.5 per cent in December, pulled down by a sharp decline in the prices of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), reflecting softening of international petroleum product prices. Kerosene inflation continued to edge up due to the calibrated increase in its administered price.CPI inflation excluding food and fuel decelerated to 5.6 per cent in December from 6.2 per cent in October, dragged down mainly by the moderation in the prices of petrol and diesel in line with the decline in international petroleum product prices. Housing inflation continued to edge down as the impact of the house rent allowance (HRA) increase for central government employees dissipated. However, inflation in several of the sub-groups _ household goods and services; health; recreation and amusement; and education _ firmed up in December, offsetting much of the impact of lower inflation in petrol, diesel and housing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Inflation expectations of households, measured by the December 2018 round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s survey, softened by 80 basis points for the three-month ahead horizon and by 130 basis points for the twelve-month ahead horizon over the last round, reflecting the continued decline in food and fuel prices. Producers¡¯ assessment of inflation in input prices eased in Q3 as reported by manufacturing firms polled by the Reserve Bank¡¯s industrial outlook survey.Inflation in the prices of farm inputs and industrial raw materials remained elevated, despite some softening. Growth in rural wages moderated in October.The weighted average call rate (WACR) traded below the policy repo rate on 12 out of 20 days in December, all 23 days in January and 4 days in February (up to February 6). The WACR was below the repo rate on an average by 4 basis points in December and 11 basis points each in January and February. Currency in circulation expanded sharply during December and January. The liquidity needs arising out of expansion in currency were met by the Reserve Bank through injection of durable liquidity amounting to _500 billion each in December and January through purchases under open market operations (OMOs). Accordingly, total durable liquidity injected through OMOs has aggregated _2.36 trillion during 2018-19 so far. Liquidity injected under the LAF was _996 billion in December on an average daily net basis, and _329 billion in January. In February, however, the average daily liquidity position turned into surplus with an average absorption of _279 billion.Export growth on a y-o-y basis was almost flat in November and December 2018, primarily due to a high base effect and weak global demand. While growth in exports of petroleum products remained positive, non-oil exports declined, dragged down by lower shipments of gems and jewellery, engineering goods, meat and poultry. Import growth slowed in November and turned negative in December 2018. While imports of petroleum (crude and products) rose in line with the increase in import volumes, non-oil imports such as pearls and precious stones, gold, electronic goods and transport equipment, recorded declines. The merchandise trade deficit for April-December 2018 was a shade higher than its level a year ago. Net services exports picked up in October and November 2018, which combined with low oil prices, could have a salutary impact on the current account deficit in Q3. On the financing side, net FDI flows to India during April-November 2018 were higher than a year ago. Foreign portfolio flows turned negative in January 2019, after rebounding in November and December 2018. India¡¯s foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 400.2 billion on February 1, 2019.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"In the fifth bi-monthly monetary policy resolution in December 2018, CPI inflation for 2018-19 was projected in the range of 2.7-3.2 per cent in H2:2018-19 and 3.8-4.2 per cent in H1:2019-20, with risks tilted to the upside. The actual inflation outcome at 2.6 per cent in Q3:2018-19 was marginally lower than the projection. There have been downward revisions in inflation projections during the course of the year, reflecting mainly the unprecedented soft inflation recorded across food sub-groups.Several factors will shape the inflation path, going forward. First, food inflation has continued to surprise on the downside with continuing deflation across several items and a significant moderation in inflation in cereals. Several food groups are experiencing excess supply conditions domestically as well as internationally. Hence, the short-term outlook for food inflation appears particularly benign, despite adverse base effects. Secondly, the moderation in the fuel group was larger than anticipated. Inflation in items of rural consumption such as firewood and chips, which had remained sticky and at elevated levels, has collapsed in recent months. Electricity prices also showed an unexpected moderation, providing a softer outlook for the fuel group. Thirdly, while inflation excluding food and fuel remains elevated, the recent unusual pick-up in the prices of health and education could be a one-off phenomenon. Fourthly, the crude oil price outlook remains broadly the same as in the December policy. Fifthly, the Reserve Bank¡¯s surveys show that inflation expectations of households as well as input and output price expectations of producers have moderated significantly. Finally, the effect of the HRA increase for central government employees has dissipated completely along expected lines. Taking into consideration these developments and assuming a normal monsoon in 2019, the path of CPI inflation is revised downwards to 2.8 per cent in Q4:2018-19, 3.2-3.4 per cent in H1:2019-20 and 3.9 per cent in Q3:2019-20, with risks broadly balanced around the central trajectory.Turning to the growth outlook, GDP growth for 2018-19 in the December policy was projected at 7.4 per cent (7.2-7.3 per cent in H2) and at 7.5 per cent for H1:2019-20, with risks somewhat to the downside. The CSO has estimated GDP growth at 7.2 per cent for 2018-19. Looking beyond the current year, the growth outlook is likely to be influenced by the following factors. First, aggregate bank credit and overall financial flows to the commercial sector continue to be strong, but are yet to be broad-based. Secondly, in spite of soft crude oil prices and the lagged impact of the recent depreciation of the Indian rupee on net exports, slowing global demand could pose headwinds. In particular, trade tensions and associated uncertainties appear to be moderating global growth. Taking into consideration the above factors, GDP growth for 2019-20 is projected at 7.4 per cent _ in the range of 7.2-7.4 per cent in H1, and 7.5 per cent in Q3 _ with risks evenly balanced.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Headline inflation is projected to remain soft in the near term reflecting the current low level of inflation and the benign food inflation outlook. Beyond the near term, some uncertainties warrant careful monitoring. First, vegetable prices have been volatile in the recent period; reversal in vegetable prices could impart upside risk to the food inflation trajectory. Secondly, the oil price outlook continues to be hazy. Thirdly, a further heightening of trade tensions and geo-political uncertainties could also weigh on global growth prospects, dampening global demand and softening global commodity prices, especially oil prices. Fourthly, the unusual spike in the prices of health and education needs to be closely watched. Fifthly, financial markets remain volatile. Sixthly, the monsoon outcome is assumed to be normal; any spatial or temporal variation in rainfall may alter the food inflation outlook. Finally, several proposals in the union budget for 2019-20 are likely to boost aggregate demand by raising disposable incomes, but the full effect of some of the measures is likely to materialise over a period of time.The MPC notes that the output gap has opened up modestly as actual output has inched lower than potential. Investment activity is recovering but supported mainly by public spending on infrastructure. The need is to strengthen private investment activity and buttress private consumption.Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to change the stance of monetary policy from calibrated tightening to neutral and to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 basis points.The decision to change the monetary policy stance was unanimous. As regards the reduction in the policy repo rate, Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, Dr. Pami Dua, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted in favour of the decision. Dr. Chetan Ghate and Dr. Viral V. Acharya voted to keep the policy rate unchanged. The MPC reiterates its commitment to achieving the medium-term target for headline inflation of 4 per cent on a durable basis.

In view of the above, it is proposed to relax the end-use restrictions under the approval route of the ECB framework for resolution applicants under the CIRP and allow them to utilise the ECB proceeds for repayment of Rupee term loans of the target company. Such ECBs could be availed from all eligible lenders under the extant ECB framework except from overseas branches/subsidiaries of Indian banks. Guidelines in this regard will be issued by the end of February 2019.The structure, size, lack of avenues for raising capital funds and limited area of operation of the Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks (UCBs) add to their financial vulnerabilities. A long-term solution to make the UCB sector financially resilient and to enhance the depositors¡¯ confidence is to set up an Umbrella Organization (UO) as prevalent in many countries. The UO, apart from extending liquidity and capital support to its member UCBs, would also be expected to set up Information and Technology (IT) infrastructure for shared use of members to enable them to widen their range of services in the wake of advances in information and communication technology at a relatively lower cost. The UO can also offer fund management and other consultancy services.The idea of setting up of UO for the UCB sector was first mooted in the year 2006 by the Working Group (Chairman: Shri N S Vishwanathan) set up by the Reserve Bank on Augmentation of Capital of UCBs. It was examined in greater detail by the Working Group on Umbrella Organization and Constitution of Revival Fund for Urban Cooperative Banks (Chairman: Shri V S Das) in 2009 and the Expert Committee on Licensing of New Urban Co-operative Banks (Chairman: Shri Y H Malegam) in the year 2011. The need for UO has also been stressed by the High Powered Committee on UCBs (Chairman: Shri R Gandhi) in the year 2015.The Reserve Bank has received a proposal for setting up an UO from the National Federation of Urban Cooperative Banks and Credit Societies Ltd. (NAFCUB). A decision on the specifics of the UO proposal will be taken by the Reserve Bank shortly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With a view to facilitating flow of credit to well-rated NBFCs, it has now been decided that rated exposures of banks to all NBFCs, excluding Core Investment Companies (CICs), would be risk-weighted as per the ratings assigned by the accredited rating agencies, in a manner similar to that for corporates. Exposures to CICs will continue to be risk-weighted at 100%. Guidelines in this regard will be issued by the end of February 2019.Various categories of NBFCs have evolved over time pertaining to specific sector/asset classes. Regulations put in place for each NBFC category have also been somewhat different. At present, there are twelve such categories. The Committee on Comprehensive Financial Services for Small Businesses and Low Income Households (chaired by Dr. Nachiket Mor) and Internal Committee (Chairman: Shri G. Padmanabhan), which submitted their reports in January 2014 and April 2014 respectively, had recommended harmonisation of the various categories of NBFCs. The Reserve Bank is committed to such harmonisation and to move towards activity-based regulation replacing the current entity-based regulation for the NBFC sector. As a first step in this direction, deposit acceptance regulations were harmonised in November 2014. Further, with the recent rationalization and liberalization of ECB norms, differential rules applicable to various categories of NBFCs stand harmonised.It has now been decided to harmonise major categories of NBFCs engaged in credit intermediation, viz., Asset Finance Companies (AFC), Loan Companies, and Investment Companies, into a single category. The proposed merger of existing categories would reduce to a large extent the complexities arising from multiple categories and also provide the NBFCs greater flexibility in their operations. It will cover 99% of the NBFCs by number. Guidelines in this regard will be issued by the end of February 2019.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the same time, there is a need to improve residents¡¯ access to derivatives markets to hedge their currency risks. In order to take forward the process of gradual opening up of the foreign exchange market and also to benefit from a wider range of participants and views, it is proposed to set up a Task Force on Offshore Rupee Markets.

other,,"The Reserve Bank has, over time, issued regulations covering various interest rate derivative products such as Interest Rate Swap (IRS), Forward Rate Agreement (FRA), Interest Rate Future (IRF), Interest Rate Option (IRO) and Money Market Future (MMF). The comprehensive guidelines on derivatives was issued in 2007 to clearly define the roles and responsibilities for users and market makers. However, except Overnight Indexed Swaps (OIS), the activity in these derivative markets has been rather thin and limited. This, among other reasons, has contributed to a limited use of interest rate derivatives in the Indian financial sector. Some of these regulations have also not been reviewed for almost two decades (IRS/FRA guideline of 1999). It is, therefore, proposed to rationalise interest rate derivative regulations to achieve consistency and ease of access with the eventual objective of fostering a thriving environment for management of interest rate risk in the Indian economy. The draft comprehensive guidelines will be issued for public feedback by the end of March 2019.It was proposed in the Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies, in the Fourth Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement dated October 05, 2018, to introduce a regulatory framework for financial benchmarks to improve the governance of the benchmark processes relating to financial products and markets regulated by the Reserve Bank.

FPIs were given exemption from this requirement on their new investments till end-March 2019 to adjust their portfolios. While the provision was aimed at incentivizing FPIs to maintain a portfolio of assets, further market feedback indicates that FPIs have been constrained by this stipulation.

other,,"Since the last MPC meeting in October 2018, global economic activity has shown increasing signs of weakness on rising trade tensions. Among advanced economies (AEs), economic activity appears to be slowing in the US in Q4:2018, after a buoyant Q3. The Euro area growth lost pace in Q3, impacted by weaker trade growth and new vehicle emission standards. The Japanese economy contracted in Q3 on subdued external and domestic demand.Economic activity also decelerated in major emerging market economies (EMEs) in Q3. In China, growth slowed down on weak domestic demand. The ongoing trade tensions and the possible cooling of the housing market pose major risks to growth in China. The Russian economy lost some traction, pulled down largely by a weak agriculture harvest, though the growth was buttressed by strong performance of the energy sector. The Brazilian economy seems to be recovering gradually from the economic disruption in the first half of the year. The South African economy expanded in Q3, after contracting in the previous two quarters, driven by agriculture and manufacturing.Crude oil prices have declined sharply, reflecting higher supplies and easing of geo-political tensions. Base metal prices have continued to decline on selling pressure following weak demand from major economies. Gold price has risen underpinned by safe haven demand triggered by political uncertainty in some geographies, though a strong dollar may stem the rise. The inflation scenario has remained broadly unchanged in the US and the Euro area. In many key EMEs, however, inflation has risen, though the recent retreat in energy prices, tightening of policy stances by central banks and stabilising of currencies may have a salutary impact, going forward.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Global financial markets have been driven mainly by rising policy rates in the US, volatile crude oil prices and expectations of a slowdown compared with earlier projections. Among AEs, equity markets in the US witnessed a selloff on the weakening outlook for corporate earnings caused by rising borrowing costs, while the European stock markets declined on political uncertainties. The Japanese stock market also shed gains on global cues and the gradual strengthening of the yen. EM stock markets have corrected on shrinking global liquidity, weak economic data in some key EMEs, and lingering trade tensions. The 10-year yield in the US, which surged on robust economic data at the beginning of October, softened subsequently on the unchanged Fed stance. Among other AEs, bond yields in the Euro area and Japan softened on weak economic sentiment and idiosyncratic factors. In most EMEs, bond yields have softened in recent weeks on falling crude oil prices and steadying currencies. In currency markets, the US dollar, which was strengthening on a widening growth differential with its peers, eased in the second half of November. The euro has weakened on Brexit and budget concerns in Italy, while the yen appreciated on safe haven buying in November. EME currencies have been trading with an appreciating bias, supported by a sharp decline in crude oil prices and conservative domestic monetary policy stances.On the domestic front, gross domestic product (GDP) growth slowed down to 7.1 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) in Q2:2018-19, after four consecutive quarters of acceleration, weighed down by moderation in private consumption and a large drag from net exports. Private consumption slowed down possibly on account of moderation in rural demand, subdued growth in kharif output, depressed prices of agricultural commodities and sluggish growth in rural wages. However, growth in government final consumption expenditure (GFCE) strengthened, buoyed by higher spending by the central government. Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) expanded by double-digits for the third consecutive quarter, driven mainly by the public sector¡¯s thrust on national highways and rural infrastructure, which was also reflected in robust growth in cement production and steel consumption. Growth of imports accelerated at a much faster pace than that of exports, resulting in net exports pulling down aggregate demand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"On the supply side, growth of gross value added (GVA) at basic prices decelerated to 6.9 per cent in Q2, reflecting moderation in agricultural and industrial activities. Slowdown in agricultural GVA was largely the outcome of tepid growth in kharif production. Within industry, growth in manufacturing decelerated due to lower profitability of manufacturing firms, pulled down largely by a rise in input costs, while that in mining and quarrying turned negative, caused by a contraction in output of crude oil and natural gas. Growth in electricity, gas, water supply and other utility services strengthened. Services sector growth remained unchanged at the previous quarter¡¯s level. Of its constituents, growth in construction activity decelerated sequentially, but it was much higher on a y-o-y basis. Growth in public administration and defence services accelerated sharply.Looking beyond Q2, rabi sowing so far (up to end-November) has been 8.3 per cent lower as compared with the same period last year due mainly to lower soil moisture levels resulting from a deficient monsoon and a delayed kharif harvest across states. Precipitation during the north-east monsoon as on November 28 was 49 per cent below the long period average. Storage in major reservoirs, the main source of irrigation during the rabi season, was at 61 per cent of the full reservoir level as on November 29.Growth in the index of industrial production (IIP) slowed down to 4.5 per cent in September 2018. Capacity utilisation (CU), measured by the Reserve Bank¡¯s Order Books, Inventories and Capacity Utilisation Survey (OBICUS), increased from 73.8 per cent in Q1 to 76.1 per cent in Q2, which was higher than the long-term average of 74.9 per cent; seasonally adjusted CU also increased to 76.4 per cent. Available high frequency indicators suggest that industrial activity has been improving in Q3. The growth in core industries recovered in October on the back of double-digit expansion in coal, cement and electricity. The purchasing managers¡¯ index (PMI) for manufacturing touched an eleven-month high of 54.0 in November, supported by an expansion in output, and domestic and export orders. According to the assessment of the Reserve Bank¡¯s Industrial Outlook Survey (IOS), the overall business sentiment in Q3 remained stable, with sustained optimism about production and exports.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"High frequency indicators of service sector activity showed a mixed picture in September-October. Growth in tractors sales _ an indicator of rural demand _ turned negative in September. Growth in two-wheeler sales, another indicator of rural demand, rebounded in October, supported by a base effect. Growth in passenger vehicles sales _ an indicator of urban demand _ turned marginally positive in October, after three consecutive months of negative growth coincident with changes in mandatory long-term third-party insurance requirements and a sharp increase in fuel prices. Commercial vehicle sales growth remained robust in September-October, despite some deceleration. Railway freight traffic improved markedly in October to touch a five-year high growth. While domestic air passenger traffic sustained robust growth, international passenger traffic contracted. PMI for services registered a sharp uptick in November, driven by new business. The composite PMI output index touched a two-year high of 54.5 in November.Retail inflation, measured by y-o-y change in CPI, declined from 3.7 per cent in September to 3.3 per cent in October. A large fall in food prices pushed food group into deflation and more than offset the increase in inflation in items excluding food and fuel. Adjusting for the estimated impact of an increase in house rent allowance (HRA) for central government employees, headline inflation was 3.1 per cent in October.Within the food and beverages group, deflation in vegetables, pulses and sugar deepened in October. Among other items, there was a broad-based softening across food items, especially cereals, milk, fruits and prepared meals. Milk and milk products inflation softened caused by surplus supplies in the domestic market. Fruits inflation moderated, while prepared meals registered a price decline for the first time in the CPI series. Inflation, however, showed an uptick in meat and fish, and non-alcoholic beverages.Inflation in the fuel and light group remained elevated, driven by liquefied petroleum gas prices in October, tracking international petroleum product prices. Kerosene prices also edged up, reflecting the calibrated increase in their administered price. However, electricity prices softened in October. Inflation in rural fuel items such as firewood and chips and dung cake also moderated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"CPI inflation excluding food and fuel accelerated to 6.1 per cent in October; adjusted for the estimated HRA impact, it was 5.9 per cent. Transport and communication registered a marked increase, pulled up by higher petroleum product prices, transportation fares and prices of automobiles. A broad-based increase was also observed in health, household goods and services, and personal care and effects. However, inflation moderated significantly in clothing and footwear, as also housing on waning of the HRA impact of central government employees. Inflation expectations of households, measured by the November 2018 round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s survey, softened by 40 basis points for the three-month ahead horizon over the last round reflecting decline in food and petroleum product prices, while they remained unchanged for the twelve-month ahead horizon. Producers¡¯ assessment for input prices inflation eased marginally in Q3 as reported by manufacturing firms polled by the Reserve Bank¡¯s IOS. Domestic farm and industrial input costs remained high. Rural wage growth remained muted in Q2, while staff cost growth in the manufacturing sector remained elevated.The weighted average call rate (WACR) traded below the policy repo rate on 14 out of 21 days in October, on all 18 days in November and both days in December (December 3 and 4). The WACR traded below the repo rate on an average by 5 basis points in October, 9 basis points in November and 16 basis points in December. There was large currency expansion in October and especially during the festive season in November. Currency in circulation, however, contracted in each of the last three weeks in November. Liquidity needs arising from the growth in currency and the Reserve Bank¡¯s forex operations were met through a mixture of tools based on an assessment of the evolving liquidity conditions. The Reserve Bank injected durable liquidity amounting to _360 billion in October and _500 billion in November through open market purchase operations, bringing total durable liquidity injection to _1.36 trillion for 2018-19. Liquidity injected under the LAF, on an average daily net basis, was _560 billion in October, _806 billion in November and _105 billion in December (up to December 4).India¡¯s merchandise exports rebounded in October 2018, after moderating in the previous month, driven mainly by petroleum products, engineering goods, chemicals, electronics, readymade garments, and gems and jewellery. Imports also grew at a faster pace in October relative to the previous month, contributed mainly by petroleum products and electronic goods. Consequently, the trade deficit widened in October 2018 sequentially as also in comparison with the level a year ago. Provisional data suggest a modest improvement in net exports of services in Q2:2018-19, which augurs well for the current account balance. On the financing side, net FDI flows moderated in April-September 2018. Portfolio flows turned positive in November on account of a sharp decline in oil prices, indications of a less hawkish stance by the US Fed and a softer US dollar. However, during the year, there were net portfolio outflows of US$ 14.8 billion (up to November 30). Non-resident deposits increased markedly in H1:2018-19 on a net basis over their level a year ago. India¡¯s foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 393.7 billion on November 30, 2018.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"In the fourth bi-monthly resolution of October 2018, CPI inflation was projected at 4.0 per cent in Q2:2018-19, 3.9-4.5 per cent in H2 and 4.8 per cent in Q1:2019-20, with risks somewhat to the upside. Excluding the HRA impact, CPI inflation was projected at 3.7 per cent in Q2:2018-19, 3.8-4.5 per cent in H2 and 4.8 per cent in Q1:2019-20. The actual inflation outcome in Q2 at 3.9 per cent was marginally lower than the projection of 4.0 per cent. However, the October inflation print at 3.3 per cent turned out to be unexpectedly low.There have been several important developments since the October policy which will have a bearing on the inflation outlook. First, despite a significant scaling down of inflation projections in the October policy primarily due to moderation in food inflation, subsequent readings have continued to surprise on the downside with the food group slipping into deflation. At a disaggregated level, deflation in pulses, vegetables and sugar widened, while cereals inflation moderated sequentially. The broad-based weakening of food prices imparts downward bias to the headline inflation trajectory, going forward. Secondly, in contrast to the food group, there has been a broad-based increase in inflation in non-food groups. Thirdly, international crude oil prices have declined sharply since the last policy; the price of Indian crude basket collapsed to below US$ 60 a barrel by end-November after touching US$ 85 a barrel in early October. However, selling prices, as reported by firms polled in the Reserve Bank¡¯s latest IOS, are expected to edge up further in Q4 on the back of increased demand. Fourthly, global financial markets have continued to be volatile with EME currencies showing a somewhat appreciating bias in the last one month. Finally, the effect of the 7th Central Pay Commission¡¯s HRA increase has continued to wane along expected lines. Taking all these factors into consideration and assuming a normal monsoon in 2019, inflation is projected at 2.7-3.2 per cent in H2:2018-19 and 3.8-4.2 per cent in H1:2019-20, with risks tilted to the upside (Chart 1). The projected inflation path remains unchanged after adjusting for the HRA impact of central government employees as this impact dissipates completely from December 2018 onwards. Although recent food inflation prints have surprised on the downside and prices of petroleum products have softened considerably, it is important to monitor their evolution closely and allow heightened short-term uncertainties to be resolved by incoming data.Turning to growth projections, although Q2 growth was lower than that projected in the October policy, GDP growth in H1 has been broadly along the line in the April policy when for the year as a whole GDP growth was projected at 7.4 per cent. Going forward, lower rabi sowing may adversely affect agriculture and hence rural demand. Financial market volatility, slowing global demand and rising trade tensions pose negative risk to exports. However, on the positive side, the decline in crude oil prices is expected to boost India¡¯s growth prospects by improving corporate earnings and raising private consumption through higher disposable incomes. Increased capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector also portends well for new capacity additions. There has been significant acceleration in investment activity and high frequency indicators suggest that it is likely to be sustained. Credit offtake from the banking sector has continued to strengthen even as global financial conditions have tightened. FDI flows could also increase with the improving prospects of the external sector. The demand outlook as reported by firms polled in the Reserve Bank¡¯s IOS has improved in Q4. Based on an overall assessment, GDP growth for 2018-19 has been projected at 7.4 per cent (7.2-7.3 per cent in H2) as in the October policy, and for H1:2019-20 at 7.5 per cent, with risks somewhat to the downside (Chart 2).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Even as inflation projections have been revised downwards significantly and some of the risks pointed out in the last resolution have been mitigated, especially of crude oil prices, several uncertainties still cloud the inflation outlook. First, inflation projections incorporate benign food prices based on the realised outcomes of food inflation in recent months. The prices of several food items are at unusually low levels and there is a risk of sudden reversal, especially of volatile perishable items. Secondly, available data suggest that the effect of revision in minimum support prices (MSPs) announced in July on prices has been subdued so far. However, uncertainty continues about the exact impact of MSP on inflation, going forward. Thirdly, the medium-term outlook for crude oil prices is still uncertain due to global demand conditions, geo-political tensions and decision of OPEC which could impinge on supplies. Fourthly, global financial markets continue to be volatile. Fifthly, though households¡¯ near-term inflation expectations have moderated in the latest round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s survey, one-year ahead expectations remain elevated and unchanged. Sixthly, fiscal slippages, if any, at the centre/state levels, will influence the inflation outlook, heighten market volatility and crowd out private investment. Finally, the staggered impact of HRA revision by State Governments may push up headline inflation. While the MPC will look through the statistical impact of HRA revisions, it will be watchful of any second-round effects on inflation.The MPC noted that the benign outlook for headline inflation is driven mainly by the unexpected softening of food inflation and collapse in oil prices in a relatively short period of time. Excluding food items, inflation has remained sticky and elevated, and the output gap remains virtually closed. The MPC also noted that even as escalating trade tensions, tightening of global financial conditions and slowing down of global demand pose some downside risks to the domestic economy, the decline in oil prices in recent weeks, if sustained, will provide tailwinds. The acceleration in investment activity also bodes well for the medium-term growth potential of the economy. The time is apposite to further strengthen domestic macroeconomic fundamentals. In this context, fiscal discipline is critical to create space for and crowd in private investment activity.Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate on hold and maintain the stance of calibrated tightening. While the decision on keeping the policy rate unchanged was unanimous, Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia voted to change the stance to neutral. The MPC reiterates its commitment to achieving the medium-term target for headline inflation of 4 per cent on a durable basis. The minutes of the MPC¡¯s meeting will be published by December 19, 2018.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Since the last MPC meeting in August 2018, global economic activity has remained resilient in spite of ongoing trade tensions, but is becoming uneven and the outlook is clouded by several uncertainties. Among advanced economies (AEs), the United States (US) economy appeared to have sustained pace in Q3:2018 as reflected in strong retail sales and robust industrial activity. In the Euro area, economic activity remained subdued due to overall weak economic sentiment, weighed down mainly by political uncertainty. The Japanese economy has so far maintained the momentum of the previous quarter, buoyed by recovering industrial production and strong business optimism.Economic activity in major emerging market economies (EMEs) has been facing headwinds from both global and country-specific factors. In China, industrial production growth has moderated with slowing exports and the ongoing deleveraging of the financial system weighing on growth prospects. The Russian economy has been gathering steam with the manufacturing sector turning around, and the employment scenario remaining upbeat on rising oil prices. In Brazil, economic activity is recovering from the setback in Q2, supported by improving business and consumer sentiment, though weak domestic demand and the sluggish pace of recovery in manufacturing activity point to a slow revival. The South African economy slipped into recession in Q2:2018, pulled down by the negative contribution from agriculture on account of a strong unfavourable base effect.Growth in global trade is weakening as reflected in export orders and automobile production and sales. Crude oil prices eased during the first half of August on concerns of reduced demand from EMEs due mainly to the spillover from country-specific turmoil, and accentuated by rising supplies. However, prices rebounded on expectation of reduced supplies due to sanctions on Iran and falling US stockpiles. Base metal prices witnessed selling pressure in anticipation of weak demand from major economies. Gold prices continued to slide lower on a strong US dollar, though they recovered somewhat on safe-haven demand from the mid-August lows. Inflation remained firm in the US, reflecting tightening labour market and elevated energy prices, while it persisted much below the central bank¡¯s target in Japan. In the Euro area, inflation pressures have been sustained by elevated crude prices. Inflation in many key EMEs has risen on surging crude prices and currency depreciations, caused by a firm dollar and domestic factors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Global financial markets continued to be affected by monetary policy stances in major AEs, the spreading of contagion risks from specific EMEs, and geopolitical developments. Among AEs, equity markets in the US touched a new high, driven by technology stocks, while in Japan, they were boosted by the weak yen. In contrast, stock markets in the Euro area suffered losses on signs of a slowdown and budget concerns in some member states. Sharp sell-offs have occurred on waning appetite of foreign portfolio investors for EME equities. The 10-year sovereign yield in the US has traded sideways, falling on dovish Fed guidance only to recover by end-September on robust economic data. Among other AEs, bond yields in the Euro area hardened in September on risk aversion following the sharp rise in financial market volatility in August. In contrast, bond yields in Japan moved in a narrow range, driven by the central bank¡¯s yield curve management policy. In most EMEs, yields rose due to domestic factors and/or contagion effects from the stress in other EMEs. In currency markets, the US dollar witnessed selling pressures since August on reduced investor expectations of rate hikes by the US Fed. However, it recovered in the last week of September on a rate hike by the Fed and strong economic data. The euro remained in bearish territory due to fiscal risks in some member countries and expectations of weak growth. EME currencies continued to depreciate against the US dollar.On the domestic front, real gross domestic product (GDP) growth surged to a nine-quarter high of 8.2 per cent in Q1:2018-19, extending the sequential acceleration to four successive quarters. Of the constituents, gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) expanded by double digits for the second consecutive quarter, driven by the government¡¯s focus on the road sector and affordable housing. Growth in private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) accelerated to 8.6 per cent, reflecting rising rural and urban spending, supported by retail credit growth. However, government final consumption expenditure (GFCE) decelerated, largely due to a high base. The growth of exports of goods and services jumped to 12.7 per cent, powered by non-oil exports on the back of strong global demand. In spite of import growth continuing to surge, high exports growth helped reduce the drag from net exports on aggregate demand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"On the supply side, growth of gross value added (GVA) at basic prices accelerated in Q1, underpinned by double-digit expansion in manufacturing activity which was robust and generalised across firm sizes. Agricultural growth also picked up, supported by robust growth in production of rice, pulses and coarse cereals alongside a sustained expansion in livestock products, forestry and fisheries. In contrast, services sector growth moderated somewhat, largely on account of a high base. Construction activity, however, maintained strong pace for the second consecutive quarter.The fourth advance estimates of agricultural production for 2017-18 released in August placed foodgrains production at a high of 284.8 million tonnes, 1.9 per cent higher than the third advance estimates (released in May 2018) and 3.5 per cent higher than the final estimates for the previous year. The progress of the south-west monsoon has been marked by uneven spatial and temporal distribution, with an overall deficit of 9 per cent in precipitation. However, the first advance estimates of production of major kharif crops for 2018-19 have placed foodgrains production at 141.6 million tonnes, 0.6 per cent higher than last year¡¯s level. The live storage in major reservoirs (as on September 27) rose to 76 per cent of the full capacity, which was 17 per cent higher than last year and 5 per cent higher than the average of the last 10 years. This bodes well for the rabi sowing season.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Industrial growth, measured by the index of industrial production (IIP), accelerated in June-July 2018 on a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis, underpinned mainly by high growth in consumer durables, notably two-wheelers, readymade garments, stainless steel utensils, auto components and spares, and accessories. Growth in consumer non-durables also accelerated in July. The infrastructure and construction sector continued to show solid growth. Primary goods growth accelerated, driven by mining, electricity and petroleum refinery products. Growth in capital goods production spiked in June, but decelerated sharply in July. The output of eight core industries growth remained strong in July, driven by coal, petroleum refinery products, steel and cement, but moderated in August. Capacity utilisation (CU) declined from 75.2 per cent in Q4:2017-18 to 73.8 per cent in Q1:2018-19, while seasonally adjusted CU increased by 1.8 percentage points to the long-term average of 74.9 per cent. Based on the Reserve Bank¡¯s business expectations index (BEI), the assessment for Q2:2018-19 improved, led by enhanced production, order books, exports and capacity utilisation. The August and September manufacturing purchasing managers¡¯ index (PMI) remained in expansion zone; the September print rebounded close to the July level confirming robustness of manufacturing activity.High-frequency indicators of services in July and August present a mixed picture. Indicators of rural demand, viz., growth in tractor and two-wheeler sales, slowed down. Passenger vehicle sales, an indicator of urban demand, declined possibly due to rising fuel prices. However, growth in air passenger traffic _ another indicator of urban demand _ remained robust. Transportation sector indicators, viz., commercial vehicle sales and port cargo, expanded at an accelerated pace. Steel consumption and cement production, indicators of construction activity, showed strong growth. The services PMI remained in expansion zone in August and September, though it decelerated from July, with slower expansion in new business and employment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Retail inflation, measured by the y-o-y change in the CPI, fell from 4.9 per cent in June to 3.7 per cent in August, dragged down by a decline in food inflation. Some softening of inflation in items other than food and fuel also contributed to the decline. Adjusting for the estimated impact of an increase in house rent allowance (HRA) for central government employees, headline inflation was at 3.4 per cent.Inflation in the food and beverages group declined sharply in the absence of seasonal uptick in prices of fruits and vegetables. Of the three key vegetables, the prices of tomatoes declined due to strong mandi arrivals, while those of onions and potatoes remained muted. Continued deflation in prices of pulses and sugar accentuated the decline in food inflation. Inflation in other items of food _ cereals, meat and fish, milk, spices and non-alcoholic beverages _ remained benign.Inflation in the fuel and light group continued to rise on the back of a significant increase in liquefied petroleum gas prices, tracking international product prices. Kerosene prices rose as oil marketing companies reduced subsidies in a calibrated manner. While remaining elevated, CPI inflation excluding food and fuel moderated due to softening in inflation in housing; pan, tobacco and intoxicants; personal care; and transportation.While the September round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s survey of households reported a sharp uptick of 50 basis points in three-month ahead inflation expectations over the last round, one-year ahead expectations moderated by 30 basis points. Inflation expectations for both input prices and selling prices of manufacturing firms, polled by the Reserve Bank¡¯s industrial outlook survey, firmed up in Q2:2018-19. The manufacturing and services PMIs also reported an increase in input costs and selling prices in Q2, reflecting a pass-through of higher costs to clients. On the other hand, growth in wages in the rural and organised manufacturing sectors remained contained.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Systemic liquidity alternated between surplus and deficit during August-September 2018, reflecting the combined impact of expansion of currency in circulation, Reserve Bank¡¯s forex operations and movements in government cash balances. From a daily net average surplus of _201 billion during August 1-19, 2018, liquidity moved into deficit during August 20-30. After turning into surplus during August 31-September 10 due to increased government spending, the system again moved into deficit during September 11-29 on the back of an increase in government cash balances and Reserve Bank¡¯s forex interventions. Based on an assessment of the evolving liquidity conditions, the Reserve Bank conducted two open market purchase operations in the second half of September to inject _200 billion of durable liquidity. LAF operations absorbed, on a daily net average basis, _30 billion in August, but injected _406 billion in September. The weighted average call rate (WACR), on an average, traded below the repo rate by 15 basis points (bps) in August and by 4 bps in September. Exports maintained double digit growth in July and August 2018, driven mainly by petroleum products (which benefitted from elevated crude oil prices), engineering goods, gems and jewellery, drugs and pharmaceuticals, and chemicals. However, imports grew faster than exports, reflecting not only a higher oil import bill, but also higher imports of gold, coal, electronic goods and machinery. This led to a widening of the trade deficit to US$ 35.3 billion in July-August 2018 from US$ 24.6 billion a year ago over and above the expansion in Q1:2018-19. However, higher net services receipts and private transfer receipts helped contain the current account deficit to 2.4 per cent of GDP in Q1:2018-19 from 2.5 per cent a year ago. On the financing side, net foreign direct investment (FDI) flows improved in April-July 2018. By contrast, foreign portfolio investors have been net sellers in both the equity and debt segments so far on a cumulative basis in 2018-19 due to higher US interest rates, risk-off sentiment in EMEs and escalation of trade wars. India¡¯s foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 400.5 billion on September 28, 2018.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"In the third bi-monthly resolution of August 2018, CPI inflation was projected at 4.6 per cent in Q2:2018-19, 4.8 per cent in H2 and 5.0 per cent in Q1:2019-20, with risks evenly balanced. Excluding the HRA impact, CPI inflation was projected at 4.4 per cent in Q2:2018-19, 4.7-4.8 per cent in H2 and 5.0 per cent in Q1:2019-20. Actual inflation outcomes, especially in August, were below projections as the expected seasonal increase in food prices did not materialise and inflation excluding food and fuel moderated.Going forward, the inflation outlook is expected to be influenced by several factors. First, food inflation has remained unusually benign, which imparts a downward bias to its trajectory in the second half of the year. Inflation in key food items such as pulses, edible oils, sugar, fruits and vegetables remains exceptionally soft at this juncture. The risk to food inflation from spatially and temporally uneven rainfall is also mitigated, as confirmed by the first advance estimates that have placed production of major kharif crops for 2018-19 higher than last year¡¯s record. An estimate of the impact of an increase in minimum support prices (MSPs) announced in July has been factored in the baseline projections. Secondly, the price of the Indian basket of crude oil has increased sharply, by US$ 13 a barrel, since the last resolution. Thirdly, international financial markets remained volatile with EME currencies depreciating significantly. Finally, the HRA effect came off its peak in June and is dissipating gradually on expected lines. Taking all these factors into consideration, inflation is projected at 4.0 per cent in Q2:2018-19, 3.9-4.5 per cent in H2 and 4.8 per cent in Q1:2019-20, with risks somewhat to the upside (Chart 1). Excluding the HRA impact, CPI inflation is projected at 3.7 per cent in Q2:2018-19, 3.8 - 4.5 per cent in H2 and 4.8 per cent in Q1:2019-20.Turning to the growth outlook, the GDP print of Q1:2018-19 was significantly higher than that projected in the August resolution. Private consumption has remained robust and is likely to be sustained even as the recent rise in oil prices may have a bearing on disposable incomes. Improving capacity utilisation, larger FDI inflows and increased financial resources to the corporate sector augur well for investment activity. However, both global and domestic financial conditions have tightened, which may dampen investment activity. Rising crude oil prices and other input costs may also drag down investment activity by denting profit margins of corporates. This adverse impact will be alleviated to the extent corporates are able to pass on increases in their input costs. Uncertainty surrounds the outlook for exports. Tailwinds from the recent depreciation of the rupee could be muted by the slowing down of global trade and the escalating tariff war. Based on an overall assessment, GDP growth projection for 2018-19 is retained at 7.4 per cent as in the August resolution (7.4 per cent in Q2 and 7.1-7.3 per cent in H2), with risks broadly balanced; the path in the August resolution was 7.5 per cent in Q2:2018-19 and 7.3-7.4 per cent in H2. GDP growth for Q1:2019-20 is now projected marginally lower at 7.4 per cent as against 7.5 per cent in the August resolution, mainly due to the strong base effect (Chart 2).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"While the projections of inflation for 2018-19 and Q1:2019-20 have been revised downwards from the August resolution, its trajectory is projected to rise above the August 2018 print. The outlook is clouded with several uncertainties. First, the government announced in September measures aimed at ensuring remunerative prices to farmers for their produce, although uncertainty continues about their exact impact on food prices. Secondly, oil prices remain vulnerable to further upside pressures, especially if the response of oil-producing nations to supply disruptions from geopolitical tensions is not adequate. The recent excise duty cuts on petrol and diesel will moderate retail inflation. Thirdly, volatility in global financial markets continues to impart uncertainty to the inflation outlook. Fourthly, a sharp rise in input costs, combined with rising pricing power, poses the risk of higher pass-through to retail prices for both goods and services. Firms covered under the Reserve Bank¡¯s industrial outlook survey report firming of input costs in Q2:2018-19 and Q3. However, global commodity prices other than oil have moderated, which should mitigate the adverse influence on input costs. Fifthly, should there be fiscal slippage at the centre and/or state levels, it will have a bearing on the inflation outlook, besides heightening market volatility and crowding out private sector investment. Finally, the staggered impact of HRA revision by the state governments may push up headline inflation. While the MPC will look through the statistical impact of HRA revisions, there is need to be watchful for any second-round effects on inflation. The inflation outlook calls for a close vigil over the next few months, especially because the output gap has virtually closed and several upside risks persist. Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged. The MPC reiterates its commitment to achieving the medium-term target for headline inflation of 4 per cent on a durable basis.
The MPC notes that global headwinds in the form of escalating trade tensions, volatile and rising oil prices, and tightening of global financial conditions pose substantial risks to the growth and inflation outlook. It is, therefore, imperative to further strengthen domestic macroeconomic fundamentals.Regarding the policy repo rate, Dr. Pami Dua, Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Dr. Viral V. Acharya and Dr. Urjit R. Patel voted in favour of keeping the policy repo rate unchanged. Dr. Chetan Ghate voted for an increase in the policy rate by 25 bps.Regarding the stance, Dr. Pami Dua, Dr. Chetan Ghate, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Dr. Viral V. Acharya and Dr. Urjit R. Patel voted in favour of changing the stance to calibrated tightening. Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia voted to keep the neutral stance unchanged. The minutes of the MPC¡¯s meeting will be published by October 19, 2018.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"In the period following the Monetary Policy Report (MPR) of April 2018, several risks it had flagged have been materialising on an ongoing basis. The global macroeconomic and financial environment has been roiled by bouts of financial market volatility, retaliatory trade protectionism among major economies of the world, elevated and volatile crude oil prices, and recurring jitters around the efficacy of managing monetary policy normalisation in the US amidst a late-in-the-cycle US fiscal stimulus, occurring all at once, lashing emerging market economies (EMEs) as an asset class with asset price shocks and capital outflows. More recently, vulnerabilities surfacing amongst specific EMEs have produced powerful contagion effects. Taken together, these global factors appear to be increasing risks around India¡¯s growth prospects over the next 12-month horizon with a slant to the downside. Global growth itself is getting differentiated across economies and the cyclical upswing in global trade that had started in Q4:2017 is being stifled by rising trade tensions.Meanwhile, domestic economic activity has continued to exhibit resilience and stability in these highly unsettled global conditions. On the agricultural front, the spatial distribution of south-west monsoon was somewhat skewed, although most of the kharif crop growing states received normal rainfall. Industrial activity has gathered pace and the outlook for the services sector is gradually improving. Inward foreign direct investment remains buoyant. The slow firming up of private consumption and investment are expected to be sustained in H2:2018-19. The soft headline inflation readings for July and August 2018 relative to projections imply a largely benign food prices outlook in the near term; however, volatility in global financial markets and surging oil prices remain upside risks to inflation over the 12-month ahead horizon. These developments pose challenges for the setting of monetary policy in India.During April-August 2018, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met thrice in accordance with its bi-monthly schedule. Maintaining status quo in its April 2018 meeting, the MPC increased the policy repo rate by 25 basis points (bps) successively in its June and August 2018 meetings. In its June 2018 meeting, the MPC¡¯s vote was unanimous against the backdrop of rising inflation, upward revision in inflation projections, sharper than anticipated increase in crude oil prices, and hardening of households¡¯ inflation expectations.In August, however, the MPC¡¯s vote was by a majority of 5:1. The decision by majority was influenced by further hardening of inflation and inflation expectations amidst uncertainty around the impact of the minimum support price (MSP) hikes. The MPC¡¯s voting pattern, which reflects differences in individual members¡¯ assessments and expectations as well as relative weights on policy goals, is also observed in other central banks (Table I.1).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Looking ahead, it is useful to read into the signals emitted by inflation expectations of firms and households. By shaping price and wage setting behaviour, they influence future inflation. Inflation expectations also adapt to actual inflation outcomes of salient items such as food and fuel. Inflation expectations of urban households surveyed by the Reserve Bank exhibited a mixed picture in its September 2018 round2: they increased by 50 bps over the previous round for the three months ahead horizon and softened by 30 bps for the one year ahead horizon. The proportion of respondents expecting the general price level to increase by more than the current rate, however, declined marginally in the September round for the three months ahead horizon and was almost unchanged for the one year ahead horizon (Chart I.3).Manufacturing firms polled in the July-September 2018 round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s industrial outlook survey expected higher cost of raw materials in Q3:2018-19 (Chart I.4).3 Consequently, respondents anticipated input prices to firm up further and muted profit margins in spite of higher selling prices. According to the Nikkei¡¯s purchasing managers¡¯ survey, firms in both the manufacturing and services sectors raised output prices in September 2018 in the face of input cost pressures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Taking into account the initial conditions, signals from forward-looking surveys and estimates from structural and other models5, CPI inflation is projected to pick up from 3.7 per cent in August 2018 to 3.9 per cent in Q3:2018-19 and 4.5 per cent in Q4:2018-19, with risks somewhat tilted to the upside (Chart I.6). The projected increase in inflation from current levels reflects the waning away of favourable base effects and anticipates the feeding through of the impact of the increase in MSPs into retail inflation. The direct impact of the increase in HRA by central government has started waning and will fade away completely by December 2018. Excluding the estimated impact of HRA for central government employees, CPI inflation is projected at 3.8 per cent in Q3:2018-19 and 4.5 per cent in Q4:2018-19. The 50 per cent and the 70 per cent confidence intervals for headline inflation in Q4:2018-19 are 3.6-5.7 per cent and 3.1-6.4 per cent, respectively.There are upside and downside risks to the baseline inflation path. As stated earlier, the announced increase in MSPs for kharif crops has been much bigger than in the recent past, but there is considerable uncertainty about the exact impact of the scale and timing of government procurement operations. Other upside risks in the context of the baseline projection include supply disruptions in the global crude oil market, volatility in international financial markets and second round effects of the staggered HRA revisions by state governments. A major downside risk to the baseline could be decline in demand for oil due to global growth slowdown on account of rising trade tensions, which may help bring down oil prices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The April 2018 MPR had projected an acceleration in real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2018-19 on the back of: (a) the goods and services tax (GST) stabilising; (b) improving credit offtake; (c) likely boost to investment from primary market resource mobilisation; (d) the process of recapitalisation of public sector banks and resolution of distressed assets under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC); (e) buoyant global trade; and (f) the thrust to the rural and infrastructure sectors in the Union Budget 2018- 19. Most of these have materialised, but to varying extent. However, global trade growth, as stated earlier, seems to be losing its synchronised momentum and this may hinder India¡¯s export prospects. The uneven spatial distribution of the south-west monsoon is another factor that has also imparted some uncertainty to the agricultural outlook and inflation.Taking into account the baseline assumptions, monetary policy tightening of 50 bps during June- August 2018, survey indicators and model forecasts, real GDP growth is projected to improve from 6.7 per cent in 2017-18 to 7.4 per cent in 2018-19 _ 8.2 per cent in Q1, 7.4 per cent in Q2, 7.3 per cent in Q3 and 7.1 per cent in Q4 _ with risks broadly balanced around this baseline path (Chart I.10). For 2019-20, structural model estimates indicate real GDP growth at 7.6 per cent, with quarterly growth rates in the range of 7.4-7.9 per cent, assuming a normal monsoon and no major exogenous or policy shocks. Strengthening investment activity and a further pick-up in credit growth impart an upside bias to the baseline growth projections. However, recent protectionist measures by major economies, threats of currency wars and the uncertainty associated with the pace of monetary policy normalisation in the US and other major advanced economies pose downside risks to the baseline growth path.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Sharp swings in global crude prices over the past six months impart uncertainty to the outlook. The baseline scenario assumes crude oil prices (Indian basket) at US$ 80 per barrel in the second half of 2018-19. Upside risks to the baseline assumption can emanate from geo-political developments and supply disruptions. For a net energy importer like India, the dynamics of international crude price movements have significant macroeconomic implications. Box I.1 presents a scenario in which the Indian basket price increases by 10 per cent to US$ 88 per barrel, which is plausible under the current global crude oil price volatility. Under this scenario, inflation could increase by 20 bps and real GDP growth could be lower by around 15 bps in relation to their respective baselines given in Sections I.2 and I.3 (Charts I.11a and I.12a). Assuming that the Indian basket crude oil price increases by 20 per cent to US$ 96 a barrel, inflation and GDP growth could turn out to be 40 bps above and 30 bps below their respective baselines. Conversely, crude oil prices could soften below the baseline assumption if, for instance, there is a larger than expected shale gas supply and weaker than expected global demand due to growth slowing down on account of protectionist measures. As a result, if the price of the Indian basket of crude falls by 10 per cent to US$ 72 per barrel, inflation could ease by around 20 bps with a boost of 15 bps to growth.In the baseline scenario, global growth is expected to be stronger in 2018 and 2019 relative to 2017. While the pace of global growth has been maintained in Q2:2018, it has turned uneven with new risks clouding the outlook. Escalating protectionism and rising geopolitical tensions could weigh on external demand. Tightening of financial conditions on the back of US monetary policy normalisation and expansionary US fiscal policy and uncertainty about the pace of further normalisation could also dampen global demand. If global growth slips by 50 bps, domestic growth and inflation could be around 20 bps and 10 bps below their respective baseline trajectories. However, if inflation remains benign in major advanced economies, a more gradual pace of monetary policy normalisation in these economies could boost global demand and global commodity prices. In this scenario, assuming that global growth surprises by 25 bps on the upside, domestic growth and inflation could edge higher by around 10 bps and 5 bps, respectively (Charts I.11a and I.12aFollowing the increase in pay and allowances by the central government for its employees based on the recommendations of the 7th central pay commission (CPC), some state governments have revised pay and allowances for their employees. If all state governments implement the increase in pay and allowances _ especially HRAs _ of an order similar to that of the central government, and if these get reflected in CPI, headline inflation could be around 100 bps above the baseline on account of the direct statistical effect on house rents (Chart I.11b). Additional indirect effects could also arise from higher demand and inflation expectations. As noted by the MPC in its recent resolutions, the direct statistical impact of HRA revisions will be looked through for policy purposes, while being watchful for any second-round effects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Crude oil prices (Indian basket) increased from US$ 47 per barrel in June 2017 to US$ 78 in September 2018, an increase of 67 per cent in a span of 15 months. It is estimated that a US$ 10 increase in the price of international crude oil could reduce output in the OECD area by 20 bps after two years and raise inflation by 20 bps in the first year and by another 10 bps in the second year (OECD, 2011). For large net energy importers like India _ 80 per cent of India¡¯s crude oil requirement is met through imports _ recent estimates suggest that real GDP growth could decline from its current trajectory, while inflation could rise significantly above target, rendering the current favourable macroeconomic conditions vulnerable. In addition, it is estimated that for every US$ 1 increase in the price of a barrel of crude, India¡¯s current account deficit could widen by US$ 0.8 billion.Increases in crude oil prices impact economic activity through a variety of channels. Therefore, it is important to examine their effects in a general equilibrium context. The RBI¡¯s workhorse Quarterly Projection Model (QPM) in its Forecasting and Policy Analysis System (FPAS), which draws its analytical underpinnings from new Keynesian foundations7, provides the flexibility to incorporate these various channels. There is the cost push channel that operates through the prices of non-administered fuel products i.e., petrol and diesel, whereby energy costs impact firms¡¯ input costs, including transportation and other intermediate services. In addition, crude price increases are transmitted to the domestic economy through reduction in global demand, adverse price movements in respect of imports and exports, and undue volatility in the exchange rate. These diverse channels produce substitutions between energy and non-energy consumption, a reduction in output and an increase in inflation. The monetary policy response to these outcomes can, in turn, set off a chain of macroeconomic adjustments.The QPM depicts the various channels through which this transmission works (Chart I.1.1). A 10 per cent increase in international crude prices imparts a shock to petroleum product prices. Headline inflation goes up instantaneously by 13 bps, which takes up to a year to wear off. Furthermore, an increase in petroleum prices imparts cost push effects, which contribute about 15 bps to the increase in headline inflation. People react by spending less on non-oil items of consumption, reducing demand. To the extent that firms are not able to pass through the increase in oil prices to product prices, it reduces their profit margins, cash flows and investment. As a result, aggregate demand declines, leading to a negative contribution to inflation in the range of 5-10 bps. The crude oil price increase can also lead to a deterioration in the trade deficit, which can put downward pressure on the rupee, translating into an additional 10 bps increase in inflation. Consequently, monetary policy tightening is required to bring inflation back to target. The monetary policy reaction widens the output gap, compressing demand and thereby inflation. At its peak, the impact of the 10 per cent increase in crude oil price shock is expected to reduce growth by 15 bps and push up headline inflation by around 20 bps.The effect of crude oil prices on domestic inflation and output depends upon not only on the extent of the change in crude oil prices but also on their initial level. This is because retail petroleum product prices contain several elements which are largely fixed _ for example, excise duty and refining costs _ while the base price moves in line with the movements in international crude oil prices and the exchange rate. The value added tax component moves in line with prices charged to dealers (inclusive of excise duty). The higher the level of crude oil prices, the smaller is the proportion of fixed elements and larger is the impact of a given increase in crude oil prices on domestic petrol and diesel inflation, and hence on overall inflation and output (Chart I.1.2). For instance, an increase of 10 per cent in crude oil prices from US$ 30 per barrel to US$ 33 per barrel is estimated to increase inflation by 13 bps, while a similar order of increase from US$ 100 a barrel to US$ 110 a barrel could pull up inflation by around 22 bps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The large increase in MSPs for kharif crops announced by the government in July 2018 can have a direct impact on food inflation and second round effects on headline inflation through relative price adjustments, higher demand on the back of higher rural incomes and increase in inflation expectations. The baseline projections incorporate the likely effect of the increase in MSPs on inflation, assuming normal procurement by the government in line with past trends (Box II.1). However, if procurement operations turn out to be larger than assumed, headline inflation could increase by around 20 bps above the baseline.The baseline projections assume a fiscal stance as announced in the Union and State budgets for 2018-19. Higher MSPs combined with stepped-up food procurement operations and unbudgeted farm loan waivers by states pose upside risks to the fiscal outlook. Should there be fiscal slippage at the centre and/or state levels, it could result in greater market volatility, crowding out of private investment and higher inflation. Quantitative estimates of these risks will, however, be reliant on incoming data right up to the April 2019 MPR.To sum up, real GDP growth is expected to accelerate in 2018-19 vis-¨¤-vis 2017-18, with the pace of growth easing in H2 relative to H1. Stabilisation of the goods and services tax, progress on resolution of distressed assets under the insolvency and bankruptcy code and initiatives towards strengthening of bank balance sheets are supporting economic and investment activity. However, the uncertain global environment poses an important downside risk to the domestic growth outlook.Inflation is expected to pick up from its current levels as the MSPs for kharif crops feed into domestic food inflation and favourable base effects dissipate. Volatile crude oil prices and the volatility in international financial markets pose the primary upside risks to the inflation outlook.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Inflation has eased in Q2:2018-19 on an unusual ebbing in the momentum of food prices, after rising strongly in Q1 on the back of surging prices of non-food items (including the impact of 7th CPC¡¯s HRA increase) across categories. Input costs rose sharply in Q1 and remained firm in Q2, largely due to increase in fuel prices. Wage pressures remained contained in both rural and organised sectors.Over the first half of 2018-19, the course of consumer price index (CPI) inflation has been shaped by diverse pulls. Within major groups, while food inflation remained soft in Q1:2018-19, and declined sharply in July and August 2018, fuel and light inflation rose noticeably, tracking international prices. Inflation in CPI excluding food and fuel also firmed up in Q1:2018-19 and remained elevated through July- August, notwithstanding some softening. The impact of the increase in house rent allowances (HRA) for central government employees on headline inflation has started to ebb from July.1 Adjusting for the HRA impact, headline inflation in August was estimated at 3.4 per cent as against the print of 3.7 per cent and inflation in CPI excluding food and fuel was estimated at 5.4 per cent against the reading of 6.0 percent (Chart II.1).The MPR of April 2018 had projected CPI inflation to increase from 4.6 per cent observed in Q4:2017-18 to 5.1 per cent in Q1:2018-19 and then moderate to 4.7 per cent in Q2. Excluding the estimated impact of HRA, CPI inflation was projected at 4.7 per cent in Q1 and then moderate to 4.4 per cent in Q2. Actual inflation outcomes have tracked these projections directionally; in terms of magnitude, however, inflation undershot projections by a considerable margin _ 28 basis points (bps) in Q1 and 74 bps in Q2 up to August (Chart II.2) _ entirely on account of a surprising persistence in the softening of prices of fruits, particularly in Q2, and lower than usual hardening in prices of vegetables in the summer months. Food inflation fell from 3.7 per cent in Q4:2017-18 to 3.1 per cent in Q1:2018-19. This is a significant development because it occurred on a base which reflected the after effects of demonetisation in depressing prices of fruits and vegetables in Q1 a year ago. Subsequently, food inflation plunged further to 1.3 per cent in July-August as strong favourable base effects coincided with inexplicable weak momentum of food prices. In fact, ebbing food inflation more than offset the impact of higher than projected crude oil prices _ US$ 73.5 per barrel, on an average, during H1:2018-19 vis-¨¤-vis the baseline assumption of US$ 68 per barrel in April 2018.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"As stated earlier, headline inflation dynamics in H1:2018-19 have reflected divergent movements among constituents which are revealed when momentum and base effects are disentangled. In the case of food items, there has been an unusually low momentum in prices of vegetables and an unexpected decline in prices of fruits in H1. In Q2, base effects turned favourable and along with unseasonally low momentum pulled down food inflation to just 1.3 per cent (up to August 2018) well below its quarterly trend level of six years (7.1 per cent). In the case of items excluding food and fuel, momentum in prices remained strong during April-May in Q1. Thereafter, in Q2 so far, momentum effects have been offset by favourable base effects. As a result, the monotonic hardening of headline inflation from 4.3 per cent in March 2018 to 4.9 per cent by June reversed and inflation fell to 3.7 per cent in August (Chart II.3).On an average, the distribution of inflation across CPI groups in 2018 so far had striking similarities with the outcomes in 2017, a period that also saw soft inflation readings coming from moderation in food inflation in the post-demonetisation period. Median inflation rates were in the range of 4.3-4.8 per cent in both the years and inflation exhibited considerable negative skew on account of deflation in pulses and sugar prices (Chart II.4). Diffusion indices of price changes in CPI items suggest that on a seasonally adjusted basis, a broadening swathe of goods and almost all services have experienced price increases since July, implying that soft headline inflation reading is occurring alongside generalised price increases across goods and services (Chart II.5).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"A historical decomposition of inflation shows that large and sequential supply side shocks, emanating essentially from food group, have defined the overall change in headline inflation trajectory since Q3:2016- 17. In H1:2018-19, several factors impacted inflation _ a favourable food supply shock; an adverse oil price shock; and soft rural wage growth in spite of the quickening of agricultural activity and indications of firming up of rural demand (Chart II.6a).The pick-up in services inflation was led by elevated house rentals on the back of increase in HRA for central government employees. Inflation in other items of services _ education, transport and medical _ also firmed up. From July, however, goods inflation _ especially in respect of perishables _ pulled down overall inflation, helped by subdued month-on-month changes and favourable base effects (Chart II.6b).In terms of weighted contributions, the food group contributed 25.2 per cent to overall inflation during April-August 2018 in contrast to 8.9 per cent a year ago. The average contribution of food inflation to overall inflation in the last five years has been 47 per cent. Within food, inflation in cereals, which has a weight of 9.7 per cent in the CPI and 21.1 per cent in the food and beverages group, remained benign at sub- 3 per cent level during H1:2018-19, with production boosted by two consecutive years of record harvests, and stocks being well above buffer norms. The food inflation trajectory was largely shaped by vegetables, fruits, pulses and sugar during H1:2018-19, with its unexpected slump defying the usual seasonal uptick, especially in prices of vegetables during July-August (Charts II.7 and II.8).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Vegetables account for 6 per cent of the CPI and 13.2 per cent of the food and beverages group. A delayed winter easing of price pressures in vegetables commenced from December 2017 and extended well up to April 2018, as mandi arrivals, specifically of onions and tomatoes, surged muting the usual summer upturn (Chart II.9a). Onion inflation declined from a high of 159 per cent in December 2017 to 23 per cent in May 2018, pulled down by bumper mandi arrivals, imports, and implementation of a minimum export price (MEP) that deterred exports, together creating persistent surplus supply conditions. Onion prices, however, picked up in July with the country-wide transporters¡¯ strike, which affected the supplies of essential food items. After remaining low during April-May, prices of tomatoes recorded an upsurge during June-July due to widespread farmers¡¯ agitations. By contrast, price pressures have been more pronounced in respect of potatoes since March 2018 due to lower availability of stocks from cold storages, transport disruptions and protests organised by potato farmers against not receiving remunerative prices for their crops. Prices of vegetables, however, witnessed some easing in August 2018 led by a contraction in prices of tomatoes and moderation in onion price pressures as arrivals surged, which played a key role in moderating food inflation during the month.An analysis of prices of vegetables based on sectoral CPI indices suggests that there is no statistically significant difference in month-on-month changes in prices of vegetables between rural and urban areas.5 A decomposition of the CPI-vegetables into its trend and cyclical components reveals a rising trend since H1:2017-18, indicating that the recent softening in vegetable prices may not be structural in nature (Chart II.9b).
Fruits prices also declined during June-August, contrary to the usual seasonal pattern. Fruits have a weight of 2.9 per cent in the CPI and 6.3 per cent within the food and beverages sub-component. Healthy domestic production of major fruits like mangoes and bananas, together with imports of some fruits (particularly apples and citrus fruits) pulled down fruits prices in contrast to the usual pattern in June and July every year when they rise (Chart II.10).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Deflation in the prices of pulses persisted on the back of over-supply, though the pace of deflation moderated during H1. Pulses account for 2.4 per cent of the CPI and 5.2 per cent of the food and beverages sub-component. Mandi level prices of some pulses such as arhar and urad remained below their minimum support prices (MSPs) in major producing states such as Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka. In response, several measures that had been undertaken by the government in the previous year were extended into 2018-19 such as (i) removal of the export ban on all pulses; and (ii) imposition of import duty of 60 per cent on gram and 30 per cent on masoor to provide some relief to farmers. Nonetheless, pulses prices continued to rule well below their historical trend during H1:2018-19 (Chart II.11).Prices of sugar and confectionery also remained in deflation zone from February 2018 on account of surplus production during the sugarcane season of 2017-18 (Charts II.7 and II.8). Domestic sugar prices have closely tracked global price movements which have also been in deflation due to excess global supply. In view of the sharp decline in sugar prices, the government raised the import duty on sugar to 100 per cent, besides re-imposing stockholding limits on sugar sales and fixing the ex-mill sugar prices to _29 per kg in June 2018. Moreover, the customs duty on export of sugar was withdrawn to encourage the sugar industry. These measures, along with supply disruptions in July following the transporters¡¯ strike, drove up sugar prices during June-August, though y-o-y inflation continued to be in the negative zone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"In the case of protein-rich items such as eggs, price pressures were visible during June-July 2018, reflecting the combined impact of the usual lower egg production during summer months and higher consumption during early monsoon months in several parts of the country. Furthermore, the country-wide truckers¡¯ strike in July also affected the supply of eggs in several states, adding to upside pressures on prices. However, prices of eggs softened in August. Among other protein-rich items, meat and fish prices experienced the usual upside pressures during May-June, followed by easing during July-August. In the case of milk and products, price pressures were subdued due to robust growth in milk production.Among other food components, edible oil inflation recorded a pick-up in August 2018 after remaining in the range of one to three per cent since May 2017.After an increase in import duties on all major varieties of oils in November 2017, duties were hiked further during March and June 2018 in order to curb cheap imports. Inflation in spices started rising beginning April 2018 after remaining in deflation for 10 successive months since June 2017. While pressures on black pepper prices have remained muted so far, prices of other spices like dry chillies, turmeric, jeera, dhania and tamarind have firmed up, thereby driving up overall inflation in this group (Charts II.7 and II.8). On July 4, 2018 the central government announced minimum support prices (MSPs) for all kharif crops of a minimum of 150 per cent of the cost of production. Increases in MSPs generally get transmitted to headline inflation through direct and second round effects and, it is in the context of the upside risks to the near-term inflation outlook that the size and span of the impact of the MSP need to be carefully evaluated (Box II.1).Fuel and light inflation increased sequentially every month from a trough of 5.2 per cent in April 2018 to 7.2 per cent by June 2018 and further to 8.5 per cent by August 2018 (Chart II.12a). Domestic prices of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) tracked rising international product prices. Since the migration of subsidy payments on LPG to bank accounts under the direct benefit transfer scheme, LPG prices in CPI mirror open market prices. As such, they now reflect international prices closely (Chart II.12b). Inflation in respect of items of rural consumption such as firewood and chips continued to be sticky and elevated. Administered kerosene prices also registered sustained increases as oil marketing companies (OMCs) raised prices regularly in a calibrated manner.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Estimates of the impact of the July 2018 MSP announcements on CPI inflation that are available in the public domain range from 20 bps to 110 bps. For operational purposes, however, precision in these estimates is the key since it conditions the monetary policy response to the likely deviations of inflation from its target. Illustratively, a straight-line approach of imputing the full increase in MSPs on to headline CPI inflation by using CPI weights for the crops in consideration, but without factoring in the scale of procurement operations, may overestimate the MSP impact.The total impact of MSPs on inflation comprises a first round (direct) effect and subsequent second (indirect) round effects. The first round effect _ the quantum by which individual commodities respond to MSP shock _ is estimated econometrically. The second-round effects are estimated using a two-stage process: (1) A static approach that mimics time-invariant economy-wide effects, is first employed to estimate the commodity level producer price effect through a series of iterations using input-output (IO) tables for 2012-13 and mapping those effects to the wholesale price index (WPI) using WPI weights; (2) The pass-through of the wholesale price increases to CPI food inflation components is then worked out by using elasticities derived from an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model.The second-round effects are also examined using RBI¡¯s quarterly projection model, which is a new Keynesian open economy gap model. It attempts to capture several inter-twined effects dynamically. A hike in MSP could trigger relative price adjustments between MSP and non-MSP food items. Higher MSPs could also lead to a rise in rural incomes which would boost food demand. Furthermore, higher labour demand could lead to overall wage increases in the rural sector as labourers migrate from sowing/cropping of non-MSP to MSP crops. This increase in prices of food items, coupled with rising rural wages and incomes, could affect prices of non-food goods and services via second round effects (Ghate et al., 2018). The increase in the cotton MSP could directly affect inflation through retail clothing (Chart II.1.3).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"A sustained rise in CPI inflation excluding food and fuel started in H2:2017-18 and continued into H1:2018-19 _ it rose from 5.1 per cent in February to 6.4 per cent in June, before moderating to 6.2 per cent in July and further to 6.0 per cent in August (Chart II.13). Adjusted for the estimated HRA impact, CPI inflation excluding food and fuel was 5.5 per cent in H1:2018-19 (up to August) _ 70 bps lower than the actual outcome. Housing inflation contributed close to 30 per cent of the increase in CPI inflation excluding food and fuel in H1:2018-19 (up to August), largely reflecting the HRA increases of central government employees (Chart II.14). Adjusted for HRA, the housing group still contributed a fifth of overall increase in CPI inflation excluding food and fuel. The second largest contributor in this category was the transport and communication sub-group, largely reflecting increases in petrol and diesel pump prices and second-round effects on transport fares. Petrol (and diesel) pump prices during H1:2018-19 increased sharply by about _10 per litre, as international prices surged (Chart II.15). As a result, the contribution of petrol and diesel (with a weight of 2.3 per cent) to CPI excluding food and fuel inflation rose from 1.7 per cent in March 2018 to 8.6 per cent in August. Accentuating the impact of petrol and diesel on inflation in the recent period has been the asymmetric pass-through of international crude oil prices to domestic prices since 2014 (Chart II.15).Excluding food, fuel, petrol and diesel, CPI inflation increased from 5.2 per cent in February to peak at 6.2 per cent in June, before moderating to 5.8 per cent in July and to 5.7 per cent in August. Excluding the four volatile items _ petrol, diesel, gold and silver _ as well as housing, CPI inflation increased by 120 bps from February to 5.5 per cent in June, before moderating to 5.0_5.1 per cent in July_August (Chart II.13). The edging down of inflation in July and August was due to lower inflation prints in pan, tobacco and intoxicants, clothing and footwear, and miscellaneous groups.Inflation in respect of both goods and services in the CPI excluding food, fuel, petrol and diesel edged up during Q1:2018-19 (Chart II.16). For goods, inflation picked up across commodity groups, particularly medicines, clothing and footwear, bedding, utensils and washing powder. However, during July-August 2018, goods inflation moderated sharply by 80 bps, driven primarily by a fall in inflation in pan, tobacco and intoxicants group and personal care and effects sub-group (Chart II.16a). Services inflation rose in H1:2018-19 to reach a peak of 6.9 per cent in June, driven up largely by the HRA increases and an increase in tuition fees and prices of transportation services, as alluded to earlier. As the HRA effects started to wane, services inflation moderated to 6.5 per cent in August (Chart II.16b). Excluding the HRA impact, services inflation rose from 5.0 per cent in March and remained steady at 5.5 per cent during June-August. Communication services inflation, however, remained muted due to subdued prices in respect of cellular services.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Measures of inflation other than the CPI have shown mixed movements since the April MPR. After the HRA-linked spike in January 2018, inflation in terms of CPI for industrial workers (CPI-IW) declined in line with inflation in CPI for agricultural labourers (AL) and rural labourers (RL), reflecting inter alia soft food inflation readings. CPI-IW reflects changes in its housing index once in six months _ in January and July every year. The revision in CPI-IW housing index _ from 3.0 per cent in December 2017 to 10.2 per cent in January 2018 and further to 26.1 per cent in July _ created sizeable upside impulses pushing CPI-IW inflation significantly above headline CPI inflation in July.7 Accordingly, as the impact of the HRA increase intensified, CPI-IW inflation shot up to 5.6 per cent in August from 3.9 per cent in June.In contrast, wholesale price index (WPI) inflation firmed up significantly in Q1, driven up by international prices of crude petroleum and high speed diesel. Inflation in respect of electricity, naphtha, furnace oil, manufacture of plastic products, manufactured vegetable and animal oils and fats also fuelled WPI inflation. GDP and GVA deflators also ticked up in Q1 in line with WPI inflation (Chart II.17a) which moderated somewhat in July and August with the collapse in food inflation.Volatile prices of items such as transport fuel, vegetables, pulses and precious metals impart high dispersion, asymmetry and non-normality to the distribution of inflation. High positive as well as negative skew and chronic fat tails in the inflation distribution could be removed by trimming the outliers. Trimmed means of CPI, including its weighted median, rose sharply in Q1:2018-19 before softening in July and August (Chart II.17b).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Measures of inflation have largely tracked underlying cost conditions. In the case of industrial and farm costs in the WPI and remained elevated in Q2 so far (Chart II.18). The rise in global crude oil prices impacted domestic prices of inputs such as high speed diesel, aviation turbine fuel, naptha, bitumen, furnace oil and petroleum coke, pushing up domestic farm and nonfarm costs. Input cost pressures weakened slightly in July 2018, reflecting soft metal prices and transient easing of global crude oil prices.Among other industrial raw materials, domestic coal inflation slowed down significantly as compared with the previous year¡¯s level. Inflation in respect of paper and paper products has also remained moderate so far, reflecting inter alia cheap imports of paper under free trade agreements with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and South Korea. Inflation in prices of fibres (specifically cotton, jute and mesta) after remaining in negative territory during February to May 2018, picked up subsequently due to elevated international prices and lower production estimates for 2018-19 season.Among farm sector inputs, inflation in respect of agricultural input prices such as fertilisers increased gradually in line with international prices. Despite rising demand, prices of tractors remained stable on the back of increased competition as tractor firms aspired to expand their market shares. Inflation in respect of pesticides and other agrochemical products was driven by uptick in inflation in insecticide and pesticide even as deflation in fungicide prices continued. Prices of fodder remained in deflation due to increased production on the back of good monsoons during the last two years. Inflation in respect of electricity, which has a high weight in both industrial and farm inputs, rose significantly during May-August, reflecting mainly the price surge on account of supply disruptions in the summer following severe dust storms in northern India and adverse base effect in August. Additionally, the distribution companies (DISCOMS) raised their tariffs, following the diversion of coal supplies by the government away from captive power producers to thermal power plants with low stocks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Pressure from rising commodity prices was also reflected in an increase in input costs of manufacturing firms covered in the Reserve Bank¡¯s industrial outlook survey. These firms reported a rise in the cost of raw materials in Q2:2018-19 and expected it to increase further in Q3. However, they are not expecting to pass the entire cost burden to selling prices, reflecting still subdued pricing power. The manufacturing purchasing managers¡¯ index (PMI) as well as the services PMI point to an increase in the cost of raw materials in Q1 and Q2 so far. Firms covered in these indices also reported an increase in their selling prices, indicating that some pass-through of higher costs to clients may already be occurring.Going forward, inflation outcomes will be influenced by several factors. The government has announced measures aimed at ensuring remunerative prices to the farmers for their produce. The magnitude of the impact of these measures on CPI inflation will be contingent upon the manner and effectiveness with which these measures are implemented. Risks to inflation could emanate from rising geopolitical and trade tensions, with attendant implications for global commodity prices and financial markets. The impact of the 7th CPC HRA award on headline inflation has started waning and the effect of increases in HRA by states is not yet visible. As and when HRA awards by states start showing up in the CPI, it will impact headline inflation. As in the case of the centre¡¯s HRA, second round effects will warrant vigilance. The near-term inflation expectations of households and those of businesses polled in the forward-looking surveys of the Reserve Bank of India have firmed up over successive rounds, with the potential to feed into wages and input costs. While low food inflation prints and the positive outlook on food _ on account of supply management measures by government and a normal monsoon _ provide comfort, it is necessary to be watchful as several upside risks to inflation persist, notably from surging oil prices and volatile financial markets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Aggregate demand has been underpinned by the strengthening of private consumption and investment demand. The drag from external demand has reduced with a robust pick-up in non-oil merchandise exports. Aggregate supply conditions improved with a sharp acceleration in manufacturing and the resilience in agriculture and allied activities. Raising real investment activity on a durable basis holds the key to sustaining the growth momentum, going forward.Since the start of 2018, i.e., from the January-March 2018 quarter, economic activity in India appears to be charting a step-up in its trajectory. Quarterly estimates of the Central Statistics Office (CSO) for Q1:2018- 19 (April-June) confirm that gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 8 per cent in the January-June 2018 period, up from 6.6 per cent in the period July- December 2017. High frequency and survey-based indicators suggest that aggregate demand is fast catching up with aggregate supply. Sales growth, pick-up in capacity utilisation and the acceleration in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) space attest that the output gap has virtually closed.Meanwhile, another engine of aggregate demand has started to pick-up with the bounce-back in merchandise exports. On the supply side, the rapid catch-up in sowing activity, backed by ample reservoir storage, brightens the outlook for agriculture and allied activities on top of the record production in 2017-18. Industrial activity has strengthened and become more broad-based, buoyed by manufacturing. The services sector remains resilient, supported by strong growth in construction activity as well as public administration, defence and other services (PADO).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Measured by year-on-year (y-o-y) changes in real GDP at market prices, aggregate demand strengthened to 7.7 per cent in Q4:2017-18 and surged to a nine-quarter high of 8.2 per cent in Q1:2018-19 (Table III.1). This extended its sequential acceleration to four successive quarters, beginning in Q2:2017-18. Momentum, measured by q-o-q seasonally adjusted annualised rate (SAAR), however, moderated in Q1:2018-19 (Chart III.1a).Among its components, consumption expanded on the back of growth in private final consumption expenditure (PFCE), which reached a six-quarter high of 8.6 per cent in Q1:2018-19. Government final consumption expenditure (GFCE) decelerated to 7.6 per cent, albeit from a high of 16.9 per cent in Q4:2017-18. Investment demand embodied in the growth of gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) decelerated sequentially in Q1:2018-19; however, it remained reasonably strong at 10 per cent, given the government¡¯s thrust on national highways and low-cost housing. Despite a hostile and unpredictable international trading environment, growth of exports of goods and services jumped to a 16-quarter high of 12.7 per cent in Q1:2018-19, mitigating the negative contribution of net exports to aggregate demand caused by the unrelenting surge in imports (Chart III.1b).The actual outcome for the quarter overshot the projection by 90 basis points, reflecting larger than expected gains in most of the constituents of aggregate demand. First, private consumption demand surprised on the upside in Q1:2018-19 and touched a six-quarter peak. The April 2018 projection had assumed that lingering effects of the goods and services tax (GST) implementation would have an adverse impact on consumption demand _ especially in urban areas _ through loss of output and employment in unorganised activities. Furthermore, a sharp acceleration in allied activities in the agricultural sector posted a growth of 8.1 per cent in Q1:2018-19, which was significantly above trend. This is likely to have boosted rural consumption. Second, GFCF growth overshot the projection on account of stronger than expected capital goods production and the robust recovery in the construction sector.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"PFCE remained the mainstay of aggregate demand running ahead in Q1:2018-19 on the strength of rising rural and urban demand and undeterred by the surge in domestic prices of petroleum products. After rising since the beginning of 2017-18, wage (staff cost per employee) growth in the organised manufacturing and services sectors has remained range bound (see Chart II.20, Chapter II). However, in the information technology (IT) sector, growth in staff cost was robust in Q1:2018-19, which could have added to the purchasing power. In contrast, anecdotal evidence suggests that following a decline in exports and moderation in domestic production, growth in wage incomes could have moderated in some of the labour-intensive segments such as readymade garments, and jute manufactures, which, in turn, might have impacted consumption demand (Chart III.3).High frequency indicators of urban consumption present a mixed picture. While domestic air passenger traffic and production of consumer durables expanded during Q1 and Q2:2018-19 so far, sales of passenger cars contracted during July-August, after peaking in June, possibly as a response to the sharp rise in fuel prices (Chart III.4). Household credit demand in the form of personal loans and leasing of vehicles by commercial banks maintained a robust tempo (Chart III.5). Going forward, urban consumption is expected to strengthen further on the implementation of the 7th Central Pay Commission (CPC) awards by states and the recent reduction in GST rates.High frequency indicators of rural demand seem to be indicating a slight loss of momentum in Q2:2018- 19 (Chart III.6). Sales of motorcycles and tractors, which grew robustly during Q1:2018-19, decelerated in Q2 (July-August). Nevertheless, construction activity in rural areas has been buoyant since Q2:2017-18, supported by the government¡¯s thrust on rural housing and roads. Strong topline growth of FMCG companies, a sizeable part of which emanates from rural areas, also corroborates the improving dynamics of rural consumption. The latter should also benefit from the tailwinds of normal rains in large parts of the country, given the empirical evidence of a positive association of normal monsoon with growth in private consumption (Chart III.7).1 The sizeable increase in MSP of kharif crops announced in July 2018 is expected to augment incomes of rural households if it is implemented effectively.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Growth in gross fixed capital formation (GFCF), which had accelerated to a seven-quarter high of 14.4 per cent in Q4:2017-18, retained double-digit growth in Q1:2018-19 with some moderation in pace relative to the previous quarter. The share of GFCF in aggregate demand in Q1:2018-19 at 31.6 per cent was higher than 31.0 per cent a year ago, indicating improving investment demand. Robust investment activity was also reflected in several high frequency indicators such as steel consumption, cement production, and import of capital goods (Chart III.8). Strong growth in housing loans disbursed by scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) and especially housing finance companies also suggests rising investment in the construction sector.Capacity utilisation (seasonally adjusted) gained momentum and improved to 74.9 per cent in Q1:2018- 19, higher than the level recorded in the first quarter of the past year (Chart III.9). The number of stalled projects, though reported some improvement in both the private and government sectors in Q4:2017-18 and Q1:2018-19, there was a slight deterioration in government sector in Q2:2018-19 (Chart III.10).Since 2011-12, capital formation has decelerated due to the slowdown in investment in the private sector, weighed down, inter alia, by overhang of corporate debt (Chart III.11). Empirical analysis suggests that higher leverage constrains firms¡¯ ability to invest, resulting in slowdown in fresh investment (Box III.1).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"GFCE continued to support aggregate demand in Q1. The fiscal position of the central government showed an improvement in terms of key deficit indicators, as per cent of budget estimates (BE), during April-August 2018-19 as growth in revenue receipts exceeded that of expenditure (Table III.2). Tax revenues grew by 7.5 per cent, supported by higher income tax collections (Charts III.13a and b).Notwithstanding month-over-month fluctuations, the overall indirect tax base has expanded. Ongoing simplification of procedures and rationalisation of GST rates have encouraged voluntary compliance, especially in the business-to-business segment and small enterprises. Many registrants under the GST network (GSTN) were those who fell below the GST threshold but nevertheless chose to be a part of the GST. Similarly, more than 50 percent of those who could have chosen to opt for the simpler composition scheme chose to register under the regular GST scheme.3 States¡¯ own tax revenues, comprising mainly their collection under the state goods and services tax (SGST), have stabilised in recent months, though there is some uncertainty relating to the sharing of revenues from the integrated goods and services tax (IGST) between the centre and states and the transfer under GST compensation cess.4 Furthermore, non-tax revenues have shown a marked improvement for centre.On the expenditure front, accounts for April-August 2018-19 reveal a marked moderation in revenue expenditure mainly due to lower subsidy outgo. The quality of expenditure improved, with growth in capital expenditure _ at 20.6 per cent _ outpacing revenue expenditure. As regards states, the share of revenue expenditure in their total expenditure was estimated slightly lower at 83 per cent in their BE for 2018-19, though still higher than in 2015-16 and 2016-17 (Table III.3).There is a positive relationship between indebtedness of states (debt/GSDP) and their respective shares of revenue expenditure in total expenditure. This relationship is stronger in the case of non-special category states than in special category states5 (Chart III.14). States with high interest burden (higher interest payment as per cent of revenue expenditure) find it more difficult to control their revenue expenditure, thereby putting a strain on the quality of expenditure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"During 2017-18, the combined fiscal position of the centre and states deteriorated vis-¨¤-vis BE due to elevated revenue expenditure and subdued growth in revenue collection resulting from the teething problems with the GST implementation. Consequently, the fiscal deficit of centre and states deviated significantly from BE. The combined gross fiscal deficit (GFD) is budgeted to decline to 5.9 per cent of GDP in 2018-19 from 6.6 per cent in the revised estimates (RE) for 2017-18. Outstanding liabilities of the general government (centre and states) are budgeted to decline to 68.3 per cent of GDP by end-March 2019 from 68.9 per cent a year ago (RE).6 Concerted efforts towards consolidation will, however, be needed for achieving the revised Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) targets, i.e., the central government debt to GDP ratio of 40 per cent and the general government debt to GDP ratio of 60 per cent by 2024-25.The Reserve Bank managed the centre¡¯s market borrowing programme during 2018-19 so far as per the planned issuance schedule, despite reduced demand for government securities from foreign portfolio investors (FPIs). Against the budgeted market borrowing for 2018-19 at _6,055 billion (about 3 per cent higher than last year), the central government completed 47.6 per cent of its budgeted gross borrowings by end-September 2018 (64.1 per cent in the corresponding period of 2017-18). It decided not to front-load market borrowings in the first half of the year in a departure from the typical pattern of market borrowings (Table III.4). It has decided to reduce its budgeted market borrowings in the second half of the year by _705 billion, which will take the market borrowings for the full year to _5,350 billion against the budgeted _6,055 billion. The government expects that higher inflows in the National Small Savings Fund (NSSF) scheme and adjustments in buyback programme would enable it to meet the budgeted fiscal deficit target even with lower market borrowings. The states completed 27.6 per cent of their budgeted gross borrowings by end-September 2018 as against 36.7 per cent in the corresponding period of 2017-18. The bulk of market borrowings by the states would be in the second half of 2018-19.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Net exports continued to drag down aggregate demand in Q1:2018-19, though on a smaller scale than in the previous four quarters. India¡¯s merchandise exports recovered smartly from the implementation effects of the GST and rode on improving global demand to expand at 14.6 per cent in US dollar terms in Q1:2018-19, a step-up from the average of 10.1 per cent in the previous four quarters (Chart III.16a). The recovery in export growth was strongly supported by non-oil exports such as engineering goods, chemicals and drugs and pharmaceuticals (Chart III.17a). Oil exports too expanded, but mainly on the back of a surge in international crude oil prices. Merchandise import growth during Q1:2018-19 was the slowest in four quarters on account of an unfavourable base effect and a decline in gold imports. There was also some moderation in non-oil non-gold imports with the decline in imports of pearls and precious stones, pulses and vegetable oil (Chart III.17b). The combined impact of the escalation in international crude oil prices and a pick-up in import volumes pushed up the oil import bill to a 15-quarter high. Notwithstanding the improved export performance, India¡¯s merchandise trade deficit during Q1:2018-19 was the highest in last 20 quarters. During July-August 2018-19, both export and import growth improved. Exports benefitted from increased shipments of petroleum products, engineering goods and gems and jewellery. Petroleum, gold, coal and electronic goods supported import growth.In Q1:2018-19, 65 per cent of India¡¯s merchandise trade deficit was financed through invisibles, i.e., net export of services, income and remittances. Net services exports grew by 2.1 per cent on a y-o-y basis, primarily driven by exports of software and financial services. In gross terms, India¡¯s services export recorded a growth of 4.9 per cent in Q1:2018-19 (Chart III.16b). India accounts for a large share (13.1 per cent share in total exports of the top 10 exporting economies)7 of global exports of telecommunications, computer and information services. Major IT companies reported significant improvement in their export revenues in Q1:2018-19, which might also have extended into Q2:2018-19 in view of the weakness of the rupee. Optimistic forecasts of global IT spending in 2018 also bode well for the outlook for software exports. Net remittances _ mainly private transfers, which supplement gross domestic disposable income _ rose by 17.5 per cent in Q1:2018-19, reflecting firmer demand conditions in source countries as also rising international crude oil prices, both of which imply a favourable outlook for these flows. Despite increase in net receipts of services exports and remittances in Q1:2018-19, trade deficit caused a slight widening of the current account deficit to US$ 15.8 billion (2.4 per cent of GDP) as compared with US$ 15.0 billion (2.5 per cent of GDP) in Q1:2017-18.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The global growth and trade outlook is clouded by rising protectionist tensions. The direct impact of the recently announced tariffs by the US on India¡¯s exports is likely to be modest;8 however, the increase in US tariffs could lead to a supply glut in non-US markets and push prices down, resulting in lower export realisations for third party exporters like India. These risks appear to be materialising as the affected countries retaliate and protect domestic markets as already evident in tit-for-tat tariffs by the US and China. These developments could lead to a global trade slowdown with hysteresis, which, in turn, could diminish welfare, especially for countries looking to leverage on global trade to meet their growth aspirations.As regards financial flows in 2018-19 so far, net foreign direct investment (FDI) flows increased by 2.9 per cent in April-July 2018 over the corresponding period of the previous year. By contrast, FPI flows recorded net outflows of US$ 11.5 billion till September 28, 2018, reflecting mainly global portfolio rebalancing away from EMEs. While net receipts on account of non-resident deposits almost tripled in Q1:2018-19 from their level a year ago, both external commercial borrowings (ECBs) and short-term trade credit recorded outflows during the same period. Keeping in view the capital needs of the corporate sector, all-in-cost norms and end-use provisions were rationalised and the list of eligible borrowers was expanded for ECBs in April 2018. Despite the drawdown of reserves since April 2018, India¡¯s forex reserves at US$ 400.5 billion as on September 28, 2018 were at a comfortable level _ equivalent to 10 months of imports and 182 per cent of short-term external debt (by residual maturity).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The recovery in economic activity, which began in Q2:2017-18, seems to be robust. Consumption is expected to remain resilient, buoyed by rising income levels and staggered implementation of the 7th Central Pay Commission (CPC) award at the states¡¯ level in the urban areas. Rural consumption is likely to remain strong in view of the sizeable hike in MSPs and debt waivers by the states. The record agricultural production achieved in recent years, is expected to be maintained on the back of a hike in MSPs of kharif crops, normal monsoon rains in most of the kharif crop growing regions of the country and comfortable water reservoir storage. Easier supply conditions in the agrarian economy support backward and forward linkages and thereby brighten the prospects for the manufacturing and services sectors. Upbeat construction activity, fading away of the slack in banking sector financial intermediation activities, and higher public expenditure in an election year, suggest that stability of services sector growth would be maintained.A more durable momentum in investment activity holds the key to sustaining the Indian economy on the higher growth path that has become evident in the last two quarters. Rising capacity utilisation and improving credit offtake bode well for investment gaining traction. The deteriorating global trade and geo-political environment are, however, negative risks to the investment outlook.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Since the last meeting of the MPC in June 2018, global economic activity has continued to maintain steam; however, global growth has become uneven and risks to the outlook have increased with rising trade tensions. Among advanced economies (AEs), the US economy rebounded strongly in Q2, after modest growth in Q1, on the back of rising personal consumption expenditures and exports. In the Euro Area, weak growth in Q1 continued in Q2 due to subdued consumer demand, weighed down by political uncertainty and a strong currency. In Japan, recent data on retail sales, consumer confidence and business sentiment point to moderation in growth.Economic activity in major emerging market economies (EMEs) has slowed somewhat on volatile and elevated oil prices, mounting trade tensions and tightening of financial conditions. The Chinese economy lost some pace in Q2, pulled down by efforts to contain debt. The Russian economy picked up in Q1; recent data on employment, industrial production and exports indicate that the economy has gained further momentum. South Africa¡¯s economy contracted in Q1; though consumer sentiment has improved, high unemployment and weak exports pose challenges. In Brazil, economic activity suffered a setback in Q1 on nation-wide strikes; more recent data suggest that growth remained muted as industrial production contracted in May and the manufacturing purchasing managers¡¯ index (PMI) declined.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Global trade lost some traction due to intensification of trade wars and uncertainty stemming from Brexit negotiations. Crude oil prices, which remained volatile and elevated in May-June on a delicate demand-supply balance, eased modestly in the second half of July on higher supply from Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC producers. Base metal prices have fallen on the general risk-off sentiment triggered by fears of an intensification of trade wars. Gold prices have softened on a stronger dollar. Inflation remained firm in the US, reflecting higher oil prices and stronger aggregate demand. Inflation has edged up also in some other major advanced and emerging economies, driven, in part, by rising energy prices and pass-through effects from currency depreciations.Financial markets have continued to be driven mainly by monetary policy stances in major AEs and geopolitical tensions. Equity markets in AEs have declined on trade tensions and uncertainty relating to Brexit negotiations. Investors¡¯ appetite for EME assets has waned on increases in interest rates by the US Fed. The 10-year sovereign yield in the US has moderated somewhat from its peak on May 17 on safe-haven demand, spurred by escalating trade conflicts. Yields have softened in other key AEs as well. In most EMEs, however, movements in yields have varied reflecting domestic macroeconomic fundamentals and tightening global liquidity. Capital flows to EMEs declined in anticipation of monetary policy tightening in AEs. In currency markets, the US dollar appreciated, supported by strong economic data. The euro strengthened in June on receding political uncertainty and taper talk by the central bank. However, the currency has traded soft thereafter on mixed economic data and the rising US dollar. EME currencies, in general, have depreciated against the US dollar over the last month.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"On the domestic front, south-west monsoon has been recovering after a brief spell of deficiency in the second half of June. The cumulative rainfall up to July 31, 2018 was 6 per cent below the long-period average. In terms of spatial distribution, 28 of the 36 sub-divisions received normal or excess rainfall, whereas 8 sub-divisions received deficient rainfall as against three sub-divisions last year. The total sown area of kharif crops as on July 27 was 7.5 per cent lower than that a year ago. The live storage in major reservoirs as on July 26 was at 41 per cent of the full reservoir level compared with 36 per cent a year ago, which portends well for the rabi sowing season.Industrial growth, measured by the index of industrial production (IIP), strengthened in April-May 2018 on a y-o-y basis. This was driven mainly by a significant turnaround in the production of capital goods and consumer durables. Growth in the infrastructure/construction sector accelerated sharply, reflecting the government¡¯s thrust on national highways and rural housing, while the growth of consumer non-durables decelerated significantly. The output of eight core industries accelerated in June due to higher production in petroleum refinery products, steel, coal and cement. Capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector remains robust. The assessment based on the Reserve Bank¡¯s business expectations index (BEI) for Q1:2018-19 remained optimistic notwithstanding some softening in production, order books and exports. The July manufacturing PMI remained in expansion zone, although it eased from its level a month ago with slower growth in output, new orders and employment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Several high-frequency indicators of services activity increased at a faster pace in May-June. Tractor and two-wheeler sales growth accelerated significantly, suggesting strong rural demand. Passenger vehicle sales growth, an indicator of urban demand, also strengthened. Commercial vehicle sales growth remained robust despite some deceleration. Domestic air passenger traffic _ another indicator of urban demand _ maintained double-digit growth. Construction activity indicators also improved with cement production sustaining double digit growth for the eighth consecutive month in June. Steel consumption also accelerated in May. The services PMI expanded to a twelve-month high in June, after a marginal contraction in May, supported by expansion in new business and employment.Retail inflation, measured by the year-on-year change in the CPI, rose from 4.9 per cent in May to 5 per cent in June, driven by an uptick in inflation in fuel and in items other than food and fuel even as food inflation remained muted due to lower than usual seasonal uptick in prices of fruits and vegetables in summer months. Adjusting for the estimated impact of the 7th central pay commission¡¯s house rent allowances (HRA), headline inflation increased from 4.5 per cent in May to 4.6 per cent in June. Low inflation continued in cereals, meat, milk, oil, spices and non-alcoholic beverages, and pulses and sugar prices remained in deflation.Fuel and light group inflation rose sharply, pulled up by liquefied petroleum gas and kerosene. Inflation in firewood and chips ticked up, while electricity inflation remained low. The pass-through of global crude oil prices impacted inflation in domestic petroleum products as well as transport services. Inflation also picked up modestly in respect of education and health.The June round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s survey of households reported a further uptick of 20 basis points in inflation expectations for both three-month and one-year ahead horizons as compared with the last round. Manufacturing firms polled in the Reserve Bank¡¯s industrial outlook survey (IOS) reported higher input costs and selling prices in Q1:2018-19. The manufacturing PMI showed that input prices eased slightly in July, although they remained high. Input costs for companies polled in Services PMI in June also stayed elevated. Farm and non-farm input costs rose significantly. Notwithstanding some pick-up in February and March 2018, rural wage growth remained moderate, while wage growth in the organised sector remained firm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Systemic liquidity remained generally in surplus mode during June-July 2018. In June, the Reserve Bank absorbed surplus liquidity of around _ 140 billion on a daily net average basis under the LAF even as the system migrated from net surplus to a net deficit mode in the second half of the month due to advance tax outflows. Interest rates in the overnight call money market firmed up in June reflecting the increase in the repo rate on June 6, 2018. The weighted average call rate (WACR) traded, on an average, 12 basis points below the repo rate _ the same as in May. Systemic liquidity moved back into surplus mode in early July with increased government spending but turned into deficit from July 10 onwards; on a daily net average basis, the Reserve Bank injected liquidity under the LAF of _ 107 billion in July. The WACR in July, on an average, traded 9 basis points below the policy rate. Based on an assessment of prevailing liquidity conditions and of durable liquidity needs going forward, the Reserve Bank conducted two open market operation (OMO) purchase auctions of _ 100 billion each on June 21 and July 19, 2018.Export growth picked up in May and June 2018 on a y-o-y basis, aided by engineering goods, petroleum products, drugs and pharmaceuticals, and chemicals. Import growth also accelerated largely due to an increase in crude oil prices. Among non-oil imports, gold imports declined due to lower volume, while imports of machinery, coal, electronic goods, chemicals, and iron and steel increased sharply. Double-digit import growth in May and June pushed up the trade deficit. On the financing side, net foreign direct investment (FDI) flows improved significantly in the first two months of 2018-19. With the tightening of liquidity conditions in AEs, growing geopolitical concerns and with the escalation of protectionist sentiment, net foreign portfolio investment (FPI) outflows from the domestic capital market have continued, albeit at an increasingly slower rate. India¡¯s foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 404.2 billion on July 27, 2018.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"In the second bi-monthly resolution of 2018-19, CPI inflation for 2018-19 was projected at 4.8-4.9 per cent in H1 and 4.7 per cent in H2, including the HRA impact for central government employees, with risks tilted to the upside. Excluding the impact of HRA revisions, CPI inflation was projected at 4.6 per cent in H1 and 4.7 per cent in H2. Actual inflation outcomes have been slightly below the projected trajectory as the seasonal summer surge in vegetable prices has remained somewhat muted in comparison with its past behaviour and fruits prices have declined.The inflation outlook is likely to be shaped by several factors. First, the central government has decided to fix the minimum support prices (MSPs) of at least 150 per cent of the cost of production for all kharif crops for the sowing season of 2018-19. This increase in MSPs for kharif crops, which is much larger than the average increase seen in the past few years, will have a direct impact on food inflation and second round effects on headline inflation. A part of the increase in MSPs based on historical trends was already included in the June baseline projections. As such, only the incremental increase in MSPs over the average increase in the past will impact inflation projections. However, there is a considerable uncertainty and the exact impact would depend on the nature and scale of the government¡¯s procurement operations. Second, the overall performance of the monsoon so far augurs well for food inflation in the medium-term. Third, crude oil prices have moderated slightly, but remain at elevated levels. Fourth, the central government has reduced Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates on several goods and services. This will have some direct moderating impact on inflation, provided there is a pass-through of reduced GST rates to retail consumers. Fifth, inflation in items excluding food and fuel has been broad-based and has risen significantly in recent months, reflecting greater pass-through of rising input costs and improving demand conditions. Finally, financial markets continue to be volatile. Based on an assessment of the above-mentioned factors, inflation is projected at 4.6 per cent in Q2, 4.8 per cent in H2 of 2018-19 and 5.0 per cent in Q1:2019-20, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 1). Excluding the HRA impact, CPI inflation is projected at 4.4 per cent in Q2, 4.7-4.8 per cent in H2 and 5.0 per cent in Q1:2019-20.Turning to the growth outlook, various indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to be strong. The progress of the monsoon so far and a sharper than the usual increase in MSPs of kharif crops are expected to boost rural demand by raising farmers¡¯ income. Robust corporate earnings, especially of fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies, also reflect buoyant rural demand. Investment activity remains firm even as there has been some tightening of financing conditions in the recent period. Increased FDI flows in recent months and continued buoyant domestic capital market conditions bode well for investment activity. The Reserve Bank¡¯s IOS indicates that activity in the manufacturing sector is expected to remain robust in Q2, though there may be some moderation in pace. Rising trade tensions may, however, have an adverse impact on India¡¯s exports. Based on an overall assessment, GDP growth projection for 2018-19 is retained, as in the June statement, at 7.4 per cent, ranging 7.5-7.6 per cent in H1 and 7.3-7.4 per cent in H2, with risks evenly balanced; GDP growth for Q1:2019-20 is projected at 7.5 per cent (Chart 2).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Even as inflation projections for Q2 have been revised marginally downwards vis-¨¤-vis the June statement, projections for Q3 onwards remain broadly unchanged. Several risks persist. First, crude oil prices continue to be volatile and vulnerable to both upside and downside risks. In particular, while geopolitical tensions and supply disruptions remain an upside risk to oil prices, the fall in global demand due to further intensification of protectionist trade policies could pull down oil prices. Second, volatility in global financial markets continues to impart uncertainty to the inflation outlook. Third, households¡¯ inflation expectations, as measured by the Reserve Bank¡¯s survey, have risen significantly in the last two rounds, which could influence actual inflation outcomes in the months to come. Fourth, manufacturing firms polled in the Reserve Bank¡¯s industrial outlook survey have reported hardening of input price pressures in Q2 of 2018-19. However, if the recent softening of global commodity prices persists, it could mitigate some of the upward pressure on input costs. Fifth, though the monsoon has been normal temporally so far, its regional distribution needs to be carefully monitored in the context of key CPI components such as paddy. Sixth, in case there is fiscal slippage at the centre and/or state levels, it could have adverse implications for market volatility, crowd out private investment and impact the outlook for inflation. Seventh, uncertainty around the full impact of MSP on inflation will only resolve in the next several months once the price support schemes are implemented. Finally, the staggered impact of HRA revision by state governments may push headline inflation up. While the statistical impact of HRA revisions will be looked through, there is need to watch out for any second-round impact on inflation.Against the above backdrop, the MPC decided to increase the policy repo rate by 25 basis points. The MPC reiterates its commitment to achieving the medium-term target for headline inflation of 4 per cent on a durable basis.The MPC notes that domestic economic activity has continued to sustain momentum and the output gap has virtually closed. However, uncertainty around domestic inflation needs to be carefully monitored in the coming months. In addition, recent global developments raise some concerns. Rising trade protectionism poses a grave risk to near-term and long-term global growth prospects by adversely impacting investment, disrupting global supply chains and hampering productivity. Geopolitical tensions and elevated oil prices continue to be the other sources of risk to global growth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The Foreign Exchange Management (Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts) Regulations 2000, commonly known as FEMA 25, lays down the broad rules regarding foreign exchange derivative contracts that can be traded in India and access to such products by residents. Over the years, several amendments of FEMA 25 have been undertaken to make it easier for residents to hedge their currency risk and also widen the range of instruments available for hedging. It is now proposed to undertake a comprehensive review of FEMA 25, in consultation with the Government of India, to, inter alia, reduce the administrative requirements for undertaking derivative transactions, allow dynamic hedging, and allow Indian multinationals to hedge the currency risks of their global subsidiaries from India. Draft circular on the revised guidelines will be released for public comments by the end of September 2018.The Reserve Bank of India has been receiving, from time to time, requests for extension of timings for certain market segments such as currency futures, Over-the-Counter (OTC) foreign exchange market, etc. While the decision of market timings is best left to market participants and exchanges/trading platforms, it is necessary that timings across products and funding markets complement each other and avoid unanticipated frictions. It is, therefore, proposed, to set up an internal group to comprehensively review timings of various markets and the necessary payment infrastructure for supporting the recommended revisions to market timings. The proposed group will submit the report by the end of October 2018.
In order to facilitate greater participation in the government securities (G-Secs) markets and to provide market participants further operational ease in opening and operating of Subsidiary General Ledger (SGL) and Constituent Subsidiary General Ledger (CSGL) Accounts, it has been decided to review comprehensively the SGL/CSGL Guidelines. Notifications and Directions in this regard will be issued by the end of October 2018.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Since the last meeting of the MPC in April, global economic activity has continued to expand, though there has been some easing of momentum. Among advanced economies (AEs), the US economy began the year on a weak note on soft private spending and reduced residential investment; however, there seems to be a rebound in Q2:2018 with strong retail sales and improved employment data. The Euro Area growth decelerated in Q1; recent industrial production data as well as weak consumer and business sentiment suggest a loss of pace. The Japanese economy contracted in Q1, though it is expected to turn around in Q2 as indicated by recent data prints on exports and the manufacturing purchasing managers¡¯ index (PMI).Economic activity in major emerging market economies (EMEs) remained largely resilient. The Chinese economy maintained a strong momentum in Q1; more recent data on industrial production and PMI suggest that growth is likely to hold steady in Q2. The Russian economy appears to have picked up in recent months after a soft end to 2017; both manufacturing and services PMI rose in April. In South Africa, growth prospects have improved with the return of political stability as reflected in consumer confidence, manufacturing PMI and retail sales. In contrast, a stream of poor data from Brazil on high unemployment and soft industrial production show that the effects of recession linger.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Global trade growth has continued to strengthen, though geo-political tensions have contributed recently to declining export orders and air freight. Crude oil prices rose sharply till May 24 on heightened geo-political tensions, but moderated thereafter on expectations of easing of supplies by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia. Base metal prices, especially aluminium, have risen on account of US sanctions on Russia. Gold has witnessed selling pressure on a stronger dollar, but the metal gained last week on political uncertainty in the Euro Area. Inflation pressures have emerged in some key advanced and emerging economies, driven in part by rising commodity prices.Financial markets have been driven mainly by monetary policy expectations and geo-political developments. Equity market performance has varied across regions with modest gains in the AEs on strong Q1 earnings and abating of trade tensions, while stocks in major EMEs have faced sell offs on a rising dollar and expectations of further rate hikes by the Fed. The 10-year sovereign yield in the US crossed 3 per cent in mid-May on strong economic data as well as expectations of tighter monetary policy and fiscal expansion, but softened subsequently on safe haven demand; yields softened in other key AEs as well. In most EMEs, however, bond yields have risen on reduced foreign appetite for their debt due to growing dollar shortage in the global market and on prospects of higher interest rates in AEs. In currency markets, the US dollar touched its highest level in May since December 2017. The euro depreciated significantly against the dollar reflecting a combination of factors, including soft growth data for the Euro Area, which suggested that monetary policy normalisation by the European Central Bank could be delayed, and political uncertainty in its southern periphery. EME currencies have, by and large, depreciated against the US dollar.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"On the domestic front, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) released on May 31 the quarterly estimates of national income accounts for Q4:2017-18 and provisional estimates for 2017-18. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth for 2017-18 has been estimated at 6.7 per cent, up by 0.1 percentage point from the second advance estimates released on February 28. This increase in growth has been underpinned by a significant upward revision in private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) due especially to improved rural demand on the back of a bumper harvest and the government¡¯s thrust on rural housing and infrastructure. Quarterly data suggest that the economy grew at 7.7 per cent in Q4:2017-18 _ the fastest pace in the last seven quarters. Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) growth accelerated for three consecutive quarters up to Q4.On the supply side, estimates of agriculture and allied activities have been revised upwards, supported by an all-time high production of foodgrains and horticulture during the year. On a quarterly basis, agriculture growth increased sharply in Q4:2017-18. On April 16, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast a normal south-west monsoon rainfall, which was reaffirmed on May 30. This augurs well for the agricultural sector.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Industrial growth also strengthened, reflecting the robust performance of manufacturing, which accelerated for three consecutive quarters in Q4. Capacity utilisation by manufacturing firms increased significantly in Q4:2017-18 as revealed in the latest round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s order books, inventories and capacity utilisation survey (OBICUS). The output of eight core industries accelerated in April on account of a sharp expansion in coal production, which reached a 42-month peak. Cement output also posted double-digit growth for the sixth consecutive month in April. However, electricity generation slowed down. As per the early results of the Reserve Bank¡¯s April-June round of the industrial outlook survey (IOS), activity is expected to expand at a lower rate in Q1:2018-19 due to a significant rise in input prices and perceptions of softening domestic and external demand conditions. However, the manufacturing PMI remained in an expansionary mode for the tenth consecutive month in May on the back of new domestic orders and exports.Although services sector growth was revised downwards on account of lower growth in some constituents such as trade, hotels, transport & communication, and financial services, it remained robust. Construction activity recorded the highest growth in Q4 in the new series (base 2011-12). Various high frequency indicators also suggest resilient performance of the services sector. Improving sales of tractors and two-wheelers suggest strengthening of rural demand. Commercial vehicle sales also accelerated in April. Revenue-earning freight traffic of railways picked up, driven by improved movement in coal, fertilisers, and cement. Growth in passenger vehicle sales accelerated but port traffic decelerated for the third successive month in April. Domestic air passenger traffic rose significantly in April. Two key indicators of construction activity showed improvement _ cement production growth accelerated and steel consumption turned around. Services PMI moved slightly into contraction in May, reflecting decline in business activity and stagnation in new orders.Retail inflation, measured by the year-on-year change in the CPI, rose sharply to 4.6 per cent in April, driven mainly by a significant increase in inflation excluding food and fuel. Excluding the estimated impact of an increase in house rent allowances (HRAs) for central government employees, headline inflation was at 4.2 per cent in April, up from 3.9 per cent in March. Food inflation moderated for the fourth successive month, pulled down by vegetables due to lower than the usual seasonal increase in their prices, and pulses and sugar which continued to experience deflation. However, within the food group, inflation increased in respect of cereals, fruits, prepared meals, meat and fish.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Fuel group inflation declined for the fifth month in a row in April mainly on account of a fall in the inflation of liquefied petroleum gas in line with international prices, and electricity. However, inflation in other major items of fuel such as firewood and chips, dung cake, kerosene and coal inched up. Inflation in the transport and communication sub-group accelerated due to the firming up of international crude oil prices, even though the domestic pass-through to petrol and diesel was incomplete. Inflation also picked up in clothing, household goods and services, health, recreation, education, and personal care and effects.The May 2018 round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s survey of households reported a significant rise in households¡¯ inflation expectations of 90 basis points (bps) and 130 bps, respectively, for three-month and one-year ahead horizons. Manufacturing firms polled in the Reserve Bank¡¯s IOS reported input price pressures and an increase in selling prices in Q1:2018-19. Firms polled for the manufacturing PMI in May also showed a sharp increase in input and output prices. Farm inputs and industrial raw material costs have risen sequentially. Wage pressures in the rural sector moderated; however, those in the organised sectors remained firm.Liquidity in the system remained generally in surplus during April-May 2018. During April, the Reserve Bank absorbed surplus liquidity of _496 billion on a daily net average basis due to increased government spending, especially in the second half of the month. Reflecting easy liquidity conditions, the weighted average call rate (WACR) softened to 5.89 per cent in April (from 5.96 per cent in March). However, surplus liquidity in the system moderated considerably in the first half of May and the system moved into deficit in the third week of May mainly due to inflows on account of the goods and services tax (GST). The Reserve Bank conducted an open market operation purchase auction on May 17, 2018 to inject liquidity of _100 billion into the system. The system again turned into surplus in the last week of May reflecting mainly the payment of food subsidies. Surplus liquidity absorbed under the LAF on a daily net average basis declined to _142 billion in May. The WACR in May at 5.88 per cent remained broadly at the April 2018 level.India¡¯s exports grew in April 2018 after a marginal dip in the preceding month, supported mainly by non-oil exports, particularly engineering goods and chemicals. Import growth decelerated sequentially in April 2018; a significant decline in imports of gold as well as pearl and precious stones more than offset the impact of rising crude oil prices. Nevertheless, the trade deficit expanded in March and April from its level a year ago. External financing remained comfortable in 2017-18. While net foreign direct investment in 2017-18 was broadly comparable with the previous year, net foreign portfolio flows were stronger due to a sharp turnaround in debt inflows. However, foreign portfolio investors withdrew US$ 6.7 billion on a net basis from the domestic capital market in 2018-19 (up to June 4) reflecting volatility in global financial markets. India¡¯s foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 412 billion on June 1, 2018.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The first bi-monthly resolution of 2018-19 in April projected CPI inflation in the range of 4.7-5.1 per cent in H1:2018-19 and 4.4 per cent in H2, including the HRA impact for central government employees with risks tilted to the upside. Excluding the impact of HRA revisions, CPI inflation was projected at 4.4-4.7 per cent in H1:2018-19 and 4.4 per cent in H2. Actual inflation outcomes since the April policy have evolved broadly on the lines of the projected trajectory. However, there has been an important compositional shift. While the summer momentum in vegetable prices was weaker than the usual pattern, there was an abrupt acceleration in CPI inflation excluding food and fuel.The headline inflation outlook is driven primarily by two countervailing effects. On the one hand, CPI inflation excluding food and fuel rose sharply in April over March by 80 basis points to reach an ex-HRA level of 5.3 per cent, suggesting a hardening of underlying inflationary pressures. Furthermore, since the MPC¡¯s meeting in early April, the price of Indian basket of crude surged from US$ 66 a barrel to US$ 74. This, along with an increase in other global commodity prices and recent global financial market developments, has resulted in a firming up of input cost pressures, as also confirmed in the Reserve Bank¡¯s IOS for manufacturing firms in Q2:2018-19. The resulting pick-up in the momentum of inflation excluding food, fuel and HRA has imparted persistence into higher CPI projections for 2018-19. On the other hand, food inflation has remained muted over the past few months and the usual seasonal pickup delayed, softening the projections in the short run. Taking these effects into account, projected CPI inflation for 2018-19 is revised to 4.8-4.9 per cent in H1 and 4.7 per cent in H2, including the HRA impact for central government employees, with risks tilted to the upside (Chart 1). Excluding the impact of HRA revisions, CPI inflation is projected at 4.6 per cent in H1 and 4.7 per cent in H2.Turning to the growth outlook, the CSO¡¯s provisional estimates have placed GDP growth for Q4:2017-18 at 7.7 per cent _ 70 basis points higher than that in Q3 _ given the sharp acceleration in investment and construction activity. With improving capacity utilisation and credit offtake, investment activity is expected to remain robust even as there has been some tightening of financing conditions in recent months. Global demand has also been buoyant, which should encourage exports and provide a further thrust to investment. The sharp rise in petroleum product prices, however, is likely to impact disposable incomes. Consumption, both rural and urban, remains healthy and is expected to strengthen further. According to the early results of the Reserve Bank¡¯s IOS, activity in the manufacturing sector is expected to moderate marginally in Q2:2018-19 on account of deterioration in the overall business situation and order book. On the basis of an overall assessment, GDP growth for 2018-19 is retained at 7.4 per cent as in the April policy. GDP growth is projected in the range of 7.5-7.6 per cent in H1 and 7.3-7.4 per cent in H2, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"A major upside risk to the baseline inflation path in the April resolution has materialised, viz., 12 per cent increase in the price of Indian crude basket, which was sharper, earlier than expected and seems to be durable. Crude oil prices have been volatile recently and this imparts considerable uncertainty to the inflation outlook _ both on the upside and the downside. Several other risks remain. First, global financial market developments have emerged as another important source of uncertainty. Second, the significant rise in households¡¯ inflation expectations as gathered in the May 2018 round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s survey could feed into wages and input costs in the coming months. However, the pass-through to output prices remains muted presently. Third, the staggered impact of HRA revisions by various state governments may push headline inflation up. While the statistical impact of HRA revisions will be looked through, there is a need to watch out for any second round impact on inflation. Fourth, the impact of the revision in the MSP formula for kharif crops is not possible to assess at this stage in the absence of adequate details. Fifth, as forecast by the IMD, if the monsoon is normal and well-distributed temporally and spatially, it may help keep food inflation benign.Against the above backdrop, the MPC decided to increase the policy repo rate by 25 basis points and keep the stance neutral. The MPC reiterates its commitment to achieving the medium-term target for headline inflation of 4 per cent on a durable basis.The MPC notes that domestic economic activity has exhibited sustained revival in recent quarters and the output gap has almost closed. Investment activity, in particular, is recovering well and could receive a further boost from swift resolution of distressed sectors of the economy under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. Geo-political risks, global financial market volatility and the threat of trade protectionism pose headwinds to the domestic recovery. It is important that public finances do not crowd out private sector investment activity at this crucial juncture. Adherence to budgetary targets by the Centre and the States _ which appears to be the case thus far _ will also ease upside risks to the inflation outlook considerably.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"As per the existing roadmap, scheduled commercial banks have to reach the minimum Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of 100 per cent by January 1, 2019. Presently, the assets allowed as Level 1 High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLAs) for the purpose of computing LCR of banks include, inter alia, Government securities in excess of the minimum SLR requirement and, within the mandatory SLR requirement, Government securities to the extent allowed by the Reserve Bank under Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) [presently 2 per cent of the bank's NDTL] and under Facility to Avail Liquidity for Liquidity Coverage Ratio (FALLCR) [presently 9 per cent of the bank's NDTL]. For the purpose of computing LCR, it has been decided that, in addition to the above-mentioned assets, banks will be permitted to reckon as Level 1 HQLAs Government securities held by them upto another 2 per cent of their NDTL under FALLCR within the mandatory SLR requirement. Hence, the total carve-out from SLR available to banks would be 13 per cent of their NDTL. The other prescriptions in respect of LCR remain unchanged. As per extant guidelines on prudential norms for classification, valuation and operation of investment portfolio by banks, the state government securities are valued applying the Yield to Maturity (YTM) method with a uniform mark-up of 25 basis points above the yield of the Central Government securities (G-Secs) of equivalent maturity.It has now been decided that the securities issued by each state government should be valued based on observed prices. The valuation of traded state government securities shall be at the price at which they have been traded in the market. In case of non-traded state government securities, the valuation shall be based on the state-specific weighted average spread over the yield of the central government securities of equivalent maturity, as observed at primary auctions. The detailed guidelines to this effect will be issued separately by June 20, 2018.In the wake of spurt in the yields of government securities, banks were given an option to spread, over four quarters, the mark-to-market losses recorded on their investment portfolio during the quarters ended December 2017 and March 2018. It was also required that banks build an Investment Fluctuation Reserve (IFR) of 2 percent of their holdings in the AFS and HFT categories to avoid such eventualities. In view of the continuing rise in yield of government securities as also the inadequacy of time to build IFR for many banks, it has been decided to grant banks the option to spread the mark-to-market (MTM) losses on investments held in Available for Sale (AFS) and Held for Trading (HFT) portfolio for the quarter ending June 30, 2018, equally over a period of four quarters, commencing from the quarter ending June 30, 2018.

This was done with a view to ease the transition of MSMEs to the formalised sector post their registration under the GST.Having regard to the input credit linkages and associated issues, it has now been decided to temporarily allow banks and NBFCs to classify their exposure, as per the 180 day past due criterion, to all MSMEs with aggregate credit facilities up to the above limit, including those not registered under GST. Accordingly, eligible MSME accounts, which were standard as on August 31, 2017, shall continue to be classified as standard by banks and NBFCs if the payments due as on September 1, 2017 and falling due thereafter up to December 31, 2018 were/are paid not later than 180 days from their original due date.In view of the benefits from increasing formalisation of the economy for financial stability, the 180 day past due criterion, in respect of dues payable by GST registered MSMEs from January 1, 2019 onwards, shall be aligned to the extant norm of 90 day past due in a phased manner, whereas for entities that do not get registered under GST by December 31, 2018, the asset classification in respect of dues payable from January 1, 2019 onwards shall immediately revert to the 90 day norm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A circular in this regard shall be issued by June 30, 2018.After a careful analysis of the Housing Loans data, it has been observed that the level of NPAs for the ticket size of up to Rupees two lakh has been high and is rising briskly. Banks need to strengthen their screening and follow up in respect of lending to this segment in particular. The Reserve Bank is closely monitoring this sector and will consider appropriate policy response such as a tightening of the LTV ratios and/or an increase in the risk weights, should the need arise.Core Investment Companies (CICs) registered with the Reserve Bank as Non-Bank Financial Companies (NBFCs) primarily invest in group companies and do not carry out any other NBFC activity. They are required to invest in group companies in the form of equity shares, preference shares, bonds, debentures, debt or loans, at least up to 90 per cent of their net assets, while equity investments in group companies must constitute at least 60 per cent of net assets.

In the Euro Area, economic activity remained buoyant, although consumer spending and factory activity slowed down due to the strengthening of the euro, but a consistently falling unemployment rate and elevated consumer confidence continued to underpin the strength of the economy. The Japanese economy registered eight straight quarters of growth till Q4:2017; available data for 2018 point to a slower start to the year with weak machinery orders and an easing manufacturing Purchasing Manager¡¯s Index (PMI) in February-March.Economic activity remained robust in emerging market economies (EMEs) in Q1:2018. The Chinese economy started the year on a strong note; retail sales picked up pace indicating robust consumption, while industrial production also registered a strong increase in Q1:2018 on improved mining and manufacturing activity. In Brazil, economic activity is gaining momentum, driven by higher commodity prices. The Russian economy continued to recover in Q1; industrial production expanded in January-February, after two months of contraction, while exports grew at a robust pace. In South Africa, leading indicators, viz., the manufacturing PMI and business confidence, improved in Q1.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"World trade volume growth is expected to have been robust in Q1, as gauged from the data on container trade throughput, air freight and export orders. Crude oil prices have become volatile in the recent period. After softening in February from multi-year highs on increased production in the US, crude prices hardened in the second half of March, driven by rebalancing of supply by OPEC and Russia, and drawdown of US inventories. Metal prices have come under selling pressure, with copper touching a three-month low in March on uncertainty stemming from global trade protectionism and US monetary policy. Gold prices, which touched a two-month low in March, have recently witnessed some uptick on fears of intensification of a trade war. Inflation remains below target in many key AEs and EMEs.Financial markets turned volatile in February-March, triggered by uncertainty regarding the pace of normalisation of US monetary policy, and concerns surrounding global trade. Equity markets globally have shed most of the gains of the previous quarter in a heavy sell off in February-March, caused by optimistic US job reports and the US imposition of new tariffs on Chinese goods. Yields in the US traded sideways on weaker than expected inflation pressures and the anticipated rate hike by the Fed. Yields in other major AEs have fallen, while among EMEs, they have remained divergent on country-specific factors. In currency markets, the US dollar, which recovered somewhat in early March on an optimistic outlook of the economy, shed most of its gains in the latter part of the month on a less hawkish stance of the Fed and on anxieties surrounding a possible trade war. Among other major currencies, the euro continued to appreciate on an improving growth outlook for the region. Most EME currencies have retreated in the wake of the recent market volatility and the improving US economic outlook, though investors continued to discriminate on country-specific factors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Turning to the domestic economy, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) released its second advance estimates for 2017-18 on February 28, revising India¡¯s real gross domestic product (GDP) growth marginally upward to 6.6 per cent from 6.5 per cent in the first advance estimates released on January 5. GDP growth in 2017-18 at 6.6 per cent was lower than 7.1 per cent in 2016-17 and the deceleration was broad-based, but each component revealed intra-year turning points. Private consumption growth _ whose contribution to GDP growth in 2017-18 was 68 per cent _ moderated in the second half. Goods and services tax (GST) implementation had an adverse, even if transient, effect on urban consumption through loss of output and employment in the labour-intensive unorganised sector. Government expenditure provided sustained support to aggregate demand, with a pick-up in pace in the second half. Gross fixed capital formation turned around in Q2 and accelerated in the second half _ markedly so in Q3 _ reflecting the first signs of a sustained expansion in capital goods production and a modest revival of construction activity. Net exports dragged down aggregate demand in 2017-18 due to a surge in imports and deceleration in exports in Q3, the latter being driven in part by GST-related working capital disruptions.For Q4, high frequency indicators point to a further strengthening of demand conditions. Private consumption seems to be improving on the back of strong growth in domestic air passenger traffic and foreign tourist arrivals, rising sales growth of passenger vehicles and a strong upturn in the production of consumer durables. The growth in sales of two-wheelers and tractors reflects buoyant rural consumption. Capital goods production registered a 19-month high growth in January 2018, indicative of the likely traction in investment demand. Housing loans extended by banks have increased significantly, which is a positive for residential investment. External demand remains a weak link. Merchandise import growth has slowed because of gold imports; simultaneously export growth has also weakened.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Turning to the supply side at a disaggregated sectoral level, the kharif foodgrains production for 2017-18 has been revised upward by 2.8 per cent in the second advance estimates released in February 2018 as compared with the first advance estimates released in September 2017. Total foodgrains production for 2017-18 is estimated at 277.5 million tonnes, up by 0.9 per cent from the level of 2016-17, with the production of rice, pulses and coarse cereals estimated to reach a record high. Wheat production is estimated to be lower than last year due to a decline in acreage and low soil moisture, but imports of 1.6 million tonnes and comfortable buffer stocks should cushion potential adverse effects. Horticulture production touched a new peak of 305.4 million tonnes in 2017-18, up by 1.6 per cent from last year.For the year 2017-18 as a whole, the CSO estimates that value added in industry decelerated in relation to the previous year; in terms of quarterly performance, however, expansion set in by Q2 and was built upon in Q3 and Q4. This was mainly driven by the rebound in manufacturing. The manufacturing PMI remained in an expansionary mode for the eighth consecutive month in March, although there was some moderation in Q4. Assessment of overall business sentiment for manufacturing also improved in Q4 as reflected in the Reserve Bank¡¯s Industrial Outlook Survey, driven by increasing output and new orders. Growth of value added in the services sector accelerated through the year, driven by trade, hotels, transport and communication and a significant pick-up in construction activity. Other high frequency indicators of services sector activity such as domestic air passenger traffic, international freight traffic, port traffic and commercial vehicles sales also expanded at a fair pace. The services PMI moved out of contraction and stabilised in March on a renewed increase in new business and strengthening expectations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Retail inflation, measured by the year-on-year change in the CPI, fell from a high of 5.1 per cent in January to 4.4 per cent in February due to a decline in inflation in food and fuel. Excluding the estimated impact of an increase in the house rent allowances (HRA) for central government employees under the 7th central pay commission (CPC), the headline inflation for February was at 4.1 per cent. Food inflation declined by 120 bps in February, pulled down by a sharp decline in vegetable prices, especially of onions and tomatoes, along with continuing deflation in pulses. The fall in prices was also observed in other food components such as eggs, sugar, meat and fish, oils, spices, cereals and milk.In the fuel and light group, inflation in respect of liquefied petroleum gas declined in line with international price movements. Furthermore, the rate of increase in prices of firewood and chips, and dung cake moderated.CPI inflation excluding food and fuel remained unchanged at 5.2 per cent for the third consecutive month in February, after rising from its trough in June 2017. Among its constituents, housing group inflation rose significantly, reflecting the HRA increase for central government employees. Excluding the HRA impact, inflation in this group was estimated markedly lower at 4.4 per cent. Inflation in the transport and communication group increased in February on account of the rise in petroleum product prices and transportation fares. Inflation either eased or remained at a low level in February in other major sub-groups such as household goods and services, recreation and amusement, education, and personal care and effects.Households¡¯ inflation expectations, measured by the March 2018 round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s survey of households, edged up for both three-month and one-year ahead horizons. Manufacturing firms covered in the Reserve Bank¡¯s Industrial Outlook Survey reported input price pressures and an increase in selling prices in Q4:2017-18, which are expected to continue in Q1:2018-19. Manufacturing and services firms polled by PMI also showed a rise in input and output prices in Q4.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Liquidity in the system moved between surplus and deficit during February-March 2018. From a daily net average surplus of _ 272 billion during February 1-11, 2018, liquidity moved into deficit during February 12-March 1, reflecting a slowdown in government spending and large tax collections. After turning into surplus during March 2-15, the system moved into deficit again during March 16-22 mainly on account of quarterly advance tax outflows. Anticipating the seasonal tightening of liquidity at the end of March, the Reserve Bank conducted four additional longer tenor (24-31 days) variable rate repo operations aggregating _ 1 trillion, apart from the regular repo operations. In mid-March, additional liquidity of _ 1 trillion got released into the system through redemption of Treasury Bills issued under the Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS) in April and May 2017. On the whole, the Reserve Bank injected _ 60 billion and _ 213 billion on a net daily average basis in February and March, respectively. The weighted average call rate (WACR) inched closer to the policy repo rate from 12 basis points below the policy rate in January to 7 bps in February, and 5 bps in March.Merchandise export growth decelerated in January and February 2018, pulled down by a slowdown in exports of gems and jewellery, readymade garments and engineering goods. Import growth also moderated in February due to a decline in gold imports, lower growth in non-oil non-gold imports, and contraction in imports of transport equipment, vegetable oils and pulses. As import growth continued to exceed export growth in January-February, the trade deficit widened. The current account deficit increased in Q3:2017-18, primarily on account of the higher trade deficit. Net foreign direct investment moderated in April-January 2017-18 vis-¨¤-vis the level a year ago. Foreign portfolio investors made net purchases in 2017-18, despite net sales in the wake of a global sell-off in February. India¡¯s foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 424.4 billion on March 30, 2018.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The 6th bi-monthly resolution of 2017-18 in February projected CPI inflation at 5.1 per cent in Q4:2017-18; and in the range of 5.1-5.6 per cent in H1:2018-19 and 4.5-4.6 per cent in H2, including the HRA impact, with risks tilted to the upside. Actual inflation outcomes in January-February averaged 4.8 per cent, largely reflecting the sharp decline in vegetable prices and significant moderation in fuel group inflation. The available information suggests that vegetable prices continued to moderate in March as well. Accordingly, inflation in Q4:2017-18 is now projected at 4.5 per cent.Several factors are likely to influence the inflation outlook. First, with the sharp moderation in food prices in February-March, the inflation trajectory in H1:2018-19 is expected to be lower than the projection in the February statement, despite a likely reversal in food prices in H1. Overall food inflation should remain under check on the assumption of a normal monsoon and effective supply management by the Government. Second, international crude oil prices have become volatile in the recent period, with a distinct hardening bias in the second half of March, even as the increase in shale production was more than expected. This has adversely impacted the outlook for crude oil prices. Third, on current assessment, Indian domestic demand is expected to strengthen during the course of the year. Fourth, the statistical impact of an increase in HRA for central government employees under the 7th CPC will continue till mid-2018, and gradually dissipate thereafter.Taking these factors into consideration, projected CPI inflation for 2018-19 is revised to 4.7-5.1 per cent in H1:2018-19 and 4.4 per cent in H2, including the HRA impact for central government employees, with risks tilted to the upside (Chart 1). Excluding the impact of HRA revisions, CPI inflation is projected at 4.4-4.7 per cent in H1:2018-19 and 4.4 per cent in H2.Turning to the growth outlook, several factors are expected to accelerate the pace of economic activity in 2018-19. First, there are now clearer signs of revival in investment activity as reflected in the sustained expansion in capital goods production and still rising imports, albeit at a slower pace than in January. Second, global demand has been improving, which should encourage exports and boost fresh investment. On the whole, GDP growth is projected to strengthen from 6.6 per cent in 2017-18 to 7.4 per cent in 2018-19 _ in the range of 7.3-7.4 per cent in H1 and 7.3-7.6 per cent in H2 _ with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The MPC notes that there are several uncertainties surrounding the baseline inflation path. First, the revised formula for MSP as announced in the Union Budget 2018-19 for kharif crops may have an impact on inflation, although the exact magnitude will be known only in the coming months. Second, the staggered impact of HRA revisions by various state governments may push headline inflation up. While the statistical impact of the HRA revisions will be looked through, there is a need to watch out for any second round effects. Third, in case there is any further fiscal slippage from the Union Budget estimates for 2018-19 or the medium-term path, it could adversely impact the outlook on inflation. There are also risks to inflation from fiscal slippages at the level of states on account of higher committed revenue expenditure. Fourth, should the monsoon turn deficient temporally and/or spatially, it may have a significant bearing on food inflation. Fifth, firms polled in the Reserve Bank¡¯s Industrial Outlook Survey expect input and output prices to rise, going forward. Sixth, recent volatility in crude prices has imparted considerable uncertainty to the near-term outlook.Against the above backdrop, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate on hold and continue with the neutral stance. The MPC reiterates its commitment to achieving the medium-term target for headline inflation of 4 per cent on a durable basis.The MPC notes that growth has been recovering and the output gap is closing. This is also reflected in a pick-up in credit offtake in recent months. The large mobilisation of resources from the primary capital market should support investment activity further. While the domestic cyclical recovery is underway, the long-term growth potential is also expected to be reinforced by various structural reforms introduced in the recent past. On the downside, the deterioration in public finances risks crowding out private financing and investment. Furthermore, even as global growth and trade have been strengthening, rising trade protectionism and financial market volatility could derail the ongoing global recovery. In this unsettling global environment, it is especially important that domestic macroeconomic fundamentals are strengthened, deleveraging of distressed corporates and rebuilding of bank balance sheets persisted with, and the risk-sharing markets deepened.Dr. Chetan Ghate, Dr. Pami Dua, Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, Dr. Viral V. Acharya and Dr. Urjit R. Patel voted in favour of the monetary policy decision. Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra voted for an increase in the policy rate of 25 basis points. The minutes of the MPC¡¯s meeting will be published by April 19, 2018.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Inflation is expected to firm up during the first quarter of 2018-19 before moderating in the remaining part of 2018-19 as the direct impact of the increase in house rent allowances for central government employees fades away, which has to be looked through. Economic activity is expected to accelerate with the strengthening of investment activity, supported by consumption demand and robust credit growth.The Monetary Policy Report (MPR) of October 2017 flagged significant shifts underway in the macroeconomic environment. Some of them have gained traction since then while others are incipiently in motion. Global economic activity has continued to strengthen and is becoming increasingly synchronised across regions. Global trade is outpacing demand after lagging behind for two years. Oil prices have firmed up again on the edge of a delicate demand-supply balance. Generally buoyant global financial markets have been interrupted by bouts of volatility triggered by several event-specific announcement effects, and most recently by reassessments of the pace of monetary policy normalisation in the US. Renewed fears of protectionism, retaliatory actions and trade wars pose a major challenge to the global economy, with implications for emerging market economies (EMEs), including India, that are participating in open international trade and relying on foreign capital flows to realise their developmental aspirations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"After languishing for five consecutive quarters, economic activity in India is quickening, as estimates and high frequency as well as survey-based indicators etch out for the second half of 2017-18. Growth is strengthening and several elements are coming together to nurture this nascent acceleration: expectations of a record foodgrains output; strong sales growth by corporations; depleting finished goods inventories; and, restart of investment in fixed assets by corporations pointing to renewal of the capex cycle. Several services sectors, including the information technology sector in terms of its international competitiveness, have shown resilience. These are some of the developments that support brighter prospects for the Indian economy in 2018-19. A significant development has been that this time around, the step-up in growth is propelled by a revival of investment on the demand side and manufacturing on the supply side. This outlook will be lifted by tailwinds from remonetisation and implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST).The path of inflation will likely be influenced by effects of the increase in house rent allowances (HRAs) for central government employees, which is purely statistical and has to be looked through to gauge true inflation developments. As this effect wanes, inflation could moderate in the remaining part of 2018-19 from an upturn in Q1 under the baseline assumptions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met in December 2017 and February 2018 in accordance with the pre-announced bi-monthly schedule. The MPC voted to keep the policy rate on hold in these meetings, maintaining its neutral stance of the fourth bi-monthly resolution of October 2017. The MPC¡¯s resolutions as well as individual minutes and voting patterns reflected concerns about the changing inflation trajectory _ upside risks to the inflation outlook from food and fuel prices, rising input cost conditions, fiscal slippages, and volatile global financial markets in its December resolution; and increase in HRAs by state governments, crude oil and other commodity prices, revisions to minimum support prices (MSPs) and fiscal slippages in its February resolution. The seasonal moderation in prices of vegetables and fruits, subdued capacity utilisation, and moderate rural real wage growth were seen as mitigating factors.Against this backdrop, the MPC voted in December by a majority of 5-1 to maintain status quo on the policy rate, while continuing with a neutral stance. As in the October meeting, one member voted for a rate cut to support economic activity. In February, the MPC persevered with status quo on the policy rate with a vote of 5-1 and a neutral stance, while reiterating its commitment to keep headline inflation close to 4 per cent on a durable basis. In view of several drivers of inflation firing at the same time and the upper tolerance band of inflation target under threat, one member voted for a 25 basis points (bps) increase in the policy rate to commence the withdrawal of accommodation. These subtle variations in voting patterns reflecting individual members¡¯ views on the current and evolving macroeconomic outlook as well as policy preferences on the weights they assign to deviations of inflation and output from target/ potential are also observed in recent experiences of the MPCs in other countries (Table I.1).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"First, crude oil prices (Indian basket) firmed up from US$ 56 a barrel in October 2017 to US$ 67 a barrel in January 2018 (Chart I.1). Thereafter, they have fluctuated between US$ 60 and US$ 67. With the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) extending production cuts through the end of 2018 and the drawdown of inventories to meet increasing demand, being buffeted somewhat by the response of US shale oil production, the baseline scenario assumes crude oil prices (Indian basket) to average around US$ 68 a barrel in 2018-19.Second, the exchange rate (Indian rupee vis-¨¤-vis the US dollar) has exhibited two-way movements since October 2017. It appreciated till the early part of January 2018 on buoyant capital inflows and weakening of the US dollar. Subsequently, it depreciated from early February, following the release of stronger than expected US non-farm payrolls and wages data that fuelled expectations of a faster pace of interest rate increases by the US Federal Reserve and over concerns of the impact of higher crude oil prices on India¡¯s trade deficit. By March, the exchange rate of the rupee was close to its October 2017 level.Third, the pace of global economic activity in 2017 turned out to be stronger than expected due to robust growth in the advanced economies (AEs) and significantly stronger growth in EMEs. Global growth is expected to accelerate further in 2018, benefitting from the boost to investment demand in the US from corporate tax cuts, robust recovery in the euro area and generally improved growth outlook in EMEs (Chart I.2). The sharp recovery in world trade is expected to sustain in 2018 and enlarge the prospects of another year of strong and resilient global activity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Headline CPI inflation reached a peak of 5.2 per cent in December 2017 (4.9 per cent, excluding the estimated impact of HRA for central government employees), reflecting an unseasonal spike in the prices of vegetables and the full impact of the central government implementing the 7th Central Pay Commission¡¯s (CPC¡¯s) HRA award. The delayed setting in of the seasonal food prices moderation took down headline inflation to 4.4 per cent in February (4.1 per cent, excluding the estimated impact of HRA for central government employees). It is likely that this softening will keep the reading for March benign before it reverses in April. The incidence and strength of this reversal will condition monetary policy responses in 2018-19.Turning to the outlook, inflation expectations of urban households remain elevated, according to the March 2018 round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s survey.1 Inflation expectations three months ahead and a year ahead increased by 30 bps and 10 bps, respectively, from the previous round (December) to 7.8 per cent and 8.6 per cent, respectively. The proportion of respondents expecting the general price level to increase by more than the current rate declined for both three months and one year horizons (Chart I.3).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Manufacturing firms polled in the Reserve Bank¡¯s industrial outlook survey (March 2018) expected higher input price pressures in Q1:2018-19 due to rising cost of raw materials (higher negative values for cost of raw materials indicate higher input price pressures) (Chart I.4).2 Selling prices are also expected to increase, but not sufficient to protect profit margins. The Nikkei¡¯s purchasing managers¡¯ survey also indicates both input and output price pressures for manufacturing (March 2018) as well as services (February 2018) sectors.Professional forecasters surveyed by the Reserve Bank in March 2018 expect CPI inflation to firm up to 5.1 per cent in Q1:2018-19 and moderate thereafter to 4.3 per cent in Q4:2018-19 (Chart I.5).3 Their medium-term inflation expectations (5 years ahead) remained unchanged at 4.5 per cent, while longer-term inflation expectations (10 years ahead) increased by 40 bps to 4.5 per cent.Taking into account the initial conditions, signals from the forward looking surveys and estimates from structural and other models, CPI inflation is projected to pick up from 4.4 per cent in February 2018 to 5.1 per cent in Q1:2018-19 due to unfavourable base effects and then moderate to 4.7 per cent in Q2, and 4.4 per cent in Q3 and Q4, with risks tilted to the upside (Chart I.6). It may be noted that the direct impact of the increase in the HRA announced by the Central Government fades away fully by December 2018. The 50 per cent and the 70 per cent confidence intervals for inflation in Q4:2018-19 are 3.2-5.9 per cent and 2.5-6.7 per cent, respectively. Excluding the estimated impact of HRA for central government employees, CPI inflation would pick up from 4.1 per cent in February 2018 to 4.7 per cent in Q1:2018-19 and then moderate to 4.4 per cent in Q2, Q3 and Q4.For 2019-20, assuming a normal monsoon and no major exogenous/policy shocks, structural model estimates indicate that inflation will move in a range of 4.5-4.6 per cent. The 50 per cent and the 70 per cent confidence intervals for Q4:2019-20 are 3.0-6.1 per cent and 2.2-7.0 per cent, respectively.There are a number of upside risks to the baseline forecasts. Although the direct impact on headline inflation is statistical and should be looked through for policy purposes, second order effects of the expected increases in HRA, including by state governments, can impact inflation expectations. Other major risks to the inflation outlook are crude oil and other commodity prices, the proposed revisions to MSPs for kharif crops, and fiscal slippage at both the central and state levels.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Going forward, economic activity is expected to gather pace in 2018-19, benefitting from a conducive domestic and global environment. First, the teething troubles relating to implementation of the GST are receding. Second, credit off-take has improved in the recent period and is becoming increasingly broad-based, which portends well for the manufacturing sector and new investment activity. Third, large resource mobilisation from the primary market could strengthen investment activity further in the period ahead. Fourth, the process of recapitalisation of public sector banks and resolution of distressed assets under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) may improve the business and investment environment. Fifth, global trade growth has accelerated, which should encourage exports and reduce the drag from net exports. Sixth, the thrust on rural and infrastructure sectors in the Union Budget could rejuvenate rural demand and also crowd in private investment.Notwithstanding these salubrious developments, consumer confidence dipped in the March 2018 round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s survey, with the respondents expecting a moderation over the year ahead in general economic conditions, employment situation and their income (Chart I.7).4 Overall sentiment in the manufacturing sector a quarter ahead also fell in the March 2018 round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s industrial outlook survey under the weight of weaker prospects for production, order books, capacity utilisation, employment and profit margins (Chart I.8).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"In the March 2018 round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s survey, professional forecasters expected real gross domestic product (GDP) growth to pick up marginally from 7.2 per cent in Q3:2017-18 to 7.3 per cent in Q1:2018-19 and remain at 7.2 per cent in Q2-Q4 (Chart I.9 and Table I.4).Taking into account the baseline assumptions, survey indicators and model forecasts, real GDP growth is projected to improve from 6.6 per cent in 2017-18 to 7.4 per cent in 2018-19 _ 7.3 per cent in Q1, 7.4 per cent in Q2, 7.3 per cent in Q3 and 7.6 per cent in Q4 _ with risks evenly balanced around this baseline path.5 For 2019-20, the structural model estimates indicate real GDP growth at 7.7 per cent, with quarterly growth rates in the range of 7.4-7.9 per cent, assuming a normal monsoon, and no major exogenous/policy shocks (Chart I.10).Risks to the baseline growth scenario need to be monitored carefully. First, the uncertainty associated with the pace and timing of normalisation of monetary policy in the US and other major AE central banks has led to recurrent bouts of volatility in international financial markets which may have an adverse impact on capital flows and overall investment sentiment, including for EMEs through the ¡°finance¡± channel. Second, protectionist measures in the US and the generalised threat of a trade war can exacerbate volatility in global financial markets, with spillovers to domestic financial markets and adverse implications for the growth outlook. Large revisions in past data on national accounts statistics also pose a challenge to forecasts (Box I.1).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The baseline scenario assumes global growth to gain upward momentum during 2018, buoyed by the boost to US investment demand from corporate tax cuts, strong activity in the euro area supported by accommodative monetary policy and improvement in growth prospects of EMEs. There are upside risks to the baseline with the synchronised cyclical rebound, revival of global trade and easy financing conditions reinforcing each other. If global growth turns out to be 50 bps over the baseline, it could strengthen domestic growth by 20 bps above the baseline and raise domestic inflation by around 10 bps.On the other hand, protectionist policies, continuing uncertainty associated with the pace and timing of normalisation of monetary policy in the US and other systemic central banks, and higher crude oil prices pose downside risks to global demand. In such a scenario, if global demand weakens by 50 bps vis-¨¤-vis the baseline, domestic growth and inflation could be 20 bps and around 10 bps, respectively, below the baseline.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The exchange rate of the Indian rupee vis-¨¤-vis the US dollar has moved in both directions in recent months. Changing market perceptions about the pace and timing of monetary policy normalisation in the US, along with domestic inflation, fiscal slippage and current account balance developments, have been important factors driving exchange rate movements in the recent period and are likely to remain so in the near-term. With economic activity gathering pace in the euro area, uncertainty surrounding normalisation plans of the European Central Bank is likely to add to financial market volatility. The US macroeconomic policy mix _ easy fiscal policy in an environment when monetary accommodation is being withdrawn _ can accentuate market volatility. Assuming a depreciation of the Indian rupee by around 5 per cent relative to the baseline, inflation could edge higher by around 20 bps and the boost to net exports could increase growth by around 15 bps. On the other hand, with growth picking up in recent months, sound domestic fundamentals and the various initiatives taken by the Government to boost investment, India may continue to be an attractive destination for foreign investment, which could put upward pressures on the currency. An appreciation of the Indian rupee by 5 per cent in this scenario could soften inflation by around 20 bps and reduce growth by around 15 bps in 2018-19.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"To summarise, aggregate demand is expected to improve in 2018-19, supported, inter alia, by the improving GST implementation, the recapitalisation of public sector banks and the resolution of distressed assets under the IBC. Rural and infrastructure sectors are identified as thrust areas in the Union Budget, which could energise aggregate demand. With the acceleration in global trade, the Indian economy could benefit from buoyant external demand. In addition to the usual monsoon related uncertainty, inflation faces upside risks from a variety of other sources, especially due to the oil prices, the fiscal slippage, and (the statistical effect from) the expected increases in HRAs by the state governments, The purely direct statistical impact of the HRA adjustment on CPI will be looked through while formulating monetary policy. Uncertainty over the pace and timing of monetary policy normalisation by the systemic central banks in advanced economies, protectionist tendencies and fears of a trade war pose significant risks to the baseline inflation and growth paths.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Consumer price inflation rose sharply in Q3:2017-18, driven up by a spike in food prices and by the disbursement of enhanced house rent allowance (HRA) for central government employees, the latter alone contributing an estimated 35 basis points. It moderated somewhat in Q4 on a delayed seasonal easing of prices of vegetables. Industrial input costs increased through H2:2017-18, tracking movements in international commodity prices. Wage pressures have remained moderate in both the organised and rural sectors.The course of consumer price index (CPI) inflation in Q3 was significantly influenced by house rent allowance (HRA) increase for central government employees from July 2017, following the recommendations of the 7th central pay commission (CPC).1 The HRA impact contributed 35 basis points to the rise in headline inflation to its recent peak of 5.2 per cent in December, following the chain base method of compilation of the housing index in the CPI.2 Adjusted for the estimated HRA impact, headline inflation was 4.9 per cent in December. The HRA impact on inflation excluding food and fuel was even larger at around 75 basis points, adjusting for which it would have been lower at 4.4 per cent in December. Food inflation rose sharply in Q3 pushed by the unseasonal pick-up in prices of vegetables; and fuel inflation accelerated due to an uptick in inflation in liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), kerosene, coke and electricity. In Q4, headline inflation eased to 4.4 per cent by February 2018 with the seasonal softening in prices of vegetables. Excluding the HRA impact, headline inflation was 4.1 per cent and inflation excluding food and fuel remained unchanged at 4.4 per cent (Chart II.1).The MPR of October 2017 had projected CPI inflation to increase to 4.2 per cent in Q3 of 2017-18 and further to 4.6 per cent in Q4, based on a prognosis of unfavourable base effects and the play-out of the increase in HRA for central government employees. Actual inflation outcomes in Q3 were in alignment with the direction of the projected trajectory, but in levels, they turned out to be 35 basis points higher than forecast due to a combination of shocks. First, an unseasonal spike in the prices of onions and tomatoes during October-November 2017 caused prices of vegetables to soar, propelling inflation in this category to close to 30 per cent in December. Second, fuel inflation rose sharply during October-November on the back of an escalation in LPG prices. Third, international crude oil prices started firming up further from October. By end-December 2017, they were US$ 10 per barrel above the baseline assumption of US$ 55 per barrel. The pass-through to CPI inflation was, however, muted in Q3 due to excise duty cuts in early October and lagged mark-ups by oil marketing companies (OMCs). In Q4, most of the factors imposing these upward price pressures reversed. The winter downturn in prices of vegetables accentuated in January. Domestic LPG prices also eased in February, tracking international prices. As a result, the deviation between the actual and the projected inflation narrowed in Q4 to 15 bps (Chart II.2).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The increase in HRA for central government employees, which became effective from July 2017 and continued to accumulate till December 2017, shaped the path of headline inflation during Q3, with unseasonal hardening of prices of vegetables, accentuating a spike to 4.9 per cent in November. While prices of vegetables did undergo a shallower than usual moderation in December, an unfavourable base effect came into play, pulling up inflation to a peak of 5.2 per cent in December. In Q4, headline inflation moderated with a fall in momentum due to a delayed but steep reversal in prices of vegetables (Chart II.3).The distribution of inflation across CPI groups in 2017-18 had striking similarities as well as divergences with last year¡¯s experience. While median and modal inflation were similar, the continuing deflation in pulses gave the inflation distribution a considerable negative skew this year in contrast to the positive skew generated by high sugar and pulses inflation during 2016-17 (Chart II.4). Diffusion indices3 of price changes in CPI items suggest that on a seasonally adjusted basis, after an uptick in Q3:2017-18, the situation reversed in January-February, with the prices of a number of goods, particularly of food items, registering decline (Chart II.5).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Underlying cost conditions have mostly co-moved with measures of inflation, ticking up in H2:2017-18, notwithstanding some moderation in Q4. Y-o-y growth in farm input costs slipped temporarily into negative territory in January 2018 (Chart II.18). The rise in global crude oil prices and the hardening of metal prices fuelled the rise in input costs from August 2017 onwards and contributed to the turnaround in domestic non-farm input costs as they got passed on to inputs such as high speed diesel, aviation turbine fuel, naptha, bitumen, furnace oil and lube oils.Among other industrial raw materials, domestic coal inflation generally remained high during the year, tracking the surge in international coal prices and domestic supply shortages. However, inflation in other inputs depicted a mixed behaviour. In the case of oilseeds, inflation picked up during H2:2017-18, whereas in the case of fibres and paper and pulp, inflation moderated during the same period. Inflation in electricity, which carries a high weight in both industrial and farm inputs, rose during September-October 2017, but turned negative thereafter. Among other farm sector inputs, diesel prices increased sharply from August 2017, mirroring international prices, while prices of inputs such as tractors and fodder increased sharply in February 2018 after contracting in the preceding months. Fertiliser prices also recorded some upward pressure during December-February.Going forward, a key risk to the inflation outlook is the risk of fiscal slippages in a scenario of rising aggregate demand. As noted in the MPC resolution of February 2018, apart from the direct impact on inflation, the fiscal risks could also engender a broader weakening of macro-financial conditions. The revised guidelines for arriving at the MSPs for kharif crops proposed in the Union Budget 2018-19, along with proposed increase in customs duty on a number of items, is likely to push-up inflation over the year. In addition, how various state governments implement and disburse HRA increases would have a considerable bearing on CPI housing inflation and consequently on the headline inflation trajectory, albeit statistically, during 2018-19; therefore, the latter should be looked through for monetary policy purposes, other than for their second-round effects. Although the central government's HRA effects on CPI inflation would gradually wane from July 2018, this moderating impact could be more than offset if several state governments simultaneously implement HRA increases in H2:2018-19 (Chapter 1).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Government final consumption expenditure (GFCE) provided sustained support to aggregate demand in H2:2017-18, picking up in Q3:2017-18 on top of the front-loading of expenditure by the central government in Q1:2017-18. GFCE will likely continue to augment aggregate demand going forward into 2018-19, in view of the deviation of 0.3 per cent of GDP from the path of fiscal consolidation announced in the Union Budget (Table III.2). The gross fiscal deficit (GFD) target of 3.0 per cent of GDP has been deferred to 2020-21.In 2017-18 (April-February), there was a deterioration in the fiscal position of the central government on account of a sharp increase in expenditure combined with a decline in non-tax revenue relative to budget estimates. Revenue expenditure has evolved as budgeted, although payments under food and petroleum subsidies have been higher than a year ago. In the revised estimates for 2017-18, the outgo on account of major subsidies was estimated at 1.4 per cent of GDP, up from 1.3 per cent in 2016-17.Various categories of revenue expenditure take the form of committed payments with little room for cutbacks. Meanwhile, capital expenditure rose by 38.3 per cent up to February and constituted 108.6 per cent of the revised estimates (which were revised downwards from the budget estimates for the year). Accordingly, to meet the revised estimates, budgetary adjustments in the remaining part of the year might not involve any capex reduction, which has been stepped up over a wide area comprising civil aviation, defence, heavy industry, petroleum & natural gas, railways, shipping and road transport, including highways.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Financial market conditions in the second half of 2017-18 were marked by the weighted average call money rate (WACR) moving closer to the policy repo rate as surplus liquidity moderated; stock markets scaling new highs before undergoing some corrections; firming up of bond yields; and, the foreign exchange market switching from buoyant to ebbing portfolio flows. As credit offtake picked up, monetary policy transmission gained further traction for new loans.Global financial markets generally remained buoyant through the second half of 2017, boosted by the improving macroeconomic outlook and the gradual normalisation of the US monetary policy. While equity markets surged on a renewed appetite for risk, currencies were lifted by the weakening of the US dollar since November. Yield curves in bond markets tended to flatten with still subdued inflation expectations, and corporate credit spreads narrowed. In 2018, however, market sentiment has been dampened by accelerating wage and employment growth in the US, triggering fears of a faster pace of interest rate increases. Longer term interest rates have been hardening tracking US yields, but also in response to country-specific developments. oscillating geo-political developments and more recent fears of a trade war in response to the US tariff announcements have heightened uncertainty considerably. Volatility has pervaded various market segments, with equity and bond market sell offs spilling across geographies. Currency markets have been hit by the turbulence of safe haven flights that are rotating capital flows among emerging economies and sporadically strengthening the US dollar. Financial markets have remained on edge in recent weeks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"In domestic financial markets, various segments have exhibited diverse movements. While money markets remained laden with the overhang of liquidity that characterised the first half of the year, surplus liquidity has gradually ebbed and turned into deficit since February. As recourse to primary liquidity became pronounced from mid-December, overnight interest rates have begun ¡®middling¡¯ within the LAF corridor more frequently (Chart IV.1). Little farther out on the term curve, however, interest rates on Treasury bills (T-Bills) and discount rates on commercial papers (CPs) are hardening as markets sense that liquidity conditions are balancing out. In bond markets, long-term yields rose unrelentingly from August on apprehensions of excessive issuances, reactions to fiscal slippages following the announcement of the Union Budget for 2018-19, and rising inflation expectations peaking in early March. A spike in international crude price and rise in global interest rates contributed to the hardening of yields. Thereafter, yields declined sharply on favourable inflation print for February 2018 and in response to the lower than expected borrowings indicated by the Government in the issuance calendar for H1:2018-19. Corporate bonds also rose in sync, although credit spreads moderated with the improving outlook on growth.Until the Budget announcement, equity markets scaled new peaks, riding on aggressive buying by domestic mutual funds and foreign portfolio investors. Thereafter, corrections are occurring with bearish sentiment being more freely expressed in the equity market. The Union Budget proposal to levy long-term capital gains tax (LTCG) of 10 per cent on gains exceeding _1 lakh from sale of equity shares, sharp increase in US bond yields, the announcement of protectionist tariffs by the US and revelations of fraud in some domestic banks have impacted equity markets adversely since the beginning of February. The foreign exchange segment has moved in tandem; while the rupee had gained against the US dollar on the back of sustained portfolio inflows with the ebullience in equity markets, sentiment had reversed after the Budget announcement and portfolio outflows picked up from mid-February as global cues weighed on the rupee.In the credit market, activity is slowly gaining strength, despite the overhang of corporate loan delinquencies. The total flow of financial resources to the commercial sector in 2017-18 was much higher than that during the previous year, primarily due to an increase in non-food credit by banks. Credit demand surged in the second half of 2017-18 - though at divergent pace across bank-groups - with the growth pick-up spreading across sectors as underlying macroeconomic conditions improved. Both deposit and lending rates eased up to November as the cumulative reduction in the policy rate of 200 basis points since January 2015 was fully transmitted to new loans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"As set out above, domestic financial market segments have been mainly driven by idiosyncratic factors, barring phases of overwhelming global spillovers that impacted equity and forex markets intermittently. Excess liquidity, which had persisted till January following demonetisation, turned into deficit towards close of the year. Bond markets have experienced some drying up of liquidity as yields rose amidst concerns about inflation and the fiscal situation. The credit market, which was overcast with risk aversion and disintermediation, has exhibited a steady improvement in recent months with credit growth being in double digits since December. Sizeable investments by mutual funds into equity displaced the hitherto dominant position of foreign investors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"In the unsecured call money market, private banks and primary dealers are the major borrowers, and cooperative banks and public sector banks are the major lenders. In terms of intra-day activity, a distinct U-shaped pattern is discernible, with the thickest part of trading _ more than 60 per cent of daily call money transactions _ occurring in the first hour (9-10 am) when primary dealers are most active as borrowers, and in the last hour (4-5 pm) when the call money market becomes the only source of market liquidity for banks and primary dealers. In both these time segments, public sector banks are the largest lenders. Co-operative banks accounted for 39 per cent of call money lending during the second half of 2017-18, down from 46 per cent in the first half.The demonetisation-induced slosh of liquidity hung heavily over the market in October and November. Amplified by the effects of the Reserve Bank¡¯s forex operations, it continued to impart a downside bias to the weighted average call rate (WACR), as in the preceding two quarters (Chart IV.1). By mid-December, however, liquidity tightened with advance tax outflows. Restrained government spending impacted call money market conditions from February and firmed up interest rates. As net liquidity absorption under the LAF steadily shrank through the second half of 2017-18, the spread between the WACR and the policy repo rate narrowed from (-)13 basis points in September 2017 to (-)5 basis points in March 2018 (Chart IV.2). With the narrowing of the LAF corridor to 50 basis points in April 2017 from 100 bps earlier, volatility in the call money market has reduced, while the volume has remained broadly unchanged at less than 10 per cent of the total overnight market (Charts IV.3 and IV.4).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"In the Collateralised Borrowing and Lending Obligation (CBLO) segment, which constitutes more than 60 per cent of the overnight market, banks are usually on the borrowing side, while mutual funds (MFs) are the major lenders. The share of MFs in CBLO lending, which had gone up to as much as 80 per cent in March 2017 in the wake of demonetisation, has gradually subsided during the year to more normal levels, averaging around 60-70 per cent up to March 2018. Intra-day trading is largely concentrated in the first hour in alignment with the call money segment and spikes around 1-2.30 pm due to stepped-up activity by associate members: market participants such as mutual funds and insurance companies who do not have current accounts with the Reserve Bank and are not allowed into the market beyond 2.30 pm (in order to provide for adequate time for settlement of fund obligations for these members who settle at designated settlement banks) (Chart IV.5). Trading volumes and rates fall sharply in the CBLO segment on reporting Fridays to escape the application of the cash reserve ratio (CRR)1.The collateralised market repo segment accounts for 30 per cent of the overall overnight market turnover. Typically, the turnover in the market repo segment comprises ¡®basket repos¡¯, in which foreign banks are the major lenders as they prefer market repo for lending because of its collateralised nature, and ¡®specials¡¯ that are used by market participants for acquiring specific securities to deliver against their outstanding short positions. In the second half of 2017-18, the shares of basket repo and special repo turnover in the market repo segment¡¯s turnover were 55 per cent and 45 per cent, respectively, as against 57 per cent and 43 per cent in the first half. Interest rates in the collateralised segments, i.e., CBLO and market repo, evolved with a soft bias relative to the WACR and, in fact, traded 10 basis points and 2 basis points, respectively, below the WACR on average through the second half of 2017-18.Barring term premia, interest rates on certificates of deposits (CDs), commercial paper (CPs) and 91-day Treasury bills (T-Bills) generally evolve in alignment with the WACR (Chart IV.6). From mid- December, however, they have diverged on higher interest rates for lending beyond March-end on the consideration of year-end demand for funds for balance sheet management purposes _ a usual seasonal phenomenon _ though this divergence was initially triggered by the announcement of additional market borrowing by the government. In recent years, CPs have been increasingly resorted to as credit substitutes for working capital requirements as CP rates continue to rule significantly lower than bank lending rates. Consequently, issuances of CPs picked up to _11,448 billion in the second half of 2017-18 as against _9,125 billion a year ago. As surplus liquidity shrank, fresh issuances of CDs also went up to _2,181 billion from just _1,017 billion in the second half of 2016-17.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Since the beginning of August 2017, yields in the secondary government securities (G-sec) market hardened almost monotonically, driven mostly by domestic factors up to early March 2018 (Chart IV.7). G-sec yields hardened by 20 bps in October mainly due to informal communication by the government in late September that gross fiscal deficit (GFD) could be higher, increase in inflation forecast by the monetary policy committee (MPC) on October 4 and concerns over increase in the supply of papers in the form of bank recapitalisation bonds announced on October 24, 2017. G-Sec yields hardened by 20 bps during November 2017 partly due to fiscal concerns.2 Moody¡¯s rating upgrade on November 17, 2017 and the cancellation of open market sales scheduled for November 23, provided transient relief to the market. In December, the upside tilt in the balance of risks set out in the resolution of the MPC on December 6, concerns about rising inflation following December 12 release of inflation print and the communication on December 27, 2017 that fiscal slippage will be funded by additional market borrowings by the central government led to a rise in yields by 27 bps. Among global factors, rising international crude prices through the quarter and the increase of 25 basis points in the federal funds target on December 13, 2017 meeting of the FOMC pushed up the G-sec yields. On the whole, G-sec yields rose by 67 bps during Q3:2017-18. Over the same period, US yields rose by 8 bps.In Q4, notwithstanding the announcement of reduction of additional borrowings by the central government by _300 billion (from the amount of _500 billion extra borrowing announced in December) on January 17, 2018, the upward pressure on yields resumed from mid-January as still elevated crude prices and spillovers from episodes of global bond sell-off accentuated fears of oversupply of domestic paper. These fears materialised with the fiscal slippage announced in the Union Budget on February 1. Yields traded with a tightening bias till early March, scaling a two-year peak of 7.81 per cent on March 5, 2018. However, yields softened sharply by around 45 bps thereafter due to the lower inflation print for February released on March 12 and the decision by the Government not to front-load its borrowings in H1:2018-19 which resulted in a sharp fall in G-sec yields of 29 bps in a single day on March 27, 2018. As a result, the 10-year yield softened by 7 bps in Q4:2017-18 as against a rise of 36 bps in US yields.Reflecting these developments, the yield curve underwent level shifts through the second half of 2017-18, including in respect of the new benchmark paper issued on January 5, 2018 (Chart IV.8). An empirical analysis suggests that the sensitivity of bond yields in India to global factors represented by the US bond yield has declined in the recent period (although it has risen gradually since Q3), while its responsiveness to domestic factors has increased. Time-varying parameter estimates indicate that the effect of inflation on bond yields in India has increased significantly, especially since August 2017 (Chart IV.9)3.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Persisting positive yield differentials between global (US treasuries) and Indian G-secs and the stability of the Indian rupee in the foreign exchange market relative to other currencies provided congenial conditions for foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) who were net buyers in the debt market during the most part of H2 (Chart IV.10), notwithstanding intermittent reversals following the Budget announcement. FPIs made investment of _606 billion in G-secs in 2017-18, resulting in utilisation of 92.9 per cent of the extant limit on G-sec investment. In addition, FIIs also made investment in state development loans (SDLs) of _40 billion.In the primary segment, two discerning features characterised opposite ends of the spectrum. At the short end of the G-sec market, T-Bill issuances declined during H2 with the steady improvement in the central government¡¯s cash balances. Yields on T-Bills, however tracked the benchmark and hardened till February before cooling down during March owing to surplus liquidity emerging from the redemption of T-Bills issued under Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS) in April-May 2017 (Chart IV.11).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"At the longer end, the issuances of SDLs moderated in Q3, partly in reaction to the tightening financial conditions in the bond market. However, issuances peaked in Q4 reflecting the increased expenditure by the States towards end of the financial year. The weighted average spreads over the 10-year G-sec yield moderated to 56 bps in H2 as compared with 63 bps in H1 (Chart IV.12). There were no issuances under the UDAY scheme during 2017-18 and the total secondary market trading volume (face value) of UDAY bonds was _898 billion.Following the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission, all states (barring Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala and Arunachal Pradesh) have been excluded from the National Small Savings Fund (NSSF) financing facility beginning 2016-17. Consequently, market borrowings of states increased, also triggered by large redemptions of past borrowings. This drove up the supply of SDLs, which in turn impacted yields in the bond market, already reeling under the pressures of oversupply of paper.The relationship between the spread on SDLs and fiscal situation of individual States remained weak during 2017-18. The inter-state spread during the year at 6 bps was marginally lower than that of 7 bps in 2016-17.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Corporate bond yields hardened during H2:2017- 18 tracking the rising G-sec yields (Chart IV.13a). In contrast, credit spread, i.e., the spreads of corporate bond yields over G-sec yields of corresponding maturity narrowed from September 2017 onwards, barring intermittent spikes during December and January. The spreads of 5-year AA rated corporate bonds yields declined by 16 basis points, reflecting improvement in financing conditions on the back of higher corporate earnings in a brightening macroeconomic outlook, and with the prospects of speedy resolution of insolvency under the bankruptcy code. Empirical analysis suggests that credit spreads increase with amplification of credit risks as captured through credit default swap (CDS) spreads, and increase in global liquidity risks measured by the Libor-OIS spread. However, spreads reduce with an increase in earnings prospects as reflected in 12-month forward price-to-earning-ratios4. Average daily turnover in the corporate bond market increased to _75.6 billion during H2:2017-18 (up to March 27, 2018) from _70.6 billion a year ago; however, the tightening of credit conditions reflected in hardening of corporate bond yields during H2: 2017-18 prompted corporates to shift to banks for meeting their funding requirements. Consequently, resource mobilisation through issuances of corporate bonds in the primary market declined by 15.9 per cent to _2,105 billion during October 2017-February 2018 from _2,502 billion during the same period of 2016-17 (Chart IV.13b). The share of financial entities in the resource mobilisation was 76 per cent during October 2017_February 2018. Almost the entire resource mobilisation from the corporate bond market (99.9 per cent) was by way of private placements. FPI in corporate bonds increased from _1.98 trillion at end- September 2017 to _2.24 trillion as on March 28, 2018, constituting 91.9 per cent of the approved limit for investment in corporate bonds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The surge in low cost current account and savings account (CASA) deposits into the banking system post demonetisation, coupled with the aggressive reduction in term deposit rates, aided the pass through of policy rate cuts to lending rates of commercial banks (Table IV.3). The speed of transmission gathered momentum from November 2016, with lending rates falling faster than term deposit rates. This also reflected the still subdued demand for credit and the availability of alternative non-bank sources of financing. The extent of reduction in lending rates on outstanding loans continued to be relatively small though, due to sticky interest rates on base-rate- linked loans and the 1-year reset period of MCLR-linked loans.Since January 2015 _ when the accommodative cycle of monetary policy commenced _ the median base rate has declined by 80 basis points (bps) as against the cumulative decline of 200 bps in the policy repo rate. Significantly, the pace of decline in the base rate slackened drastically after the introduction of the MCLR in April 2016. As the proportion of outstanding loans linked to the base rate (which were contracted during July 2010 _ March 2016) declined only gradually through 2016-17 and in 2017-18, the transmission of policy rate cuts to outstanding loans amounted to 55 bps during 2017-18 (up to February), albeit higher than 40 bps during 2016-17. As a result, the monthly median spread between the WALR and one-year MCLRs of individual banks declined after scaling a peak in January 2017 (Chart IV.25).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Equity and bond markets remain vulnerable to episodic bouts of volatility in a period of considerable uncertainty surrounding the evolution of global financial markets as well as around domestic developments which can impact market sentiment and liquidity conditions significantly, as the year gone by has shown. In the forex market, global developments _ particularly in the systemically important economies _ will continue to influence exchange rate developments, especially through the magnitude and direction of capital flows. Credit growth is accelerating and is also becoming broad-based, which bodes well for sustaining the pick-up in domestic economic activity that appears to have taken root since Q3. Going forward, liquidity conditions would be managed in a manner consistent with the Reserve Bank¡¯s policy stance of moving towards ex ante neutrality in order to facilitate closer alignment of the operating target of monetary policy _ the WACR _ with the policy repo rate. Issues in monetary transmission will continue to engage the Reserve Bank and market participants, and efforts will be carried forward towards bringing in greater transparency in the setting of interest rates by banks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Since the MPR of October 2017, global economic activity has gained strength, with growth impulses becoming synchronised across regions. Global trade has expanded, buoyed by gradually improving global demand and especially, the revival of investment activity in advanced economies (AEs). Crude prices have firmed up on strong demand and geo-political concerns, necessitating the drawdown of inventories even as production cuts by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) restrain supply. Metal prices have risen, fuelled by demandsupply imbalances and resurgent demand as economic prospects improve. Inflation has remained below target levels in most AEs despite the pick-up in aggregate demand and rise in some commodity prices, while it remains subdued in most emerging market economies (EMEs).International financial markets, which were buoyed by reflation trade and remained resilient to the normalisation of monetary policy by the US Fed during Q4:2017 and January 2018, turned volatile beginning the first week of February on (i) strong payrolls and accelerated wage growth data in the US fuelling expectations of faster tightening of monetary policy; (ii) announcement of protectionist trade measures by the US and retaliatory talk; and (iii) uncertainty surrounding the Brexit transition deal. Equity markets in advanced and emerging market economies, which had rallied in H2:2017, shed some of their gains in Q1:2018. Bond yields in major AEs hardened on expectations of faster monetary policy normalisation and rise in inflation in some AEs. The US dollar remained weak, while the euro and the yen appreciated. EME currencies behaved divergently with a general appreciating bias until January 2018.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The monetary policy stance has remained accommodative in many countries, with the Fed¡¯s policy normalisation progressing along expected lines. The US Fed raised its policy rate by 25 bps each in December 2017 and March 2018 meetings. The March 2018 projections of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants suggest that the Fed could hike the policy rate two more times in 2018. In contrast, the ECB has maintained its ultra-accommodative policy stance and kept its rates at a record low. The strong euro is weighing on inflation and keeping it below the target. The Bank of Japan has continued with its ultraaccommodative stance as inflation has remained well below the target (Chart V.7a).Monetary policy stances remained diverse in EMEs, with many central banks in key EMEs reducing policy rates. Central Bank of the Russian Federation cut rates thrice _ in December, February and March _ with inflation developments remaining favourable, while Brazil has been cutting rates aggressively on underwhelming inflation. South Africa cut its policy rate in March on subsiding inflation. The People¡¯s Bank of China has left its benchmark one-year lending and deposits rates unchanged since October 2015, preferring to influence borrowing costs through liquidity operations and inter-bank market rates. Among other EMEs, Indonesia has kept its policy rate unchanged since the rate cut effected in September 2017. Turkey kept its policy rate unchanged as inflation remained elevated. Mexico raised its policy rate twice in December and March on rising inflation concerns (Chart V.7b).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Although markets remained relatively calm and stable during most part of 2017 and January 2018 even in the wake of the unwinding of the Fed¡¯s balance sheet, financial markets turned volatile in February and went into swift correction on fears of faster rate hikes by the US Fed. Early March also witnessed the return of volatility on announcement of protectionist measures by the US and the momentary calm was shattered by intensification of trade protectionism between China and the US. The growing financial market integration in recent years has led to spillovers of volatility from AEs to EMEs due to monetary policy actions and financial events, as witnessed recently (Box V.1).Equity prices have risen across most AEs and EMEs on improving global growth prospects and still accommodative monetary policy stances (Chart V.8a). The Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) World Index increased by 3.9 per cent between October 2017 and March 2018. Equity markets, which had surged during Q4:2017 and January 2018, tanked due to sharp sell-offs across the globe during February on rising interest rate concerns in the US. Just when the equity market in the US began to recover with investors shrugging off fears of inflation worries, volatility returned in March on announcement of US trade policies. In the euro area, equity prices have remained under pressure, lagging behind most peers on expectations of lower corporate earnings and revenue due to a strong euro. Also negotiations surrounding Brexit and election in some member countries adversely impacted investor sentiment. In Japan, a rally in share prices during 2017 and early 2018 was driven by stronger economic performance, higher corporate earnings and lower corporate tax rates. In February, Japanese stock markets cooled during the global stock market sell-off, with the rising yen also slicing away some gains.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Sovereign bond yields in many AEs hardened with the 10-year US sovereign bond yield touching a four-year high in February on expectations of faster rate hikes by the Fed. Recent inward looking policies have also soured investor sentiment and impacted bond yields adversely. In the euro area, the benchmark 10-year German bond yield has risen, though weak inflation numbers in the euro area have exerted some downward pressure. In Japan, bond yields have been falling since February 2018, coming off from a multi-month high on Japan¡¯s yield curve control policy (Chart V.9a). Bond yields in EMEs were driven by country-specific factors, though they have risen recently in most countries on expectations of shrinking global liquidity and pick-up in inflation in the US.Currency markets have been driven mainly by monetary policy stances in the key AEs and macroeconomic data. The US dollar continued to depreciate and fell to a multi-year low in January on improving growth prospects in other regions. Weaker GDP data for Q4:2017 and comments by authorities in January in favour of a weaker dollar also weighed on the currency. In early March, however, the US dollar rose on upbeat views by the Fed on the US economy, but fell again on fears of intensification of trade wars. The euro is trading at its highest level in more than three years on narrowing of growth differentials between the euro area and its peers and the weakening of the US dollar. The Japanese yen touched the highest level against the US dollar since November 2016 on fears of a trade war.The MSCI Emerging Market Currency index hit a two-month high in January 2018 on the US dollar¡¯s weakness, rising commodity prices and a more synchronised growth upturn, along with ebbing political concerns in some of the constituents (Chart V.9b). Most Asian currencies have retreated in the wake of the recent stock market turmoil, global trade risks and the upbeat US economic outlook, though investors continue to discriminate on countryspecific factors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Since the MPC¡¯s last meeting in December 2017, global economic activity has gained further pace with growth impulses becoming more synchronised across regions. Among advanced economies (AEs), the Euro area expanded at a robust pace, supported by consumption and investment. Economic optimism alongside falling unemployment and low interest rates are supporting the recovery. The US economy lost some momentum with growth slowing down in Q4 of 2017 even as manufacturing activity touched a multi-month high in December. The Japanese economy continued to grow as manufacturing activity gathered pace in January on strong external demand, providing fillip to the already bullish business confidence.Economic activity accelerated in emerging market economies (EMEs) in the final quarter of 2017. The Chinese economy grew above the official target, driven by strong domestic consumption and robust exports. However, some downside risks to growth remain, especially from easing fixed asset investment and surging debt levels. In Russia, strong private consumption, rising oil prices and high exports are supporting economic activity, although weak investment and economic sanctions are weighing on its growth prospects. In Brazil, data on household spending and unemployment were positive in Q4. However, recovery remains vulnerable to political uncertainty, which has dampened consumer confidence. South Africa continues to face challenges on both domestic and external fronts, including high unemployment and declining factory activity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Global trade continued to expand, underpinned by strong investment and robust manufacturing activity. Crude oil prices touched a three-year high as production cuts by the OPEC coupled with falling inventories weighed on the global demand-supply balance. Bullion prices touched a multi-month high on a weak US dollar. Inflation remained contained in most AEs, barring the UK, on subdued wage pressures. Inflation was divergent in key EMEs due to country-specific factors.Financial markets have become volatile in recent days due to uncertainty over the pace of normalisation of the US Fed monetary policy in view of January payrolls data showing rapidly accelerating wage growth and better than expected employment. The volatility index (VIX) has climbed to its highest level since Brexit. Equity markets have witnessed a sharp correction, both in AEs and EMEs. Bond yields in the US have hardened sharply, adding to the upward pressures seen during January, with concomitant rise in bond yields in other AEs and EMEs. Forex markets have become volatile as well. Until this episode of recent volatility, global financial markets were buoyed by investor appetite for risk, corporate tax cuts by the US, and stable economic conditions. Equity markets had gained significantly in January, driven by robust Chinese growth, uptick in commodity prices, and positive corporate sentiment in general. In currency markets, the US dollar had touched a multi-month low on February 1 on fiscal risks and improving growth prospects in other AEs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"On the domestic front, the real gross value added (GVA) growth as per the first advance estimates (FAE) released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) is estimated to decelerate to 6.1 per cent in 2017-18 from 7.1 per cent in 2016-17 due mainly to slowdown in agriculture and allied activities, mining and quarrying, manufacturing, and public administration and defence (PADO) services.Information available after the release of FAE by the CSO has, however, been generally positive. Manufacturing output boosted the growth of index of industrial production (IIP) in November. After a period of prolonged weakness, cement production registered robust growth in November-December, which along with continuing healthy growth in steel production led to acceleration of infrastructure goods production in November. The manufacturing purchasing managers¡¯ index (PMI) expanded for the sixth consecutive month in January led by new orders. Assessment of overall business sentiment in the Indian manufacturing sector improved in Q3 as reflected in the Reserve Bank¡¯s Industrial Outlook Survey (IOS). However, core sector growth decelerated in December due to contraction/deceleration in production of coal, crude oil, steel and electricity. Acreage in the case of wheat, oilseeds and coarse cereals was lower than last year. As a result, the shortfall in area sown for rabi crops increased to (-)1.5 per cent as on February 2 as compared with (-)1.0 per cent on December 29, 2017.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"In the services sector, some of the high frequency indicators improved. Commercial vehicle sales growth touched an eight-year high in December. Cargo carried by sea, rail and air also registered higher growth in November, but showed mixed performance in December. Other indicators such as domestic and international air passenger traffic and foreign tourist arrivals grew at a fast pace in November-December. The services PMI expanded sequentially in December and January on the back of higher business activity.Retail inflation, measured by the year-on-year change in the consumer price index (CPI), increased for the sixth consecutive month in December on account of a strong unfavourable base effect. After rising abruptly in November, food prices reversed partly in December, reflecting mainly the seasonal moderation, albeit muted, in prices of vegetables along with continuing decline in prices of pulses. Cereals inflation moderated with prices remaining steady in December. However, inflation in some components of food _ eggs; meat and fish; oils and fats; and milk _ increased. Fuel and light group inflation, which showed a sharp increase in November, softened somewhat in December, driven by moderation in electricity, LPG and kerosene inflation.CPI inflation excluding food and fuel increased further in November and December, largely on account of increase in housing inflation following the implementation of higher house rent allowances (HRA) for government employees under the 7th central pay commission (CPC) award. Inflation also picked up in health and personal care and effects. Reflecting incomplete pass-through to domestic petroleum product prices, inflation in transport and communication remained muted in December. Inflation also slowed down in clothing and footwear, household goods and services, recreation, and education.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Households¡¯ inflation expectations, measured by the Reserve Bank¡¯s survey of households, remained elevated for both three-month ahead and one-year ahead horizons even as inflation expectation for one-year ahead horizon moderated marginally. Firms responding to the Reserve Bank¡¯s Industrial Outlook Survey (IOS) continued to report input price pressures and increase in selling prices in Q3. This is also confirmed by manufacturing and services firms polled by PMI. Organised sector wage growth remained firm, while the rural wage growth decelerated.The liquidity in the system continues to be in surplus mode, but it is moving steadily towards neutrality. The weighted average call rate (WACR) traded 12 basis points (bps) below the repo rate during December-January as against 15 bps below the repo rate in November. On some days in December and January, the system turned into deficit due to slow down in government spending and large tax collections, which necessitated injection of liquidity by the Reserve Bank. During the two weeks beginning December 16, 2017, the Reserve Bank injected average daily net liquidity of _ 388 billion into the system. For December as a whole, however, the Reserve Bank absorbed _ 316 billion (on a net daily average basis). As the system turned into deficit again in the fourth week of January, the Reserve Bank injected average net liquidity of _ 145 billion. For January, on the whole, the Reserve Bank absorbed _ 353 billion (on a net daily average basis).Merchandise exports bounced back in November and December. While petroleum products, engineering goods and chemicals accounted for three-fourths of this growth, exports of readymade garments contracted. During the same period, merchandise import growth accelerated sequentially with over one-third of the growth emanating from petroleum (crude and products) due largely to high international prices. Gold imports increased _ both in value and volume terms _ in December, after declining in the preceding three months. Pearls and precious stones, electronic goods and coal were major contributors to non-oil non-gold import growth. With import growth exceeding export growth, the trade deficit for December was US$ 14.9 billion.Even though the current account deficit narrowed sharply in Q2 of 2017-18 on a sequential basis, it was higher than its level a year ago, mainly due to widening of the trade deficit. While net foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows moderated in April-October 2017 from their level a year ago, net foreign portfolio investment (FPI) inflows were buoyant in 2017-18 (up to February 1). India¡¯s foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 421.9 billion on February 2, 2018",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The December bi-monthly resolution projected inflation in the range of 4.3-4.7 per cent in the second half of 2017-18, including the impact of increase in HRA. In terms of actual outcomes, headline inflation averaged 4.6 per cent in Q3, driven primarily by an unusual pick-up in food prices in November. Though prices eased in December, the winter seasonal food price moderation was less than usual. Domestic pump prices of petrol and diesel rose sharply in January, reflecting lagged pass-through of the past increases in international crude oil prices. Considering these factors, inflation is now estimated at 5.1 per cent in Q4, including the HRA impact.The inflation outlook beyond the current year is likely to be shaped by several factors. First, international crude oil prices have firmed up sharply since August 2017, driven by both demand and supply side factors. Second, non-oil industrial raw material prices have also witnessed a global uptick. Firms polled in the Reserve Bank¡¯s IOS expect input prices to harden in Q4. In a scenario of improving economic activity, rising input costs are likely to be passed on to consumers. Third, the inflation outlook will depend on the monsoon, which is assumed to be normal. Taking these factors into consideration, CPI inflation for 2018-19 is estimated in the range of 5.1-5.6 per cent in H1, including diminishing statistical HRA impact of central government employees, and 4.5-4.6 per cent in H2, with risks tilted to the upside (Chart 1). The projected moderation in inflation in the second half is on account of strong favourable base effects, including unwinding of the 7th CPC¡¯s HRA impact, and a softer food inflation forecast, given the assumption of normal monsoon and effective supply management by the Government.Turning to the growth outlook, GVA growth for 2017-18 is projected at 6.6 per cent. Beyond the current year, the growth outlook will be influenced by several factors. First, GST implementation is stabilising, which augurs well for economic activity. Second, there are early signs of revival in investment activity as reflected in improving credit offtake, large resource mobilisation from the primary capital market, and improving capital goods production and imports. Third, the process of recapitalisation of public sector banks has got underway. Large distressed borrowers are being referenced for resolution under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). This should improve credit flows further and create demand for fresh investment. Fourth, although export growth is expected to improve further on account of improving global demand, elevated commodity prices, especially of oil, may act as a drag on aggregate demand. Taking into consideration the above factors, GVA growth for 2018-19 is projected at 7.2 per cent overall _ in the range of 7.3-7.4 per cent in H1 and 7.1-7.2 per cent in H2 _ with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The MPC notes that the inflation outlook is clouded by several uncertainties on the upside. First, the staggered impact of HRA increases by various state governments may push up headline inflation further over the baseline in 2018-19, and potentially induce second-round effects. Second, a pick-up in global growth may exert further pressure on crude oil and commodity prices with implications for domestic inflation. Third, the Union Budget 2018-19 has proposed revised guidelines for arriving at the minimum support prices (MSPs) for kharif crops, although the exact magnitude of its impact on inflation cannot be fully assessed at this stage. Fourth, the Union Budget has also proposed an increase in customs duty on a number of items. Fifth, fiscal slippage as indicated in the Union Budget could impinge on the inflation outlook. Apart from the direct impact on inflation, fiscal slippage has broader macro-financial implications, notably on economy-wide costs of borrowing which have already started to rise. This may feed into inflation. Sixth, the confluence of domestic fiscal developments and normalisation of monetary policy by major advanced economies could further adversely impact financing conditions and undermine the confidence of external investors. There is, therefore, need for vigilance around the evolving inflation scenario in the coming months. There are also mitigating factors. First, capacity utilisation remains subdued. Second, oil prices have moved both ways in the recent period and can potentially soften from current levels based on production response. Third, rural real wage growth is moderate.Accordingly, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate on hold and continue with the neutral stance. The MPC reiterates its commitment to keep headline inflation close to 4 per cent on a durable basis.The MPC notes that the economy is on a recovery path, including early signs of a revival of investment activity. Global demand is improving, which should help strengthen domestic investment activity. The focus of the Union Budget on the rural and infrastructure sectors is also a welcome development as it would support rural incomes and investment, and in turn provide a further push to aggregate demand and economic activity. On the downside, the deterioration in public finances risks crowding out of private financing and investment. The Committee is of the view that the nascent recovery needs to be carefully nurtured and growth put on a sustainably higher path through conducive and stable macro-financial management.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Since the last meeting of the MPC in October 2017, global economic activity has been gaining momentum through the final quarter of the year, driven mainly by advanced economies (AEs). US growth remained largely resilient to hurricanes and grew at the highest pace in the past three years in Q3 of 2017, with positive contributions from private consumption, investment activity and net exports. The unemployment rate fell to 4.1 per cent in October, the lowest in the last 17 years. In the Euro area, economic activity expanded, underpinned by accommodative monetary policy and strong job gains. The Japanese economy also continued to grow in Q3, largely supported by external demand, which helped compensate for the slowing of domestic consumption.Among major emerging market economies (EMEs), the services sector remained the main driver of growth in China in Q3. However, weakness in real estate and construction activity remained a drag on growth. In Brazil, incoming data suggest that the recovery gained further momentum in Q3, with unemployment touching an intra-year low in September. Business and consumer confidence rose in October. Economic activity in Russia moderated in Q3 due to weakness in industrial production. The South African economy continued to face headwinds from weak manufacturing activity, elevated levels of unemployment and political instability.The latest assessment by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) for Q4 indicates a loss of momentum in global trade due to declining export orders. Crude oil prices touched a two-and-a-half-year high in early November on account of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries¡¯ (OPEC) efforts to rebalance the market. Bullion prices have been under some selling pressure on account of the rising US dollar. Weak non-oil commodity prices and subdued wage dynamics have kept inflation contained in many AEs, while the inflation scenario remains diverse in major EMEs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Global financial markets have remained buoyant, reflecting the improving economic outlook and the gradual normalisation of monetary policy by the US Fed. Equity markets have gained on improved corporate earnings and anticipation of large tax cuts in the US. Although equity markets have made gains in EMEs in general, they faced risk aversion in some economies. While bond yields in most AEs have moved sideways in the absence of inflation pressures, they have risen across most EMEs on country-specific factors. In currency markets, the US dollar has gained, while the surge in the euro on positive economic data lost some momentum in November due to political uncertainty. Several emerging market currencies weakened due to domestic factors. Capital inflows to EMEs have been differentiating among countries, based on investor perceptions of risk-return trade-offs.On the domestic front, the growth of real gross value added (GVA) accelerated sequentially in Q2 of 2017-18, after five consecutive quarters of deceleration. It was powered by a sharp acceleration in industrial activity. All the three sub-sectors of industry registered higher growth. GVA growth in the manufacturing sector _ the key component of industry _ accelerated sharply on improved demand and re-stocking post goods and services tax (GST) implementation. The mining sector expanded in Q2 due to higher coal and natural gas production. GVA growth in the electricity, gas, water supply and other utility services sector also strengthened on higher demand. In contrast, growth in agriculture and allied activities slackened, reflecting the lower than expected kharif harvest. Activity in the services sector decelerated, mainly on account of slowdown in financial, insurance, real estate and professional services, and in public administration, defence and other services (PADO) following the large front-loading of government expenditure in Q1. Despite some improvement, construction sector growth remained tepid due to transitory effects of the RERA and GST implementation. Growth in the trade, hotels, transport and communication sub-group remained resilient, in spite of some slowdown in growth in Q2 as compared with the previous quarter. On the expenditure side, the growth of gross fixed capital formation improved for the second successive quarter. However, growth in private final consumption expenditure _ the mainstay of aggregate demand _ slowed to an eight-quarter low in Q2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Looking beyond Q2, rabi sowing in Q3 has so far been marginally lagging behind the acreage sown during the comparable period of the previous year. Precipitation since October has remained at around 13 per cent below the long period average (LPA). Major reservoirs, the main source of irrigation during the rabi season, were at 64 per cent of the full reservoir level vis-a-vis 67 per cent in the previous year. On the positive side, pulses sowing increased significantly as compared with a year ago, partly reflecting the impact of lifting of the export ban for all varieties of pulses. Available high-frequency indicators suggest a mixed picture of industrial activity for Q3. Core industries¡¯ growth was flat in October as all constituents barring steel and fertilisers slowed down sequentially. Coal mining, which revived strongly in Q2, slowed down too, while cement production contracted. In contrast, the Purchasing Managers¡¯ Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which fell in October, rebounded in November, driven by output and new orders. Also, according to the Reserve Bank¡¯s Industrial Outlook Survey (IOS), production is expected to pick up in Q3 as order books are rising.Services sector activity has remained mixed in October. In the transportation sector, sales of commercial vehicles decelerated; those of passenger vehicles and two-wheeler turned into contraction mode. By contrast, domestic and international air passenger and freight traffic, and railway freight expanded robustly. The Reserve Bank¡¯s survey suggests that sentiments on service sector activity for Q3 are upbeat and auto sales have rebounded in November. On the other hand, PMI for services moved into contraction zone in November.Retail inflation measured by year-on-year change in the consumer price index (CPI) recorded a seven-month high in October, driven by a sharp uptick in momentum, tempered partly by some favourable base effects. Food inflation was volatile in the last two months _ declining sharply in September and bouncing back in October _ due mainly to vegetables and fruits. Milk and eggs inflation has shown an uptick, while pulses inflation remained negative for the eleventh successive month in October. Cereal inflation remained stable. Fuel group inflation, which has been on an upward trajectory since July, accelerated further due to a sharp pick-up in inflation in liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), kerosene, coke and electricity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"CPI inflation excluding food and fuel, which increased from July to September, remained steady in October. This reflected the softening of petroleum product prices on account of the reversal of taxes on petroleum products by the central and state governments. However, there was a hardening of housing inflation following the implementation of higher house rent allowances for central government employees under the 7th central pay commission award.The Reserve Bank¡¯s survey of households showed inflation expectations firming up in the latest round for both three months ahead and one year ahead horizons. Farm and industrial raw material costs rose in October. Firms responding to the Reserve Bank¡¯s Industrial Outlook Survey expect to pass on the increase in input prices to their output prices. Turning to other costs, wage growth in the organised sector edged up, while rural wage growth weakened, particularly in agriculture.Surplus liquidity in the system has continued to decline during October and November. Currency in circulation increased by _ 736 billion in Q3 (up to December 1, 2017) over end-September on festival demand. The Reserve Bank managed surplus liquidity through the conduct of regular variable rate reverse repo auctions of various tenors, ranging from overnight to 28 days. Net average daily absorption of liquidity under the LAF declined from _ 2,229 billion in September to _ 1,400 billion in October 2017 and further to _ 718 billion in November. The Reserve Bank conducted open market sales of _ 300 billion in October-November, taking the total absorption of durable liquidity during the financial year so far to _ 1.9 trillion, comprising _ 900 billion in the form of open market sales and _ 1 trillion of long-term treasury bills under the market stabilisation scheme. The weighted average call rate (WACR) traded 12 bps and 15 bps below the repo rate during October and November, respectively, as against 13 bps in September.Merchandise exports declined by 1.1 per cent in October 2017 after showing positive growth for 14 consecutive months. A sustained increase in exports of engineering goods, petroleum products and chemicals during the month was outweighed by a sharp fall in shipments of gems and jewellery, ready-made garments, and drugs and pharmaceuticals. Imports continued to expand, though at a modest pace. Although gold imports rose sequentially in October, they moderated from their level a year ago. Consequently, the trade deficit widened again in October. Despite moderation in September, net foreign direct investment in H1 of 2017-18 was at the same level as a year ago. With the announcement of the recapitalisation plan for public sector banks, foreign portfolio inflows into equities resumed sharply in October, after recording outflows in the preceding month. India¡¯s foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 401.94 billion on November 30, 2017.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The October bi-monthly statement projected inflation to rise and range between 4.2-4.6 per cent in the second half of this year, including the impact of increase in house rent allowance (HRA) by the Centre. The headline inflation outcomes have evolved broadly in line with projections. Going forward, the inflation path will be influenced by several factors. First, moderation in inflation excluding food and fuel observed in Q1 of 2017-18 has, by and large, reversed. There is a risk that this upward trajectory may continue in the near-term. Second, the impact of HRA by the Central Government is expected to peak in December. The staggered impact of HRA increases by various state governments may push up housing inflation further in 2018, with attendant second order effects. Third, the recent rise in international crude oil prices may sustain, especially on account of the OPEC¡¯s decision to maintain production cuts through next year. In such a scenario, any adverse supply shock due to geo-political developments could push up prices even further. Despite recent increase in prices of vegetables, some seasonal moderation is expected in near months as winter arrivals kick in. Prices of pulses have continued to show a downward bias. The GST Council in its last meeting has brought several retail goods and services to lower tax brackets, which should translate into lower retail prices, going forward. On the whole, inflation is estimated in the range 4.3-4.7 per cent in Q3 and Q4 of this year, including the HRA effect of up to 35 basis points, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 1).Turning to GVA projections, Q2 growth was lower than that projected in the October resolution. The recent increase in oil prices may have a negative impact on margins of firms and GVA growth. Shortfalls in kharif production and rabi sowing pose downside risks to the outlook for agriculture. On the positive side, there has been some pick up in credit growth in recent months. Recapitalisation of public sector banks may help improve credit flows further. While there has been weakness in some components of the services sector such as real estate, the Reserve Bank¡¯s survey indicates that the services and infrastructure sectors are expecting an improvement in demand, financial conditions and the overall business situation in Q4. Taking into account the above factors, the projection of real GVA growth for 2017-18 of the October resolution at 6.7 per cent has been retained, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The MPC notes that the evolving trajectory needs to be carefully monitored. First, two of the key factors determining the cost of living conditions and inflation expectations, i.e., food and fuel inflation, edged up in November. Inflation expectations of households surveyed by the Reserve Bank have already firmed up and any increase in food and fuel prices may further harden these expectations. Second, rising input cost conditions as reflected in various surveys point towards higher risk of pass-through to retail prices in the near term. Third, implementation of farm loan waivers by select states, partial roll back of excise duty and VAT in the case of petroleum products, and decrease in revenue on account of reduction in GST rates for several goods and services may result in fiscal slippage with attendant implications for inflation. Fourth, global financial instability on account of the pace of/uncertainty over monetary policy normalisation in AEs and fiscal expansion in the US carry risks for inflation. The expected seasonal moderation in prices of vegetables, and fruits and the recent lowering of tax rates by the GST Council could mitigate upside pressures. Accordingly, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate on hold. However, keeping in mind the output gap dynamics, the MPC decided to continue with the neutral stance and watch the incoming data carefully. The MPC remains committed to keeping headline inflation close to 4 per cent on a durable basis. In the MPC¡¯s assessment, there have been several significant developments in the recent period which augur well for growth prospects, going forward. First, capital raised from the primary capital market has increased significantly after several years of sluggish activity. As the capital raised is deployed to set up new projects, it will add to demand in the short run and boost the growth potential of the economy over the medium-term. Second, the improvement in the ease of doing business ranking should help sustain foreign direct investment in the economy. Third, large distressed borrowers are being referenced to the insolvency and bankruptcy code (IBC) and public sector banks are being recapitalised, which should enhance allocative efficiency. However, the MPC notes that the impact of these factors can be buttressed by reducing the cost of domestic borrowings through improved transmission by banks of past monetary policy changes on outstanding loans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Since the April 2017 meeting of the MPC, global economic activity has expanded at a modest pace, supported by firming growth in major advanced economies (AEs) and in some emerging market economies (EMEs) as well. In the US, a tightening labour market is generating wage gains. Alongside, industrial production has steadily improved in recent months and retail sales remain robust, although home sales ebbed in April. Political risks remain high, however. In the Euro area, the recovery has been underpinned by consistently falling unemployment, rising retail sales and a brighter outlook for manufacturing reflected in purchasing managers¡¯ and business surveys. In Japan, exports supported by a depreciated yen and industrial activity are driving an acceleration in growth. Wages and inflation, however, are depressed and holding back domestic demand. Among EMEs, the Chinese economy is stabilising, especially in manufacturing, but financial risks in the form of the credit-fuelled debt overhang could impinge on the outlook. Brazil appears to be emerging out of recession, although growth dynamics remain fragile due to worsening labour market conditions and political turmoil. In Russia, the strengthening global environment is supporting the recovery with improving macro fundamentals. South Africa is grappling with structural constraints which are depressing economic activity.The pick-up in global merchandise trade volume since the start of the year has been sustained in Q2 of 2017, buoyed by strengthening global demand as reflected in rising international air freight and container throughput. Crude prices fell to a five-month low in early May on higher output from Canada and the US, and remain soft, undermining the OPEC¡¯s recent efforts to tighten the market by trimming supply. Among non-fuel commodity prices, metal prices have been retreating on expectations of weak demand from China. Bullion prices remain range-bound, while food prices eased in April but rose in May. These developments suggest that the inflation outlook is still relatively benign for AEs and EMEs alike.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"International financial markets have been lifted by improving global growth prospects, broadly accommodative monetary policy stances of systemic central banks and generally positive incoming data. Increasingly, financial markets have shown resilience to geo-political events and have swiftly priced them in. This has been reflected in the reinvigoration of the reach for returns. Country-specific factors have modulated investor sentiment. Equity markets in most AEs have gained in Q2, surpassing past peaks in the US; boosted by corporate profits in Japan; and supported by easing political tensions and upbeat data in the case of the Euro area. In EMEs, equities have turned in a mixed performance, with high valuations across Asia, but weaker in Latin America on softer commodity prices. Bond yields in major AEs have been largely range-bound. In EMEs, yields have hardened in the few countries facing inflation pressures and political uncertainties, but for commodity exporters, there has been some recent decline. In the currency markets, the US dollar has weakened in May after dovish guidance by the Fed and unexpected political events. Since mid-May, the yen has shed its depreciating bias and appears to have gained safe haven appeal. EME currencies, which had depreciated on the strength of the US dollar, have steadied more recently on renewal of capital flows and risk-on investor appetite.On May 31, 2017 India¡¯s Central Statistics Office (CSO) released quarterly estimates of national income accounts for Q4 of 2016-17, provisional estimates for 2016-17 and revisions for the preceding five years. The growth of real gross value added (GVA) for 2016-17 has been pegged at 6.6 per cent, 0.1 percentage point lower than the second advance estimates released in February 2017. Underlying the revision is a downward adjustment in services sector growth in Q4 for the constituents of construction, financial and professional services, and real estate. Estimates of agriculture and allied activities have been upgraded to incorporate the all-time high production of foodgrains and horticulture in the year. GVA in industry has also been placed higher in the provisional estimates relative to the earlier reading to reflect the impact of new indices of industrial production (IIP) and wholesale prices (WPI) rebased to 2011-12. The new data reveal that a slowdown in activity in both industry and services set in as early as Q1 of 2016-17 and became pronounced in Q4. Moreover, the deceleration of activity coursing through the year has had underlying drivers that have been in operation since Q2. Components of aggregate demand reflect a contraction in gross fixed investment in Q4, reversing the turnaround evident in the second half of the year in the advance estimates. This is also reflected in the contraction in the production of capital goods in the new IIP. However, private final consumption expenditure recorded robust year-on-year growth.On May 9, the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) released its third advance estimates of foodgrains production, which confirmed the record level of output achieved in 2016-17 and, in fact, revised it upwards to 273 million tonnes. The MoA also set out its second advance estimates of fruits and vegetables on May 30, which was also a historical record. Benefiting from the bumper harvest, rabi procurement during Q1 of 2017-18 so far has been significantly higher than a year ago, replenishing food stocks and taking them to 61.9 million tonnes in May 2017, three times the buffer norm. On June 6, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) re-affirmed its forecast of a normal and well-distributed south-west (June-September) monsoon, which augurs well for the agricultural outlook.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The new series on the IIP released by the CSO on May 12 improves the coverage of industrial activity, realigns weights and reclassifies sub-sectors to better capture the underlying structural dynamics of the sector, and smoothens the impact of lumpy items on the index. As a result, industrial production expanded by 5.0 per cent during 2016-17 based on the new series (as against 0.7 per cent in the old series). Turning to the current financial year, the output of eight core industries decelerated sharply in April on account of contraction in coal, crude oil and cement due to structural constraints and low demand. Furthermore, electricity generation decelerated due to depressed demand pricing out relatively expensive thermal output. By contrast, the production of steel and fertiliser picked up, the former driven up by exports and the latter by expectations of a normal monsoon.The business expectations index generated by the Reserve Bank¡¯s April round of the Industrial Outlook Survey reflects optimism in the manufacturing sector in Q2 of 2017-18, driven by expectations of rising rural demand, exports and profit margins. On the other hand, the manufacturing purchasing managers¡¯ index (PMI) moderated sequentially in May as employment contracted and new orders, both domestic and exports, slowed down. The index, however, remained in the expansion zone and the future output index accelerated for the third month in succession.High frequency real indicators of activity in the services sector point to a mixed performance in April. In the transportation sub-sector, freight carriage by air and rail gathered momentum, and passenger car sales accelerated on the back of sustained strength of urban demand. Sales of commercial vehicles and three-wheelers contracted, however, reflecting in part the effects of new emission norms and technology changes. Two-wheeler sales remained depressed, indicative of still subdued rural demand. In the communication sub-sector, there was a strong growth in the subscriber base of voice and data services. The sustained growth of foreign tourist arrivals and air passenger traffic, both domestic and international, supported activity in the hotels, restaurants and the hospitality sub-sector. Both steel consumption and cement production were, however, sluggish, pointing to continuing weakness in construction activity. The services PMI for May rose to its highest reading since November 2016, with an expansion in new business reflecting improving underlying demand conditions, alongside optimism on employme",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Retail inflation measured by year-on-year changes in the consumer price index (CPI) plunged to a historic low in April, pulled down by a large favourable base effect which overwhelmed a momentum that was feeble relative to the historical record for the month. Underlying this surprising softness was a sharp fall in food inflation brought about by a deflation in the prices of pulses and vegetables. In addition, moderation in the prices of cereals, eggs, oils and fats and spices contributed to the loss of momentum. In the case of pulses, the large-scale augmentation of supply on account of expansion in acreage, procurement, buffer stocking and imports caused a sharp decline in prices starting in August 2016. Propelled by significantly higher arrivals in mandis relative to the seasonal pattern, prices of vegetables also fell markedly from July and bottomed out in January 2017, with fire sales during the demonetisation period accentuating the fall. The seasonal uptick that typically occurs in the pre-monsoon months has been muted so far. In the fuel group by contrast, inflation surged across the board. Prices of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and kerosene rose in sympathy with international prices even as the subsidy was set on a path of calibrated reduction. Fuel used by rural households rose for the third month in succession, narrowing the wedge between fuel inflation facing rural and urban households. In response to these developments, inflation expectations three months ahead and a year ahead surveyed in the Reserve Bank¡¯s inflation expectations survey of households have ticked down marginally.Excluding food and fuel, inflation dipped 60 basis points from a month ago to 4.4 per cent. The delayed and cumulative downward adjustment of domestic petrol and diesel prices in April to the softening of international crude prices in preceding months was among the factors at work. Inflation in respect of services embedded in transport and communication, education, recreation and health also moderated. The industrial outlook survey and the PMIs for manufacturing and services indicate that pricing power remains weak.Even as surplus liquidity in the banking system post-demonetisation was drained by the ramping up of new currency in circulation by _ 1.5 trillion in April and May, massive spending by the Government re-injected liquidity into the system, raising the daily average overall surplus liquidity in the banking system to _ 4.2 trillion in April and _ 3.5 trillion in May. Unwinding of the excess reserves that banks used to dress up balance sheets for end-March also resulted in an accretion of _ 0.8 trillion to the surplus liquidity. Absorption operations undertaken by the Reserve Bank in the context of these developments and the consequent downward pressure on money market rates consisted of _ 1 trillion impounded through issuance of treasury bills (TBs) of tenors ranging from 312 days to 329 days under the market stabilisation scheme (MSS), auctions of cash management bills (CMBs) of _ 0.7 trillion triggered by the decline in cash balances of the Government, and variable rate reverse repo auctions of different tenors which took in the remaining surplus liquidity averaging _ 3.8 trillion in April and _ 3.4 trillion in May. With the narrowing of the the LAF corridor from +/- 50 bps to +/- 25 bps in April 2017, these operations ensured that the weighted average call money rate (WACR) _ the operating target of monetary policy_ broadly traded within the corridor. The spread between the WACR and the policy repo rate narrowed from 29-32 basis points (bps) in March-April to 21 bps in May.Merchandise exports posted double digit growth in March and April 2017 in an environment of slowly improving global trade, with 80 per cent of this expansion contributed by engineering goods, petroleum products, gems and jewellery, readymade garments and chemicals. Merchandise imports also increased sharply, propelled by domestic demand, with the jump of 47.2 per cent in US dollar terms not recorded since 2011. Imports of petroleum and products rose strongly on price effects as international crude prices firmed up in the wake of OPEC¡¯s productions cut. Gold imports also surged in volume terms, initially driven by seasonal and festival demand but subsequently by stockpiling in anticipation of the roll out of the goods and services tax (GST). Non-oil non-gold imports contributed about half of the total import growth in March and April, reflecting higher recourse to electronic goods, pearls and precious stones, coal, machinery and machine tools from overseas markets. With import growth significantly outpacing export growth, the trade deficit increased sizably. The current account deficit (CAD) for the year 2016-17 is likely to remain within 1 per cent of GDP. Unlike in the immediately preceding quarter, capital flows in April-May 2017 were dominated by foreign portfolio investment (FPI), pushed out by risk-on investor sentiment as global growth prospects improved. Also, clarity emerged on taxation issues in the Union Budget and the expectations of faster structural reforms were fuelled by the decisive outcome of State elections. The level of foreign exchange reserves as on June 2, 2017 was US$ 381.2 billion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The abrupt and significant retreat of inflation in April from the firming trajectory that was developing in February and March has raised several issues that have to be factored into the inflation projections. First, it needs to be assessed as to whether or not the unusually low momentum in the reading for April will endure. Second, the prices of pulses are clearly reeling under the impact of a supply glut caused by record output and imports. Policy interventions, including access to open trade, may be envisaged to arrest the slump in prices. Third, the accumulated downward adjustment in the prices of petrol and diesel effected in April has been largely reversed on June 1. Fourth, the easing of inflation excluding food and fuel may be transient in view of its underlying stickiness in a situation of rising rural wage growth and strong consumption demand. Thus, the April reading has imparted considerable uncertainty to the evolving inflation trajectory, especially for the near months. If the configurations evident in April are sustained, then absent policy interventions, headline inflation is projected in the range of 2.0-3.5 per cent in the first half of the year and 3.5-4.5 per cent in the second half (Chart 1). Risks are evenly balanced, although the spatial and temporal distribution of the monsoon and the government staying the course in effective food management will play a critical role in the evolution of risks. The risk of fiscal slippages, which, by and large, can entail inflationary spillovers, has risen with the announcements of large farm loan waivers. At the current juncture, global political and financial risks materialising into imported inflation and the disbursement of allowances under the 7th central pay commission¡¯s award are upside risks. The date of implementation of the latter is still not announced and as such, it is not factored into the baseline projections. The implementation of the GST is not expected to have a material impact on overall inflation.With the CSO¡¯s provisional estimates for 2016-17, the projection of real GVA growth for 2017-18 has accordingly been revised 10 bps downwards from the April 2017 projection to 7.3 per cent, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2). The continuing remonetisation should enable a pick-up in discretionary consumer spending, especially in cash-intensive segments of the economy. Furthermore, the reductions in banks¡¯ lending rates post-demonetisation should support both consumption and investment demand of households and stress-free corporates. Moreover, Government spending continues to be robust, cushioning the impact of a slowdown in other constituents. The implementation of proposals in the Union Budget should crowd in private investment as the business environment improves with structural reforms, including the GST, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, and the abolition of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board. Strengthening external demand will likely play a more decisive role in supporting the domestic economy. In addition, the new IIP broadens the recognition of industrial activity. On the downside, global political risks remain elevated and could materialise. Second, rising input costs and wage pressures may prove a drag on the profitability of firms, pulling down overall GVA growth. Third, the twin balance sheet problem - over-leveraged corporate sector and stressed banking sector - may delay the revival in private investment demand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The MPC noted that incoming data suggest that the transitory effects of demonetisation have lingered on in price formations relating to salient food items, entangled with excess supply conditions with respect to fruits and vegetables, pulses and cereals. At the same time, however, the CSO¡¯s latest releases on national income accounts and industrial production attest to the effects of demonetisation on the broader economy being sector specific and transient, as well as to the noteworthy resilience of private consumption. At this stage, it is difficult to isolate these factors or to judge the strength of their persistence. As the year progresses, underlying inflation pressures, especially input costs, wages and imported inflation, will have to be closely and continuously monitored.Noting that inflation has fallen below 4 per cent only since November 2016, the MPC remains focused on its commitment to keeping headline inflation close to 4 per cent on a durable basis keeping in mind the output gap. The current state of the economy underscores the need to revive private investment, restore banking sector health and remove infrastructural bottlenecks. Monetary policy can play a more effective role only when these factors are in place. Premature action at this stage risks disruptive policy reversals later and the loss of credibility. Accordingly, the MPC decided to keep the policy rate unchanged with a neutral stance and remain watchful of incoming data.The Reserve Bank will continue to work in partnership with the government to address the stress in banks¡¯ balance sheets. Better alignment of administered interest rates on small savings with market rates and stepped-up recapitalisation of banks to facilitate adequate flow of credit to productive sectors are important steps to follow through.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Since the MPC met in February 2017, indicators of global growth suggest signs of stronger activity in most advanced economies (AEs) and easing of recessionary conditions in commodity exporting large emerging market economies (EMEs). In the US, high frequency data indicate that the labour market, industrial production and retail sales are catalysing a recovery in Q1 of 2017 from a relatively subdued performance in the preceding quarter. Nonetheless, risks to higher growth have arisen from non-realisation or under-achievement of macroeconomic policies. In the Euro area, the manufacturing purchasing managers¡¯ index (PMI) rose to a six-year high in March amidst improving consumer confidence and steadily strengthening employment conditions. In the Japanese economy, nascent signs of revival are evident in the form of falling unemployment, improving business sentiment on fixed investment, and rising exports helped by the depreciation of the yen; however, deflation risks linger.For EMEs, the outlook is gradually improving, with indications that the slowdown characterising 2016 could be bottoming out. In China, supportive macroeconomic policies, surging credit growth and a booming property market have held up the momentum of growth albeit amidst concerns about financial stability and capital outflows. In Brazil, hardening commodity prices are providing tailwinds to reforms undertaken by the authorities to pull the economy out of recession, although financial fragilities remain a risk. Russia is benefiting from the firming up of crude prices and it is widely expected that growth will return to positive territory in 2017.Inflation is edging up in AEs to or above target levels on the back of slowly diminishing slack, tighter labour markets and rising commodity prices. Among EMEs, Turkey and South Africa remain outliers in an otherwise generalised softening of inflation pressures. Global trade volumes are finally showing signs of improvement amidst shifts in terms of trade, with exports rising strongly in several EMEs as well as in some AEs whose currencies have depreciated.International financial markets have been impacted by policy announcements in major AEs, geo-political events and country-specific factors. Equity markets in AEs were driven up by reflation trade, stronger incoming data and currency movements. Equity markets in EMEs had a mixed performance, reflecting domestic factors amidst a cautious return of investor appetite and capital flows. In the second half of March, dovish guidance on US monetary policy lifted equities across jurisdictions, especially in Asia, as the reach for EME assets resumed strongly, although doubts about the realisation of US policies, Brexit and softer crude prices tempered sentiments. Bond markets have mirrored the uncertainty surrounding the commitment to fiscal stimulus in the US and yields traded sideways in AEs, while they generally eased across EMEs. In the currency markets, the US dollar¡¯s bull run lost steam by mid-March. EME currencies initially rose on optimism on the global outlook, but some of them have weakened in recent days with the fall in commodity prices. Crude prices touched a three-month low in March on rising shale output and US inventories. Food prices have been firming up globally, driven by cereals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"On the domestic front, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) released its second advance estimates for 2016-17 on February 28, placing India¡¯s real GVA growth at 6.7 per cent for the year, down from 7 per cent in the first advance estimates released on January 6. Agriculture expanded robustly year-on-year after two consecutive years of sub-one per cent growth. In the industrial sector, there was a significant loss of momentum across all categories, barring electricity generation. The services sector also slowed, pulled down by trade, hotels, transport and communication as well as financial, real estate and professional services. Public administration, defence and other services cushioned this slowdown. To some extent, government expenditure made up for weakness in private consumption and capital formation.Several indicators are pointing to a modest improvement in the macroeconomic outlook. Foodgrains production has touched an all-time high of 272 million tonnes, with record production of rice, wheat and pulses. The record production of wheat should boost procurement operations and economise on imports, which had recently surged. Rice stocks, which had depleted to close to the minimum buffer norm, have picked up with kharif procurement. The bumper production of pulses has helped in building up to the intended buffer stock (i.e., 20 lakh tonnes) and this will keep the price of pulses under check _ the domestic price of pulses has already fallen below the minimum support price (MSP).Industrial output, measured by the index of industrial production (IIP), recovered in January from a contraction in the previous month, helped by a broad-based turnaround in manufacturing as well as mining and quarrying. Capital goods production improved appreciably, although this largely reflected the waning of unfavourable base effects. Consumer non-durables continued, however, to contract for the second successive month in spite of supportive base effects. Thus, investment and rural consumption demand remain muted. The output of core industries moderated in February due to slowdown in production of all the components except coal. The manufacturing purchasing managers¡¯ index (PMI) remained in expansion mode in February and rose to a five month high in March on the back of growth of new orders and output. The future output index also rose strongly on forecasts of pick-up in demand and the launch of new product lines. The 77th round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s industrial outlook survey indicates that overall business sentiment is expected to improve in Q1 of 2017-18 on the back of a sharp pick up in both domestic and external demand. Coincident indicators such as exports and non-oil non-gold imports are indicative of a brighter outlook for industry, although the sizable under-utilisation of capacity in several industries could operate as a drag on investment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Activity in the services sector appears to be improving as the constraining effects of demonetisation wear off. On the one hand, rural demand remains depressed as reflected in lower sales of two- and three-wheelers and fertiliser. On the other hand, high frequency indicators relating to railway traffic, telephone subscribers, foreign tourist arrivals, passenger car and commercial vehicles are regaining pace, thereby positioning the services sector on a rising trajectory. After three consecutive months of contraction, the services PMI for February and March emerged into the expansion zone on improvement in new business.After moderating continuously over the last six months to a historic low, retail inflation measured by year-on-year changes in the consumer price index (CPI) turned up in February to 3.7 per cent. While food prices bottomed out at the preceding month¡¯s level, base effects pushed up inflation in this category. Prices of sugar, fruits, meat, fish, milk and processed foods increased, generating a sizable jump in the momentum in the food group. In the fuel group, inflation increased as the continuous hardening of international prices lifted domestic prices of liquefied petroleum gas during December 2016 _ February 2017. Kerosene prices have also been increasing since July with the programmed reduction of the subsidy. Adapting to the movements in these salient prices, both three months ahead and a year ahead households¡¯ inflation expectations, which had dipped in the December round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s survey, reversed in the latest round. Moreover, the survey reveals hardening of price expectations across product groups. The 77th round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s industrial outlook survey indicates that pricing power is returning to corporates as profit margins get squeezed by input costs.Excluding food and fuel, inflation moderated in February by 20 basis points to 4.8 per cent, essentially on transient and item-specific factors. In February, favourable base effects were at work in the clothing and bedding sub-group as well as in personal care and effects, the latter also influenced by the disinflation in gold prices. The volatility in crude oil prices and its lagged pass-through are impacting the trajectory of CPI inflation excluding food and fuel. Much of the impact of the fall of US $4.5 per barrel in international prices of crude since early February would feed into the CPI print in April as its cumulative pass-through occurred with a lag in the first week of this month. Importantly, inflation excluding food and fuel has exhibited persistence and has been significantly above headline inflation since September 2016.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"With progressive remonetisation, the surplus liquidity in the banking system declined from a peak of _7,956 billion on January 4, 2017 to an average of _6,014 billion in February and further down to _4,806 billion in March. Currency in circulation expanded steadily during this period. Its impact on the liquidity overhang was, however, partly offset by a significant decline in cash balances of the Government up to mid-March which released liquidity into the system. Thereafter, the build-up of Government cash balances on account of advance tax payments and balance sheet adjustment by banks reduced surplus liquidity to _3,141 billion by end-March. Issuances of cash management bills (CMBs) under the market stabilisation scheme (MSS) ceased in mid-January and existing issues matured, with the consequent release of liquidity being absorbed primarily through variable rate reverse repo auctions of varying tenors. Accordingly, the average net absorption by the Reserve Bank increased from _2,002 billion in January to _4,483 billion in March. The weighted average call money rate (WACR) remained within the LAF corridor. The maturing of CMBs and reduced issuance of Treasury bills leading up to end-March has also contributed to Treasury bill rates being substantially below the policy rate.Merchandise exports rose strongly in February 2017 from a subdued profile in the preceding months. Growth impulses were broad-based, with major contributors being engineering goods, petroleum products, iron ore, rice and chemicals. The surge in imports in January and February 2017 largely reflected the effect of the hardening of commodity prices such as crude oil and coal. Non-oil non-gold imports continued to grow at a modest pace, though capital goods imports remained sluggish. With imports outpacing exports, the trade deficit widened in January and February from its level a year ago, though it was lower on a cumulative basis for the period April-February 2016-17.Balance of payments data for Q3 indicate that the current account deficit for the first three quarters of the financial year narrowed to 0.7 per cent of GDP, half of its level a year ago. For the year as a whole, the current account deficit is likely to remain muted at less than 1 per cent of GDP. Foreign direct investment (FDI) has dominated net capital inflows during April-December, with manufacturing, communication and financial services being the preferred sectors. Turbulence in global financial markets set off a bout of global risk aversion and flight to safe haven that caused net outflows of foreign portfolio investment (FPI) during November 2016 to January 2017. The tide reversed with the pricing in of the Fed¡¯s normalisation path and improvement in global growth prospects. FPI flows turned positive in February and welled up into a surge in March, especially in debt markets relative to equity markets (which had been the dominant recipient until February). This reversal appears to have been driven by stable domestic inflation, better than expected domestic growth, encouraging corporate earnings, clarity on FPI taxation, pro-reform budget proposals and state election results. The level of foreign exchange reserves was US$ 369.9 billion on March 31, 2017.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Since the February bi-monthly monetary policy statement, inflation has been quiescent. Headline CPI inflation is set to undershoot the target of 5.0 per cent for Q4 of 2016-17 in view of the sub-4 per cent readings for January and February. For 2017-18, inflation is projected to average 4.5 per cent in the first half of the year and 5 per cent in the second half (Chart 1).Risks are evenly balanced around the inflation trajectory at the current juncture. There are upside risks to the baseline projection. The main one stems from the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the south west monsoon in view of the rising probability of an El Ni_o event around July-August, and its implications for food inflation. Proactive supply management will play a critical role in staving off pressures on headline inflation. A prominent risk could emanate from managing the implementation of the allowances recommended by the 7th CPC. In case the increase in house rent allowance as recommended by the 7th CPC is awarded, it will push up the baseline trajectory by an estimated 100-150 basis points over a period of 12-18 months, with this initial statistical impact on the CPI followed up by second-order effects. Another upside risk arises from the one-off effects of the GST. The general government deficit, which is high by international comparison, poses yet another risk for the path of inflation, which is likely to be exacerbated by farm loan waivers. Recent global developments entail a reflation risk which may lift commodity prices further and pass through into domestic inflation. Moreover, geopolitical risks may induce global financial market volatility with attendant spillovers. On the downside, international crude prices have been easing recently and their pass-through to domestic prices of petroleum products should alleviate pressure on headline inflation. Also, stepped-up procurement operations in the wake of the record production of foodgrains will rebuild buffer stocks and mitigate food price stress, if it materialises.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Several favourable domestic factors are expected to drive this acceleration. First, the pace of remonetisation will continue to trigger a rebound in discretionary consumer spending. Activity in cash-intensive retail trade, hotels and restaurants, transportation and unorganised segments has largely been restored. Second, significant improvement in transmission of past policy rate reductions into banks¡¯ lending rates post demonetisation should help encourage both consumption and investment demand of healthy corporations. Third, various proposals in the Union Budget should stimulate capital expenditure, rural demand, and social and physical infrastructure all of which would invigorate economic activity. Fourth, the imminent materialisation of structural reforms in the form of the roll-out of the GST, the institution of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, and the abolition of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board will boost investor confidence and bring in efficiency gains. Fifth, the upsurge in initial public offerings in the primary capital market augurs well for investment and growth.The global environment is improving, with global output and trade projected by multilateral agencies to gather momentum in 2017. Accordingly, external demand should support domestic growth. Downside risks to the projected growth path stem from the outturn of the south west monsoon; ebbing consumer optimism on the outlook for income, the general economic situation and employment as polled in the March 2017 round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s consumer confidence survey; and, commodity prices, other than crude, hardening further.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Overall, the MPC¡¯s considered judgement call to wait out the unravelling of the transitory effects of demonetisation has been broadly borne out. While these effects are still playing out, they are distinctly on the wane and should fade away by the Q4 of 2016-17. While inflation has ticked up in its latest reading, its path through 2017-18 appears uneven and challenged by upside risks and unfavourable base effects towards the second half of the year. Moreover, underlying inflation pressures persist, especially in prices of services. Input cost pressures are gradually bringing back pricing power to enterprises as demand conditions improve. The MPC remains committed to bringing headline inflation closer to 4.0 per cent on a durable basis and in a calibrated manner. Accordingly, inflation developments have to be closely and continuously monitored, with food price pressures kept in check so that inflation expectations can be re-anchored. At the same time, the output gap is gradually closing. Consequently, aggregate demand pressures could build up, with implications for the inflation trajectory.Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to keep the policy rate unchanged in this review while persevering with a neutral stance. The future course of monetary policy will largely depend on incoming data on how macroeconomic conditions are evolving. Banks have reduced lending rates, although further scope for a more complete transmission of policy impulses remains, including for small savings/administered rates1. It is in this context that greater clarity about liquidity management is being provided, even as surplus liquidity is being steadily drained out. Along with rebalancing liquidity conditions, it will be the Reserve Bank¡¯s endeavour to put the resolution of banks¡¯ stressed assets on a firm footing and create congenial conditions for bank credit to revive and flow to productive sectors of the economy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Regulation, surveillance and enforcement are three important facets of financial sector oversight mechanism. Regulations determine the framework in which financial entities function so that prudence, transparency, and comparability are ensured on the one hand and customer interests are protected on the other. Surveillance is the process through which adherence to the regulations is monitored. Enforcement deals with cases of non-compliance with regulations noticed either through the surveillance process or otherwise. Currently, in the Reserve Bank, there is a clear demarcation of the regulatory and surveillance functions. With a view to developing a sound framework and process for enforcement action, it has been decided to establish a separate Enforcement Department. Necessary steps have been initiated in this regard and the new department will start functioning from April 1, 2017.Based on the recommendations of the Expert Panel on Information Technology Examination and Cyber Security (Chairperson: Smt. Meena Hemachandra), the Reserve Bank has issued guidelines to banks on June 2, 2016 mandating cyber security preparedness for addressing cyber risks.

Towards this end, an inter-disciplinary Standing Committee on Cyber Security is being constituted to, inter alia,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Global growth is projected to pick up modestly in 2017, after slowing down in the year gone by. Advanced economies (AEs) are expected to build upon the slow gathering of momentum that started in the second half of 2016, led by the US and Japan. However, uncertainty surrounds the direction of US macroeconomic policies with potential global spillovers. Growth prospects for emerging market economies (EMEs) are also expected to improve moderately, with recessionary conditions ebbing in Russia and Brazil, and China stabilising on policy stimulus. Inflation is edging up on the back of rising energy prices and a mild firming up of demand. However, global trade remains subdued due to an increasing tendency towards protectionist policies and heightened political tensions. Furthermore, financial conditions are likely to tighten as central banks in AEs normalise exceptional accommodation in monetary policy.International financial markets turned volatile from mid-January on concerns regarding the ¡®Brexit¡¯ roadmap and materialisation of expectations about economic policies of the new US administration. Within the rising profile of international commodity prices, crude oil prices firmed up with the OPEC¡¯s agreement to curtail production. Prices of base metals have also increased on expectations of fiscal stimulus in the US, strong infrastructure spending in China, and supply reductions. Geopolitical concerns have also hardened commodity prices. More recently, the appetite for risk has returned in AEs, buoying equity markets and hardening bond yields as a response to the growing likelihood of further increases in the Federal Funds rate during the year. Coupled with expectations of fiscal expansion in the US, this has propelled the US dollar to a multi-year high.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The Central Statistics Office (CSO) released its advance estimates for 2016-17 on January 6, placing India¡¯s real GVA growth at 7.0 per cent for the year, down from 7.8 per cent (first revised estimates released on January 31) a year ago. Agriculture and allied activities posted a strong pick-up, benefiting from the normal south-west monsoon, robust expansion in rabi acreage (higher by 5.7 per cent over the preceding year) and favourable base effects as well as the continuing resilience of allied activities. In contrast, the industrial sector experienced a sharp deceleration, mainly due to a slowdown in manufacturing and in mining and quarrying. Service sector activity also lost pace, concentrated in trade, hotels, transport and communication services, and construction, cushioned to some extent by public administration and defence.Industrial output measured by the index of industrial production (IIP) finally shrugged off the debilitating drag from insulated rubber cables from November and was also pushed up by a favourable base effect. In December, the output of core industries accelerated on a year-on-year as well as on a sequentially seasonally adjusted basis. The drivers of the upturn were steel production and petroleum refinery throughput, the former, inter alia, supported by import tariff safeguards and the latter buoyed by external demand. The acceleration in coal production and thermal electricity generation since November after three consecutive months of contraction augur well for the outlook for power. Reflecting these developments, the manufacturing purchasing managers¡¯ index (PMI) returned to expansion mode in January on the back of growth of new orders and output, and the future output index has risen strongly. On the other hand, the 76th round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s industrial outlook survey suggests that financing conditions facing the manufacturing sector have worsened in Q3 of 2016-17 and are expected to remain tight in Q4. This is corroborated by the sharp slowdown in bank credit to industry and continuing sluggishness in the investment climate in some sectors.High frequency indicators point to subdued activity in the services sector, particularly automobile sales across all segments, domestic air cargo, railway freight traffic, and cement production. Nevertheless, some areas stand out as bright spots, having weathered the transient effects of demonetisation _ steel consumption; port traffic; international air freight; foreign tourist arrivals; tractor sales; and, cellular telephone subscribers. The services PMI for January 2017 remained in retrenchment, but the fall in output was the least in the current phase of three consecutive months of contraction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Marking the fifth consecutive month of softening, retail inflation measured by the headline consumer price index (CPI) turned down sharper than expected in December and reached its lowest reading since November 2014. This outcome was driven by deflation in the prices of vegetables and pulses. Some moderation in the rate of increase in prices of protein-rich items _ eggs, meat and fish _ also aided the downturn in food inflation.Excluding food and fuel, inflation has been unyielding at 4.9 per cent since September. While some part of this inertial behaviour is attributable to the turnaround in international crude prices since October _ which fed into prices of petrol and diesel embedded in transport and communication _ a broad-based stickiness is discernible in inflation, particularly in housing, health, education, personal care and effects (excluding gold and silver) as well as miscellaneous goods and services consumed by households.The large overhang of liquidity consequent upon demonetisation weighed on money markets in December, but from mid-January rebalancing has been underway with expansion of currency in circulation and new bank notes being injected into the system at an accelerated pace. Throughout this period, the Reserve Bank¡¯s market operations have been in liquidity absorption mode. With the abolition of the incremental cash reserve ratio from December 10, liquidity management operations have consisted of variable rate reverse repos under the LAF of tenors ranging from overnight to 91 days and auctions of cash management bills under the market stabilisation scheme (MSS) of tenors ranging from 14 to 63 days. The average daily net absorption under the LAF was _ 1.6 trillion in December, _ 2.0 trillion in January and _ 3.7 trillion in February (up to February 7) while under the MSS, it was _ 3.8 trillion, _ 5.0 trillion and _ 2.9 trillion, respectively. Money market rates remained aligned with the policy repo rate albeit with a soft bias, with the weighted average call money rate (WACR) averaging 18 basis points below the policy rate during December and January.Turning to the external sector, export growth remained in the positive zone for the fourth month in succession in December. Imports other than petroleum oil and lubricants (POL) came out of the spike in November and moderated in December. In contrast, there was an increase of over 10 per cent in POL imports, in part reflecting the rise in international crude oil prices. Overall, the trade deficit shrank both sequentially and on a year-on-year basis, being lower for the period April-December by US$ 23.5 billion than its level a year ago. On the whole, the current account deficit is likely to remain muted and below 1 per cent of GDP in 2016-17. While the buoyancy in net foreign direct investment was sustained, there have been portfolio outflows beginning October on uncertainty relating to the direction of US macroeconomic policies and expectations of faster normalisation of US monetary policy in the year ahead. Foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 363.1 billion on February 3, 2017.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"In the fifth bi-monthly statement of December, headline inflation was projected at 5 per cent in Q4 of 2016-17 with risks lower than before but still tilted to the upside. The decline in headline CPI inflation in November and December has been larger than expected, but almost exclusively on the back of deflation in vegetables and pulses. While the seasonal ebb in the prices of vegetables that usually occurs with the onset of winter as well as some demand compression may have contributed to this outcome, anecdotal evidence points to some distress sales of perishables having accentuated the decline in vegetable prices, with spillovers into January as well. Looking beyond, prices of pulses are likely to remain soft with comfortable supply conditions, while vegetable prices may potentially rebound as the effects of demonetisation wear off.The Committee is of the view that the persistence of inflation excluding food and fuel could set a floor on further downward movements in headline inflation and trigger second-order effects. Nevertheless, headline CPI inflation in Q4 of 2016-17 is likely to be below 5 per cent. Favourable base effects and lagged effects of demand compression may mute headline inflation in Q1 of 2017-18. Thereafter, it is expected to pick up momentum, especially as growth picks up and the output gap narrows. Moreover, base effects will reverse and turn adverse during Q3 and Q4 of 2017-18. Accordingly, inflation is projected in the range of 4.0 to 4.5 per cent in the first half of the financial year and in the range of 4.5 to 5.0 per cent in the second half with risks evenly balanced around this projected path (Chart 1). In this context, it is important to note three significant upside risks that impart some uncertainty to the baseline inflation path _ the hardening profile of international crude prices; volatility in the exchange rate on account of global financial market developments, which could impart upside pressures to domestic inflation; and the fuller effects of the house rent allowances under the 7th Central Pay Commission (CPC) award which have not been factored in the baseline inflation path. The focus of the Union budget on growth revival without compromising on fiscal prudence should bode well for limiting upside risks to inflation.GVA growth for 2016-17 is projected at 6.9 per cent with risks evenly balanced around it. Growth is expected to recover sharply in 2017-18 on account of several factors. First, discretionary consumer demand held back by demonetisation is expected to bounce back beginning in the closing months of 2016-17. Second, economic activity in cash-intensive sectors such as retail trade, hotels and restaurants, and transportation, as well as in the unorganised sector, is expected to be rapidly restored. Third, demonetisation-induced ease in bank funding conditions has led to a sharp improvement in transmission of past policy rate reductions into marginal cost-based lending rates (MCLRs), and in turn, to lending rates for healthy borrowers, which should spur a pick-up in both consumption and investment demand. Fourth, the emphasis in the Union Budget for 2017-18 on stepping up capital expenditure, and boosting the rural economy and affordable housing should contribute to growth. Accordingly, GVA growth for 2017-18 is projected at 7.4 per cent, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The Committee remains committed to bringing headline inflation closer to 4.0 per cent on a durable basis and in a calibrated manner. This requires further significant decline in inflation expectations, especially since the services component of inflation that is sensitive to wage movements has been sticky. The committee decided to change the stance from accommodative to neutral while keeping the policy rate on hold to assess how the transitory effects of demonetisation on inflation and the output gap play out.The Reserve Bank has conducted market liquidity operations consistent with the liquidity management framework put in place in April 2016, progressively moving the system level ex ante liquidity conditions to close to neutrality. This stance will continue. Surplus liquidity should decline with progressive remonetisation. Nonetheless, the currently abundant liquidity with banks is likely to persist into the early months of 2017-18. The Reserve Bank is committed to ensuring efficient and appropriate liquidity management with all the instruments at its command to ensure close alignment of the WACR with the policy rate, improved transmission of policy impulses to lending rates, and adequate flow of credit to productive sectors of the economy.The Committee believes that the environment for timely transmission of policy rates to banks lending rates will be considerably improved if (i) the banking sector¡¯s non-performing assets (NPAs) are resolved more quickly and efficiently; (ii) recapitalisation of the banking sector is hastened; and, (iii) the formula for adjustments in the interest rates on small savings schemes to changes in yields on government securities of corresponding maturity is fully implemented.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Global growth picked up modestly in the second half of 2016, after weakening in the first half. Activity in advanced economies (AEs) improved hesitantly, led by a rebound in the US. In the emerging market economies (EMEs), growth has moderated, but policy stimulus in China and some easing of stress in the larger commodity exporters shored up momentum. World trade is beginning to emerge out of a trough that bottomed out in July-August and shows signs of stabilising. Inflation has ticked up in some AEs, though well below target, and is easing in several EMEs. Expectations of reflationary fiscal policies in the US, Japan and China, and the waning of downward pressures on EMEs in recession are tempered by still-prevalent political risks in the euro area and the UK, emerging geo-political risks and the spectre of financial market volatility.International financial markets were strongly impacted by the result of the US presidential election and incoming data that raised the probability of the Federal Reserve tightening monetary policy. As bouts of volatility fuelled a risk-off surge into US equities and out of fixed income markets, a risk-on stampede pulled out capital flows from EMEs, plunging their currencies and equity markets to recent lows even as bond yields hardened in tandem with US yields. The surge of the US dollar from late October intensified after the election results and triggered sizable depreciations in currencies around the world. Commodity prices firmed up across the board from mid-November on an improvement in the outlook for demand following the US election results, barring gold which lost its safe haven glitter to the ascendant US dollar. Crude prices have firmed after the OPEC¡¯s decision to cut output.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"On the domestic front, the growth of real gross value added (GVA) in Q2 of 2016-17 turned out to be lower than projected on account of a deeper than expected slowdown in industrial activity. Manufacturing slowed down both sequentially and on an annual basis, with weak demand conditions and the firming up of input costs dragging down the profitability of corporations. Gross fixed capital formation contracted for the third consecutive quarter. Although government final consumption expenditure slowed sequentially, it supported private final consumption expenditure, the mainstay of aggregate demand. The contribution of net exports to aggregate demand remained positive, but on account of a sharper contraction in imports relative to exports.Turning to Q3, the Committee felt that the assessment is clouded by the still unfolding effects of the withdrawal of specified bank notes (SBNs). The steady expansion in acreage under rabi sowing across major crops compared to a year ago should build on the robust performance of agriculture in Q2. By contrast, industrial activity remains weak. Among the core industries in the index of industrial production (IIP), the output of coal contracted in October due to subdued demand, while the production of crude oil and natural gas shrank under the binding constraint of structural impediments. The production of cement, fertilisers and electricity continued to decelerate, reflecting the sluggishness in underlying economic activity. On the other hand, steel output has recorded sustained expansion following the application of countervailing duties. Refinery output accelerated on the back of a pick-up in exports and capacity additions. The withdrawal of SBNs could transiently interrupt some part of industrial activity in November-December due to delays in payments of wages and purchases of inputs, although a fuller assessment is awaited. In the services sector, the outlook is mixed with construction, trade, transport, hotels and communication impacted by temporary SBN effects, while public administration, defence and other services would continue to be buoyed by the 7th Central Pay Commission (CPC) award and one rank one pension (OROP). GVA by financial services is expected to receive a short-term boost from the large inflow of low-cost deposits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Retail inflation measured by the headline consumer price index (CPI) eased more than expected for the third consecutive month in October, driven down by a sharper than anticipated deflation in the prices of vegetables. Underlying this softer reading, however, was an upturn in momentum as prices rose month-on-month across the board. Still elevated prices of sugar and protein-rich items, coupled with a turning up of prices of cereals, pulses and processed foods pushed up the momentum of food prices, which partly offset the moderation in food inflation brought about by a strong favourable base effect. In the fuel category, inflation eased with the decline in LPG prices on an annual basis and a fall in electricity prices from a month ago. Inflation excluding food and fuel continues to show strong persistence. Although housing and personal care inflation softened marginally, the steady rise in inflation in respect of education, medical and health services, and transport and communication has imparted stickiness to inflation in this category.Liquidity conditions have undergone large shifts in Q3 so far. Surplus conditions in October and early November were overwhelmed by the impact of the withdrawal of SBNs from November 9. Currency in circulation plunged by _7.4 trillion up to December 2; consequently, net of replacements, deposits surged into the banking system, leading to a massive increase in its excess reserves. The Reserve Bank scaled up its liquidity operations through variable rate reverse repo auctions of a wide range of tenors from overnight to 91 days, absorbing liquidity (net) of _5.2 trillion. The Reserve Bank allowed oil bonds issued by the Government as eligible securities under the LAF. From the fortnight beginning November 26, an incremental CRR of 100 per cent was applied on the increase in net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) between September 16, 2016 and November 11, 2016 as a temporary measure to drain excess liquidity from the system. From November 28, liquidity absorption fell back and the Reserve Bank undertook variable rate repo auctions of _3.3 trillion on November 28. As expected, money market conditions tightened thereafter and the weighted average call rate (WACR) traded near the upper bound of the LAF corridor on that day before dropping back to the policy repo rate on November 30. All other rates in the system firmed up in sympathy, with term premia getting restored gradually. Through this episode, active liquidity management prevented the WACR from falling even to the fixed rate reverse repo rate, the lower bound of the LAF corridor. Liquidity management was bolstered by an increase in the limit on securities under the market stabilisation scheme (MSS) from _0.3 trillion to _6 trillion on November 29. There have been three issuances of cash management bills under MSS for _1.4 trillion by December 6, 2016. In the external sector, India¡¯s merchandise exports rebounded in September and October. The return to positive territory was supported by a pick-up in both POL and non-POL exports. After a prolonged fall for 22 months, imports rose in October on the back of a sharp rise in the volume of gold imports and higher payments for POL imports. Non-oil non-gold import growth also turned positive after a gap of seven months. For the period April-October, the merchandise trade deficit was lower by US $ 25 billion from its level a year ago. Accordingly, the current account deficit is likely to remain muted, notwithstanding some loss of remittances and software exports under invisibles. Net foreign direct investment has remained reasonably robust, with more than half going to manufacturing, communication and financial services. By contrast, portfolio investment outflows of the order of US $ 7.3 billion occurred in October-November from both debt and equity markets _ as in peer EMEs across the board _ reflecting a strong home bias triggered by the outcome of the US presidential election and the near-certainty of monetary policy tightening in the US. The level of foreign exchange reserves was US$ 364 billion on December 2, 2016.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The Committee took note of the upturn in the prices of several items that is masked by the easing of inflation on base effects during October. Despite some supply disruptions, the abrupt compression of demand in November due to the withdrawal of SBNs could push down the prices of perishables in the reading that becomes available in December. On the other hand, prices of wheat, gram and sugar have been firming up. While discretionary spending on goods and services in the CPI excluding food and fuel _ constituting 16 per cent of the CPI basket _ could have been affected by restricted access to cash, the prices of these items may weather these transitory effects as they are normally revised according to pre-set cycles. Prices of housing, fuel and light, health, transport and communication, pan, tobacco and intoxicants, and education _ together accounting for 38 per cent of the CPI basket _ may remain largely unaffected. Going forward, base effects are expected to reverse and turn unfavourable in December and February. If the usual winter moderation in food prices does not materialise due to the disruptions, food inflation pressures could re-emerge. Furthermore, CPI inflation excluding food and fuel has been resistant to downward impulses and could set a floor to headline inflation. With the OPEC¡¯s agreement to cut production, crude prices may firm up in the coming months. Global developments, especially as financial markets factor in the future stance of US monetary and fiscal policy, could impart volatility to the exchange rate thereby feeding into inflation. The withdrawal of SBNs could result in a possible temporary reduction in inflation of the order of 10-15 basis points in Q3. Taking these factors into account, headline inflation is projected at 5 per cent in Q4 of 2016-17 with risks tilted to the upside but lower than in the October policy review. The fuller effects of the house rent allowances under the 7th CPC award are yet to be assessed, pending implementation, and have not been reckoned in this baseline inflation path (Chart 1).The outlook for GVA growth for 2016-17 has turned uncertain after the unexpected loss of momentum by 50 basis points in Q2 and the effects of the withdrawal of SBNs which are still playing out. Downside risks in the near term could travel through two major channels: (a) short-run disruptions in economic activity in cash-intensive sectors such as retail trade, hotels & restaurants and transportation, and in the unorganised sector; (b) aggregate demand compression associated with adverse wealth effects. The impact of the first channel should, however, ebb with the progressive increase in the circulation of new currency notes and greater usage of non-cash based payment instruments in the economy, while the impact of the second channel is likely to be limited. In October 2016, GVA growth in H2 was projected at 7.7 per cent and for the full year at 7.6 per cent. Incorporating the expected loss of growth momentum in Q3 and waning effects in Q4 alongside the boost to consumption demand from higher agricultural output and the implementation of the 7th CPC award, GVA growth for 2016-17 is revised down from 7.6 per cent to 7.1 per cent, with evenly balanced risks (Chart 2).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The liquidity management framework was refined in April with the objective of meeting short-term liquidity needs through regular facilities, frictional and seasonal mismatches through fine-tuning operations and more durable liquidity needs for facilitating growth by modulating net foreign assets and net domestic assets. The Reserve Bank has conducted liquidity management consistent with this framework, progressively moving the system level ex ante liquidity conditions to close to neutrality. In Q3 up to early November, liquidity conditions remained in mild surplus mode. The Reserve Bank injected liquidity of _1.1 trillion through OMO purchases during the fiscal year so far, including an OMO purchase auction of _100 billion in October. Although the replacement of SBNs has engendered large surplus liquidity warranting exceptional operations, this needs to be seen as transitory. The Reserve Bank is committed to conducting liquidity operations in pursuit of the objectives of the revised framework put in place in April to restore system level liquidity to a position of neutrality as the surplus liquidity pressures abate. In the view of the Committee, this bi-monthly review is set against the backdrop of heightened uncertainty. Globally, the imminent tightening of monetary policy in the US is triggering bouts of high volatility in financial markets, with the possibility of large spillovers that could have macroeconomic implications for EMEs. In India, while supply disruptions in the backwash of currency replacement may drag down growth this year, it is important to analyse more information and experience before judging their full effects and their persistence _ short-term developments that influence the outlook disproportionately warrant caution with respect to setting the monetary policy stance. If the impact is transient as widely expected, growth should rebound strongly. Turning to inflation, food prices other than vegetables are exhibiting sustained firmness and a pick-up in momentum. Another disconcerting feature of recent developments is the downward inflexibility in inflation excluding food and fuel which could set a resistance level for future downward movements in the headline. Moreover, volatility in crude prices and the surge in financial market turbulence could put the inflation target for Q4 of 2016-17 at some risk. Given these indicators of underlying inflation, it is appropriate to look through the transitory but unclear effects of the withdrawal of SBNs while setting the monetary policy stance. On balance, therefore, it is prudent to wait and watch how these factors play out and impinge upon the outlook. Accordingly, the policy repo rate has been kept on hold in this review, while retaining an accommodative policy stance.Six members voted in favour of the monetary policy decision. The minutes of the MPC¡¯s meeting will be published on December 21, 2016. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled on February 7 & 8, 2017 and its resolution will be placed on the Reserve Bank¡¯s website on February 8, 2017.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Since the sixth bi-monthly statement of February 2016, global economic activity has been quiescent. Perceptions of downside risks to recovery in some advanced economies (AEs) at the beginning of 2016 have eased, while major emerging market economies (EMEs) continue to contend with weak growth and still elevated inflation amidst tighter financial conditions. World trade remains subdued due to falling import demand from EMEs and stress in mining and extractive industries. In the US, consumer spending was underpinned by a strengthening labour market, but flagging exports proved to be a drag on growth in Q4 and cloud the near-term outlook. In the Euro area, tailwinds in the form of aggressive monetary policy accommodation and still low energy prices have supported activity in an environment beset with uncertainties from the migrant crisis, intensifying stress in the banking sector, and possible Brexit. While Japan escaped recession in Q4 of 2015, a combination of weak consumer spending, business investment and exports has slowed the economy in Q1 of 2016. In China, sluggish industrial production, contracting exports, capital outflows and substantial excess capacity in factories and the property market remain formidable headwinds, notwithstanding significant monetary and fiscal policy stimulus. EME commodity exporters have benefited recently from the firming up of commodity prices and risk-on investor sentiment has appreciated their currencies. Across EMEs, however, weak domestic fundamentals, lacklustre external demand and country-specific constraints continue to restrain growth. Global financial markets have recouped the losses suffered in the turbulence at the beginning of the year. From mid-February, a firming up of crude prices buoyed market sentiment, allaying fears of global recessionary risks. With China reducing reserve requirements, the ECB expanding accommodation and the Fed providing dovish guidance while staying on hold, equity markets rallied. In bond markets across AEs and EMEs, yields gradually eased, with country-specific variations. The US dollar has retreated from January peak and has eased further in the aftermath of the FOMC¡¯s March meeting. On the other hand, the euro and the yen have appreciated, reacting perversely to exceptional accommodation. Currencies across EMEs have also appreciated as portfolio flows returned cautiously to local debt and equity markets. Gold prices have jumped 16 per cent in Q1 of 2016 on safe haven demand. Commodity prices, including oil,  have picked up recently, though they still remain soft. However, the uneasy calm that prevails in financial markets could be dispelled easily by a sudden return of risk-off investor sentiment on incoming data, especially pertaining to China or to US inflation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"On the domestic front, gross value added (GVA) in agriculture and allied activities moderated in H2 of 2015-16, pulled down by the contraction in Q3 due to the year-on-year decline in kharif production.  Turning to Q4, second advance estimates of the Ministry of Agriculture indicate that despite acutely low reservoir levels and a deficient north-east monsoon, rabi foodgrains production increased over its level a year ago _ mainly in wheat and pulses _ and compensated partly for the shortfall in kharif output. Unseasonal rains and hail in March are likely to have damaged some winter crops, particularly wheat, although full estimates of the crop loss await  advance estimates. On the other hand, fertiliser production has picked up, and horticulture as well as allied activities have remained resilient, suggesting that the implicit estimate of GVA for agricultural and allied activities in Q4 in the CSO¡¯s advance estimates is likely to be achieved, if not revised upwards.Value added in industry accelerated in H2, led by manufacturing which benefited from the sustained softness in input costs. By contrast, industrial production remained flat with manufacturing output shrinking since November. Robust expansion in coal output has buoyed both mining activity and electricity generation and stemmed the weakening of industrial output. However, capital goods production fell into deep contraction since November, even after excluding lumpy and volatile items like rubber insulated cable. Weak demand and competition from imports have muted the capex cycle. Consumer non-durables production has been shrinking, with a pronounced decline in Q4. This reflects the continuing slack in rural demand. On the other hand, consumer durables remained strong, even after abstracting from favourable base effects, which suggests that urban demand is holding up. With improved perceptions on overall economic conditions and income, the Reserve Bank¡¯s Consumer Confidence Survey of March 2016 shows marginal improvement in consumer sentiments. The March manufacturing purchasing managers¡¯ index (PMI) continued in expansionary mode on the back of new orders, including exports. The Reserve Bank¡¯s industrial outlook survey suggests that business expectations for Q1 of 2016-17 continue to be positive.Services sector activity expanded steadily through the year, with trade, hotels, transport, communication and public administration, defence and related services turning out to be the main drivers in H2. The construction sector continues to be overburdened by unsold inventory in the residential space, although commercial real estate is being boosted by demand from information technology (IT) and IT-enabled services. Road construction has accelerated, including in terms of new awards. Cement production appears to have gained traction during H2, while steel consumption has increased at a steady pace. Various lead and coincident indicators such as air passenger traffic, air cargo volumes, foreign tourist arrivals and auto sales increased, while railway freight traffic marginally contracted. The services PMI remained in expansion mode during H2 on new business and expectations. The outlook for services in surveys is upbeat for Q1 of 2016-17.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Retail inflation measured by the consumer price index (CPI) dropped sharply in February after rising for six consecutive months. This favourable development was due to a larger than anticipated decline in vegetable prices, helped by prices of pulses starting to come off the surge that began in August, and effective supply management that helped limit cereal price increases. Accordingly, food inflation eased for the first time in the second half of 2015-16. Notably, this occurred on a decline in prices rather than favourable base effects, which were at work in the first half of the year. Inflation in the fuel group moderated across electricity, kerosene, cooking gas and firewood, the latter easing pressures on rural inflation. Three months ahead household inflation expectations declined to a single digit for the second consecutive round of the survey in response to these dynamics.CPI inflation excluding food and fuel edged up in February, mainly under housing, education, personal care and transport and communication, suggesting capacity constraints in the services sector. Excluding petrol and diesel from this category, inflation stayed elevated and persistent at or above 5 per cent, indicating a possible resistance level for further downward movements in the headline. The stubborn underlying inflation momentum is unlikely to be helped by the 7th Pay Commission award and the effects of the one-rank-one-pension (OROP) award, or by the cost-push effect of the increase in the service tax rate. However, rural wage growth as well as the rate of increase in corporate staff costs was moderate. Also, input and output prices polled in purchasing managers¡¯ surveys rose modestly for manufacturing and services.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Liquidity conditions, which had tightened since mid-December, were stretched further by the larger-than-usual accumulation of cash balances by the Government, unusually heightened and persistent demand for currency, a pick-up in bank credit and flatter deposit mobilisation at this time relative to past years. The Reserve Bank undertook liquidity operations to quell these pressures and supplemented normal operations with large amounts of liquidity injected through fine-tuning variable rate repo auctions in tenors ranging between overnight and 56 days. The average daily liquidity injection (including variable rate overnight and term repos) increased from _ 1,345 billion in January to _ 1,935 billion in March. Besides, durable liquidity was also provided through open market operations (OMOs) of the order of _ 514 billion and _ 375 billion through buy-back operations in February and March. The Reserve Bank also started conducting reverse repo and MSF operations on holidays in Mumbai to enable the frictionless functioning of the payment and settlement system.Effective April 2, 2016 the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) of scheduled commercial banks was reduced by 25 basis points from 21.5 per cent to 21.25 per cent of their NDTL. Also, from February 2016, banks were allowed to reckon additional government securities held by them up to 3 per cent of their NDTL within the mandatory SLR requirement as level 1 high quality liquid assets (HQLA)  for the purpose of computing their liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), thereby taking the total carve-out from SLR available to banks equivalent to 10 per cent of their NDTL. These measures will create space for banks to increase their lending to productive sectors on competitive terms so as to support investment and growth.FCNR(B) deposits and associated swaps undertaken in September 2013 are expected to mature starting September this year. It is important to note that these swaps are fully covered by the Reserve Bank¡¯s forward purchases. Moreover, the Reserve Bank will monitor developments closely to contain any unanticipated market volatility associated with the repayment.While exports declined in February in US dollar terms for the fifteenth successive month, the rate of contraction narrowed to a single digit for the first time in this period and volume growth turned positive. The decline in non-POL exports was even smaller, with gems and jewellery, drugs and pharmaceuticals, electronics and chemicals driving the upturn. The prolonged contraction in imports also slowed significantly, and non-POL non-gold import growth turned positive for the first time after seven months. This reflected a sizable upsurge in imports of machinery, supported by a pick-up in imports of pearls and precious stones and electronic goods. With gold imports falling in February and March, the continuing softness in crude prices working favourably in terms of conserving the POL import bill and some gains in terms of trade, the trade deficit narrowed to its lowest monthly level since September 2013. In turn, this has likely lowered the current account deficit (CAD) in Q4 below 1.3 per cent of GDP recorded in Q3, despite a moderation in net receipts from services exports and remittances. Net inflows in the form of foreign direct investment (FDI) were robust in Q4 (up to January), more than sufficient to fund the external financing requirement. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs), who were net sellers in the domestic capital market up to February, became net buyers in March in both equity and debt segments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Inflation has evolved along the projected trajectory and the target set for January 2016 was met with a marginal undershoot. Going forward, CPI inflation is expected to decelerate modestly and remain around 5 per cent during 2016-17 with small inter-quarter variations (Chart 1). There are uncertainties surrounding this inflation path emanating from recent unseasonal rains, the likely spatial and temporal distribution of monsoon, the low reservoir levels by historical averages, and the strength of the recent upturn in commodity prices, especially oil. The persistence of inflation in certain services warrants watching, while the implementation of the 7th Central Pay Commission awards will impart an upside to the baseline through direct and indirect effects. On the other hand, there will be some offsetting downside pressures stemming from tepid demand in the global economy, Government¡¯s effective supply side measures keeping a check on food prices, and the Central Government¡¯s commendable commitment to fiscal consolidation. The uneven recovery in growth in 2015-16 is likely to strengthen gradually into 2016-17, assuming a normal monsoon, the likely boost to consumption demand from the implementation of the 7th Pay Commission recommendations and OROP, and continuing monetary policy accommodation. After two consecutive years of deficient monsoon, a normal monsoon would work as a favourable supply shock, strengthening rural demand and augmenting the supply of farm products that also influence inflation. On the other hand, the fading impact of lower input costs on value addition in manufacturing, persisting corporate sector stress and risk aversion in the banking system, and the weaker global growth and trade outlook could impart a downside to growth outcomes going forward. The GVA growth projection for 2016-17 is accordingly retained at 7.6 per cent, with risks evenly balanced around it (Chart 2).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"In its bi-monthly monetary policy statement of February 2, 2016, the Reserve Bank indicated that it awaits further data on inflation as well as on structural reforms in the Union Budget that boost growth while controlling spending. Given recent data, forecasts in Chart 1 indicate that inflation will trend towards the 5 per cent target in March 2017 under reasonable assumptions. The changes to the RBI Act to create a Monetary Policy Committee will further strengthen monetary policy credibility. In the Union Budget for 2016-17, the Government has adhered to the path of fiscal consolidation and this will support the disinflation process going forward. The Government has also set out a comprehensive strategy for reinvigorating demand in the rural economy, enhancing the economy¡¯s social and physical infrastructure, and improving the environment for doing business and deepening institutional reform. The implementation of these measures should improve supply conditions and allow efficiency and productivity gains to accrue. Given weak private investment in the face of low capacity utilisation, a reduction in the policy rate by 25 bps will help strengthen activity and aid the Government¡¯s initiatives.Perhaps more important at this juncture is to ensure that current and past policy rate cuts transmit to lending rates. The reduction in small savings rates announced in March 2016, the substantial refinements in the liquidity management framework announced in this policy review and the introduction of the marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) should improve transmission and magnify the effects of the current policy rate cut. The stance of monetary policy will remain accommodative. The Reserve Bank will continue to watch macroeconomic and financial developments in the months ahead with a view to responding with further policy action as space opens up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The Reserve Bank¡¯s liquidity framework was changed significantly in September 2014 in order to implement key recommendations of the Expert Committee to Revise and Strengthen the Monetary Policy Framework (Chairman: Dr. Urjit R Patel). With over six quarters of implementation history, it is appropriate to review the experience, with a view to making necessary adjustments as well as to more fully implement the report of the Expert Committee.Liquidity management is driven by two objectives: first, the need to supply or withdraw short term liquidity from the market so as to accommodate seasonal and frictional liquidity needs such as the build-up of Government balances and demand for cash; and second, the need to supply durable liquidity in the economy so as to facilitate growth, while ensuring that the monetary policy stance is supported.The Reserve Bank has kept the system in an ex ante deficit mode on average, with a liquidity shortfall equivalent to one per cent of banks¡¯ NDTL. The rationale has been that the banking system would borrow from the Reserve Bank¡¯s liquidity facilities, ensuring that the repo rate guided short term money market rates and thereby was effective as the policy rate.The first objective of meeting short term liquidity needs has been accomplished through the provision of liquidity by the Reserve Bank under its regular facilities - variable rate 14-day/7-day repo auctions equivalent to 0.75 per cent of banking system NDTL, supplemented by daily overnight fixed rate repos (at the repo rate) equivalent to 0.25 per cent of bank-wise NDTL. Frictional and seasonal mismatches that move the system away from normal liquidity provision are addressed through fine-tuning operations, including variable rate repo/reverse repo auctions of varying tenors. The weighted average call money rate has tracked the policy rate more closely than in the past, suggesting that short term liquidity needs have been adequately met.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The Reserve Bank aims to meet the second objective by modulating net foreign assets (NFA) and net domestic assets (NDA) growth over the course of the year, broadly consistent with the demand for liquid assets to meet transaction needs of the economy. This will ensure adequate availability of durable liquidity, regardless of short term seasonal and frictional fluctuations. The Reserve Bank tries to smooth this growth over the year. So, for example, in periods when the Reserve Bank purchases significant quantities of NFA, the growth of NDA may have to be commensurately lower and may even have to be negative through the open market sale of domestic bonds.Experience suggests that the provision of short term liquidity does not substitute fully for needed durable liquidity, though durable liquidity can substitute for short term liquidity needs. Going forward, the Reserve Bank intends to first meet requirements of durable liquidity, and then use its fine-tuning operations to make short term liquidity conditions consistent with the intended policy stance. This may result in seemingly anomalous situations in which the Reserve Bank injects durable liquidity even when it is using short term instruments to withdraw excess short term liquidity, but such actions will be consistent with our dual objectives of liquidity management.Finally, given that new instruments such as variable rate reverse repo auctions allow the Reserve Bank to suck out excess short term liquidity from the system without the excess liquidity being deposited with the Reserve Bank through overnight fixed rate reverse repo, it is possible for the Reserve Bank to keep the system closer to balance on average without the operational rate falling significantly. Thus, the past rationale for keeping the system in significant average liquidity deficit no longer is as compelling, especially when the policy stance is intended to be accommodative. Moreover, given that the Reserve Bank¡¯s market operations rather than depositing or borrowing at standing facilities determine the operational interest rate, the policy rate corridor can be narrowed, as suggested by the Expert Committee.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Since the fifth bi-monthly statement of December 2015, global growth has slowed, with the ongoing weakening of activity in major emerging market economies (EMEs) outweighing the recovery in some advanced economies (AEs). World trade has remained subdued, held down by anaemic demand, new lows in commodity prices and currency realignments. In the United States, an improving labour market continues to support a consumption-led recovery. Manufacturing activity is sluggish, however, reflecting retrenchment in oil and gas drilling activity and declining exports. In the Euro area, improving labour market and financing conditions are supporting consumer spending and business investment. Although core inflation and wage growth are subdued, deflation risks appear to be receding. In Japan, the combination of exceptional monetary accommodation and fiscal stimulus has failed to spur sustainable domestic demand so far. In China, growth in Q4 of 2015 was the slowest since 2009, pulled down by manufacturing, residential investment and exports. EME commodity exporters confront recessionary conditions, falling currencies, sluggish exports and still high inflation relative to their recent histories.The December calm in global financial markets _ suggesting that the normalisation of US monetary policy was fully anticipated _ was dispelled in January 2016 by fears of further weakening of the Chinese economy and the depreciation of the Renminbi. Capital outflows from China triggered sell-offs across AEs and EMEs, exacerbating currency declines and heightening volatility. Crude oil prices fell below US $ 30 per barrel _ a 12-year low _on expectations of Iran adding to the supply glut. Prices of gold prices and US Treasuries hardened on safe haven demand. Financial markets remain vulnerable to bouts of volatility and capital outflows from EMEs as an asset class. Bearish commodity price dynamics are also likely to impact investor sentiment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"On the domestic front, economic activity lost momentum in Q3 of 2015-16, pulled down by slackening agricultural and industrial growth. The north-east monsoon season ended in December with a deficiency of 23 per cent relative to the long period average (LPA). By end-January, rabi sowing was mildly deficient relative to a year ago, as well as to the quinquennial average in respect of all crops, except coarse cereals. Rural incomes will continue to be supported by allied activities such as dairy and horticulture, which now contribute as much to GDP as food grains.In the first two months of Q3 of 2015-16, industrial activity slowed in relation to the preceding quarter. This mainly reflects weak investment demand with some deceleration of capital goods production. Stalled projects continue to remain high, and there is a decline in new investment intentions, perhaps on the back of low capacity utilization. While revenue growth in manufacturing has been modest, the fall in costs, partly because of a decline in commodity prices, and partly because of improvements in manufacturing efficiency, have resulted in relatively stronger profitability. The Reserve Bank¡¯s industrial outlook survey suggests a modest expansion of activity likely in Q4. In January 2016, the manufacturing purchasing managers¡¯ index (PMI) expanded to a four-month high on, inter alia, resumption of output by firms affected by the December floods as well as on new domestic and export orders.Lead indicators of the services sector are mixed. Construction activity is still tepid, as evidenced by weak growth in cement production, though the pick-up in road construction bodes well for future activity, especially if supported by construction in the major proposed industrial corridors. Railway freight growth is still weak, though it may reflect lower transport needs for inputs like coal, and competition from roadways. However, the services PMI rose to a ten-month high in December on improvement in new business orders and upbeat expectations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Retail inflation measured by the consumer price index (CPI) rose for the fifth month in December across all constituent categories. While the upturn in December essentially reflected unfavourable base effects, the ongoing seasonal decline in prices of fruits and vegetables could temper headline inflation in the near-term. Prices of cereals recorded modest increases despite the adverse monsoon, indicative of effective supply management. On the other hand, pulses inflation continued to remain elevated, reflecting structural mismatches.CPI inflation excluding food and fuel rose for the fourth successive month. Excluding petrol and diesel from this category, inflation remained flat. A breakdown into goods and services categories shows that while goods inflation declined, services inflation has been sticky since September 2015 across housing, transport and communication, medical and other services. Household inflation expectations remain elevated and the rate of increase in corporate staff costs picked up. On the other hand, rural wage growth has been muted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Liquidity conditions tightened in the second half of December with advance tax outflows. Tightness spilled over into January 2016 on the back of a seasonal pick-up in demand for currency, restrained spending by the government and a pick-up in bank credit growth, in relation to deposit mobilisation. In order to mitigate these conditions, the Reserve Bank injected liquidity through variable rate term repos of varying tenors ranging from overnight to 56 days, besides provision through the regular liquidity windows. The average daily liquidity injection (including variable rate overnight and term repos) increased from _ 1,200 billion in December to about _ 1,345 billion in January. In addition, the Reserve Bank also injected _ 200 billion through open market purchase operations on December 7 and January 20. In response, money market rates remained close to the policy rate with a marginal downside bias. Bank credit in the form of personal loans and non-bank flows from both domestic and foreign sources grew strongly.India¡¯s exports remained in contraction mode for the thirteenth successive month in December, although there are indications of a sequential bottoming out. In volume terms too, the rate of decline appears to be moderating. While softer petroleum, oil and lubricants (POL) and commodity prices helped to contain the trade deficit, these benign effects were offset by a spike in the quantum of gold and POL imports. As a consequence, the trade deficit widened during December in relation to preceding months, though the overall current account deficit is likely to remain well contained and easily financed. Net foreign direct investment (FDI) and non-resident deposits have remained robust in relation to last year. The persisting decline in oil prices may, however, impact the flow of remittances from the Gulf region where fiscal positions are deteriorating rapidly. Portfolio investment also recorded some outflows since November. Nevertheless, as on January 22, 2016, foreign exchange reserves stood at US$ 347.6 billion _ an accretion of US$ 5.9 billion during the current financial year so far.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Inflation has evolved closely along the trajectory set by the monetary policy stance. With unfavourable base effects on the ebb and benign prices of fruits and vegetables and crude oil, the January 2016 target of 6 per cent should be met. Going forward, under the assumption of a normal monsoon and the current level of international crude oil prices and exchange rates, inflation is expected to be inertial and be around 5 per cent by the end of fiscal 2016-17 (Chart 1). However, the implementation of the VII Central Pay Commission award, which has not been factored into these projections, will impart upward momentum to this trajectory for a period of one to two years. The Reserve Bank will adjust the forecast path as and when more clarity emerges on the timing of implementation. Vagaries in the spatial and temporal distribution of the monsoon and the impact of adverse geo-political events on commodity prices and financial markets add additional uncertainty to the baseline. Prospects for the rabi harvest are improving slowly. The near-term outlook for industrial activity may be constrained by adverse base effects in Q4 and still weak exports, although the pick-up in corporate profitability on the back of declining input costs may provide an offset. Some categories of services are likely to gain momentum on expectations of higher activity in coming months, though the aggregate state of activity remains muted. On balance, therefore, GVA growth for 2015-16 is kept unchanged at 7.4 per cent with a downside bias.For 2016-17, growth is expected to strengthen gradually, notwithstanding significant headwinds. Expectations of a normal monsoon after two consecutive years of rainfall deficiency, the large positive terms of trade gain, improving real incomes of households and lower input costs of firms should contribute to strengthening the growth momentum. Yet, still weak domestic private investment demand in a phase of balance sheet adjustments, re-emergence of concerns relating to stalled projects, excess capacity in industry, sluggish external demand conditions dampening export growth could act as headwinds. Based on an assessment of the balance of risks, GVA growth for 2016-17 is projected at 7.6 per cent (Chart 2).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"In keeping with the Government¡¯s Start-up India initiative, the Reserve Bank will take steps to ease doing business and contribute to an ecosystem that is conducive for growth of start-ups. These measures will create an enabling framework for receiving foreign venture capital, differing contractual structures embedded in investment instruments, deferring receipt of considerations for transfer of ownership, facilities for escrow arrangements and simplification of documentation and reporting procedures. A detailed statement is being issued separately.The current momentum of growth is reasonable, though below what should be expected over the medium term. Underlying growth drivers need to be rekindled to place the economy durably on a higher growth trajectory. The revival of private investment, in particular, has a crucial role, especially as the climate for business improves and fiscal policy continues to consolidate. The Indian economy is currently being viewed as a beacon of stability because of the steady disinflation, a modest current account deficit and commitment to fiscal rectitude. This needs to be maintained so that the foundations of stable and sustainable growth are strengthened. The Reserve Bank continues to be accommodative even as it leaves the policy rate unchanged in this review, while awaiting further data on the development of inflation. Structural reforms in the forthcoming Union Budget that boost growth while controlling spending will create more space for monetary policy to support growth, while also ensuring that inflation remains on the projected path of 5 per cent by the end of 2016-17.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"Since the third bi-monthly statement of August 2015, global growth has moderated, especially in emerging market economies (EMEs), global trade has deteriorated further and downside risks to growth have increased. In the United States, industrial production slowed as capital spending in the energy sector was cut back and exports contracted, weighed down by the strength of the US dollar. Consumer spending stayed buoyant, however, amidst steadily improving labour market conditions. In the Euro area, a fragile recovery strengthened, supported by domestic consumption, less slack in the labour market and improving financial conditions engendered by ultra-accommodative monetary policy. Economic activity in Japan, however, is faltering under the weight of weak private consumption and exports, with both business and consumer confidence subdued. EMEs are caught in a vortex of slowing global trade volumes, depressed commodity prices, weakening currencies and capital outflows, which is accentuating country-specific domestic constraints. China¡¯s intended rebalancing from investment towards consumption is being hit by the stock market meltdown, slower industrial production and weaker exports. The devaluation of the renminbi on August 11, while mild, has unsettled financial markets across the world. Brazil and Russia are grappling with recession and runaway inflation, while South Africa is facing tightening structural constraints which threaten to tip it into a downturn.Since the Chinese devaluation, equity prices, commodities and currencies have fallen sharply. Capital flight from EMEs into mature bond markets has pushed down developed market yields, and risk spreads across asset classes have widened. Although volatility ebbed in early September and capital flows returned cautiously to some EMEs, sentiment in financial markets remains fragile. The September 17 decision of the Federal Open Market Committee to stay on hold in response to global conditions and weak domestic inflation lifted financial markets briefly, but overall financial conditions are yet to stabilise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"In India, a tentative economic recovery is underway, but is still far from robust. In agriculture, sown area has expanded modestly from a year ago, reflecting the timely and robust onset of the monsoon in June, but the southwest monsoon is currently deficient by 14 per cent _ with production-weighted rainfall deficiency at 20 per cent. Nevertheless, the first advance estimates indicate that food grain production is expected to be higher than last year, reflecting actions taken to contain the adverse effects of rain deficiency through timely advisories and regular monitoring of seed and fertiliser availability. Allied farm activities, which are more insulated from the monsoon, remain resilient and could partly offset the effects of adverse weather on crop production. Rural demand, however, remains subdued as reflected in still shrinking tractor and two-wheeler sales.Manufacturing has exhibited uneven growth in April-July, with industrial activity slowing sequentially in July, although it has been in expansionary mode for the ninth month in succession. Industries such as apparel, furniture and motor vehicles have experienced acceleration. Furthermore, the resumption of growth in production of consumer durables in recent months, after a protracted period of contraction over the last two years, is indicative of some pick-up in consumption demand, primarily in urban areas. Since our last review, however, external demand conditions have turned weaker, suggesting a more persistent drag from lower exports and cheaper imports due to global overcapacity. This contributes to continuing domestic capacity under-utilisation, decelerating new orders and a rising ratio of finished goods inventories to sales.As a result of still tepid aggregate demand, output price growth is weak, but input material costs have fallen further, leading to an increase in margins for most producers. Weak aggregate demand appears to have more than offset the effect of higher margins to hold back new investment intentions. The expansion in capital goods production, therefore, likely relates more to the revival of stalled projects than to a build-up of the green field pipeline. Survey-based business sentiment has been falling in recent quarters. The manufacturing purchasing managers¡¯ index (PMI) nevertheless remained in expansion territory in August, although it slowed from July due to weak domestic and export order books.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,financial,"In the services sector, construction activity is weakening as reflected in low demand for cement and the large inventory of unsold residential houses in some localities. Rising public expenditure on roads, ports and eventually railways could, however, provide some boost to construction going forward. Lead indicators relating to freight and passenger traffic are mixed. In August, the services PMI remained in expansion for the second consecutive month on improving new business, but business expectations remain subdued.Headline consumer price index (CPI) inflation reached its lowest level in August since November 2014. The ebbing of inflation in the year so far is due to a combination of low month-on-month increases in prices and favourable base effects. Overall year-on-year food inflation dropped sharply, led by vegetables and sugar. Cereal inflation moderated steadily during April-August, but price pressures in respect of pulses and onions remained elevated.CPI inflation excluding food and fuel eased in August for the second consecutive month, primarily due to the decline in petrol and diesel prices pulling down inflation in transportation. Fares other than for air transport have, however, remained inflexible downwards. Inflation in house rentals increased, but was more than offset by some moderation in the heterogeneous category of services, including education, personal care and effects, and health. Inflation expectations of households remained elevated in double digits likely in response to recent month-on-month increases in the prices of vegetables and pulses. Professional forecasters¡¯ inflation expectations eased as credibility built around the January 2016 inflation target. Rural wage growth remains subdued and corporate staff costs decelerated.Liquidity conditions eased considerably during August to mid-September. In addition to structural factors such as deposit mobilisation in excess of credit flow, lower currency demand and pick-up in spending by the government contributed to the surplus liquidity. In response, the Reserve Bank conducted variable rate reverse repos of overnight and longer tenors ranging from 2 to 20 days. As a result, the average net daily liquidity absorption by the Reserve Bank increased from _120 billion in July to _261 billion in August and further to _544 billion in September (up to September 15). Money market rates generally remained below the repo rate. As quarterly tax collections went out of the system from mid-September, deficit conditions returned and the Reserve Bank engaged in average net injections of the order of _544 billion (September 16 to 27), keeping the call money rate close to the repo rate. Some forms of bank credit such as personal loans grew strongly as did non-bank financing flows through commercial paper, public equity issues and housing finance. With the weakening of growth prospects in EMEs and world trade volume growth falling below world GDP growth, India¡¯s merchandise exports continued to decline in the first two months of Q2. Imports values also declined, but the sharp fall in international crude oil and gold prices was offset by rising import volumes. Non-oil non-gold imports went back into contraction after recording a marginal pick-up in the previous quarter, although there were higher imports of fertilisers, electronics and pulses. With services exports moderating, the widening of the merchandise trade deficit could lead to a modest increase in the current account deficit (CAD) during Q2. Net capital inflows were buoyed by sustained foreign direct investment and accretion to non-resident deposits, and reduced by portfolio outflows, mainly from equity markets. Foreign exchange reserves rose by US $ 10.4 billion during the first half of 2015-16.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other,,"The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere this year is likely to show one of the largest annual rises since measurements began in 1958, partly fuelled by Australian bushfires, according to research by Britain's Met Office.
The concentration of CO2 is expected to peak above 417 parts per million (ppm) this May, while the year's average is expected to be around 414 ppm, up to nearly 3 ppm above the average for last year.
Man-made emissions are the overall driver of the long-term rise in CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere, which is the main cause of climate change.
However, added to that, weather patterns linked to swings in Pacific Ocean temperatures are known to affect the uptake of CO2 by land ecosystems.
In years when there is a warmer tropical Pacific, many regions become warmer and drier, which limits the ability of plants to grow and absorb CO2 and increases the risk of wildfires, which release further emissions.
Along with other weather patterns and human-induced climate change, this has contributed to the recent hot, dry weather in Australia, which played a key role in the severity of bushfires, the Met Office said.
An unusually long bushfire season has scorched an area one-third the size of Germany in Australia.
The impact of weather patterns on ecosystems is expected to increase the rise in CO2 concentration by 10% this year and the emissions from the bushfires contribute up to one fifth of this increase, the Met Office said.
""Although the series of annual levels of CO2 have always seen a year-on-year increase since 1958, driven by fossil fuel burning and deforestation, the rate of rise isn’t perfectly even because there are fluctuations in the response of ecosystem carbon sinks, especially tropical forests,"" said Richard Betts, of the Met Office Hadley Centre
""Overall, these are expected to be weaker than normal for a second year running,"" he added.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
