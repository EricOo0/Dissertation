wildfires,"Australia is currently engulfed with smoke. The wildfires that the country is experiencing at the moment are a result of man-induced global warming.
There have been quite a few human casualties and the bushfires have burned nearly 5 million hectares of land. Australia saw the hottest and driest season this year with the temperature reaching almost 50 degrees celsius in the last month.
The bushfires are also having an extreme effect on the wildlife of Australia. According to reports over 8,000 koalas, which is approximately 30 per cent of the total population in NSW's mid-North Coast region have been lost to fire.
Ecologists from the University of Sydney believe, over 480 million birds, animals and reptiles have already been lost because of the fires.
Netizens have also taken to the internet to share images and videos of the bushfires to show the world what exactly is happening in Australia and it is a heart-breaking sight."
other,"At least five people were killed and eight more are still missing following a deadly volcanic eruption on New Zealand's White Island Monday. The country's Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, said citizens from New Zealand, Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, China and Malaysia were among those injured and missing following the explosion. Speaking at a news conference on Tuesday morning, local time, Ardern paid tribute to the people who tried to help visitors caught up in the eruption. ""Those who undertook a risky effort in the immediate aftermath did so in an incredibly courageous way,"" she said. According to New Zealand Police Superintendent Bruce Bird, 47 people were on the island at the time of the explosion. He said 31 are still in hospital, while three others have been treated and discharged. The eruption took place with little warning Monday afternoon local time while dozens of tourists from cruise ship Ovation of the Seas were touring the volcano."
earthquake,"An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.9 has shaken southern Peru, leaving nearly two dozen people injured.
The U.S. Geological Survey says Friday's quake was centered 52 kilometers from the coastal city of Ica and was registered at a depth of 15 kilometers.
The Reuters news agency reports the quake shook buildings in Peru's capital, Lima. Officials in Ica say 20 people have been treated at the hospital. Their injuries have been described as non life-threatening.
In 2007, a massive 8.0-magnitude earthquake along Peru's central coast killed at least 540 people and left thousands homeless.  Peru lies near the boundary of two tectonic plates, making the region vulnerable to earthquakes."
Typhoon,"Hundreds of people have been rescued after Hurricane Sally _ which has since transformed into a tropical storm _ made landfall in Alabama and Florida on Wednesday morning.
The storm arrived as a Category 2 hurricane in Gulf Shores, Alabama, around 4.45am with 105mph winds and rain depths in the feet, not inches, flooding homes and streets _ as people were forced to evacuate from the southern coast.
Some areas have already been hit with 24 inches of rain, and a total of 35 inches could come in parts of Florida and Alabama, according to the National Weather Service. Why specific areas were getting hammered with high rains was due, in part, to how slowly the storm was moving. It was traveling at just 7mph up the coastal states.
First responders used boats and high water vehicles in parts of Florida and Alabama to rescue hundreds of trapped residents while Hurricane Sally transformed into a tropical storm, with winds decreasing to 70mph.
The rescues came after some of the areas hit the hardest were not issued mandatory evacuations. Residents were encouraged to voluntarily leave, but some people still stayed behind in their homes.
“At one point we were grabbing things to evacuate because the water was starting to get up to the second level and then by that point it was too late for us to go anywhere,"" Kirsten Colla, who lives in a townhouse on Escambia Bay in Pensacola, Florida, told weather.com."
Typhoon,"At least 20 people have been killed and 50 others missing in Japan after the country's western coast was hit by typhoon Talas on Sunday.
The typhoon has unleashed heavy rains, triggering landslides, and is slowly moving north. The government has ordered evacuation of 460,000 people in western and central Japan. Hundreds of people are still stranded as the rescue efforts are being hampered by flooded rivers and collapsed bridges, local agencies report.
The typhoon has caused record amount of rainfall in some areas, making it the worst storm to hit the country since 2004.
Talas has damaged Nijojo castle, designated as an important cultural treasure and a popular tourist attraction in the ancient city of Kyoto.
Public broadcaster NHK showed a bridge swept away after torrential rain. People holding umbrellas waded through knee-deep water in city streets and residential areas. Many cars were washed away in the floods.
Japan's meteorological agency warned of more heavy rains, strong winds, floods and landslides. It has issued landslide warnings in nearly all of the country's prefectures."
earthquake,"On 15 January 2021, a 6.2 magnitude earthquake hit Majene, West Sulawesi Province in the early hours of the morning killing at least 81?people, injuring more than 630, and over 15,000 homeless.
More than 15,000 people have been temporarily displaced in 15 IDP sites, and figures are increasing.
The quake severely damaged buildings and houses, including a hospital that was completely flattened, trapping dozens of patients and staff in the rubble. Preliminary assessments indicate that 17 schools have been damaged.
Heavy rains in recent days have made access very difficult, blocking the main road to the affected areas.
The first priority is to search for survivors who have been trapped under the rubble, and to tend to the wounded.
This disaster comes nearly two and a half years after a massive earthquake and tsunami killed thousands in Central Sulawesi. Indonesia sits within the Pacific Ring of Fire, the world’s most disaster-prone area marked by floods, tsunamis and earthquakes."
wildfires,"A wildfire in the Mark Twain National Forest just west of the Bixby/Viburnum area was 40 percent contained as of 4 p.m. Friday afternoon. The fire has already consumed more than 450 acres according to the U.S. Forest Service.
The fire was called in at about 10:15 a.m. Thursday and fire fighters arrived on the scene by 11 a.m. Additional fire departments were called to help battle the blaze, which started at the intersection of Iron County Road 73 and Highway 32. The fire continued to move east on Highway 32 throughout the night and into Friday morning.
Increased winds from the southeast pushed the fire over Highway 32 where another section of land, just west of Council Bluff Lake, was devastated, forcing the highway’s closure. It has been closed from highway 49 south to Route A.
Council Bluffs campground is still open as of press time, but may be difficult to get to, and the campground could be closed if it becomes necessary.
""What is really driving this fire is low humidity and high temperatures. This creates a situation where the fire is actually pushing itself. It is essentially creating its own wind. This is a situation we see often out west, such as in the Colorado Fires, but not usually in Missouri,"" said Susan Zornek-Stevens, U.S Forest Service Public Information Officer.
There were some residential structures within a mile of the fire, but no residents had been evacuated as of press time. Officials say they will take that precaution if the fire spreads any closer to those homes.
Jody Eberly with the Mark Twain National Forest said things are so dry, the fires are getting into the tops of the trees as well.
She is cautioning people to be extra careful. With conditions this dry, even throwing a cigarette out of a car window or on the ground from the sidewalk can quickly start a large fire that could endanger many homes and lives.
At press time officials have not determined the exact nature of the blaze, but say it was likely set by a careless motorist. The Forest Service implores residents to be cautious during these severe drought conditions."
Typhoon,"Gonzalo a hurricane risk to Caribbean (maybe US), Hanna a rainfall risk to Texas Two tropical storms, Gonzalo and Hanna, each of which has broken records as the earliest seventh and eighth named storms to form of the Atlantic tropical storm and hurricane season, are threatening impacts in the coming days. The 2020 Atlantic hurricane season is following true to forecasts for a very active season in terms of number of storms, as it is currently running ahead of records. Of course, these forecasts for high levels of activity do not necessarily mean high levels of insurance and reinsurance market losses, as it is landfalls that matter, in highly urbanised locations by strong storms and hurricanes. Tropical storm Gonzalo is forecast to become hurricane Gonzalo in the coming day or so, as it tracks towards the southern Caribbean windward islands. Gonzalo was the earliest seventh named storm of a tropical season and is now heading for the Caribbean with sustained winds of over 60mph and higher gusts. Expected to reach hurricane status, Gonzalo could then weaken slightly and head into the eastern Caribbean Sea, before then regaining strength on its passage northwest. Gonzalo is a relatively small tropical storm, with tropical-storm-force winds only extending outward up to 25 miles from the centre, which should save some islands from as strong a hit as it passes. Once through the Caribbean Gonzalo could enter the Gulf of Mexico and while there is significant uncertainty in precisely where the storm will track to, a U.S. Gulf Coast landfall is in the forecast for certain model runs. The below is taken from TropicalTidbits.com and shows a GFS model run for storm Gonzalo."

The eruption of Mount Nyiragongo on Saturday night sent about 5,000 people fleeing from the city of Goma across the nearby border into Rwanda, while another 25,000 others sought refuge to the northwest in Sake, the U.N. children’s agency said Sunday. More than 170 children were still feared missing Sunday and UNICEF officials said they were organizing transit centers to help unaccompanied children in the wake of the disaster."
Typhoon,"Hundreds of trees were felled and power supply cut as the storm struck, state media said.
The typhoon left a trail of damage in South Korea, killing 15 people and leaving almost two million temporarily without power.
A search is continuing off Jeju island for 10 Chinese fishermen still missing in the wake of the storm.
Two boats capsized early on Tuesday as the typhoon hit the island, which is south of the Korean peninsula.
South Korean coast guards managed to rescue 12 people and another six swam ashore. But five were killed and the whereabouts of the remaining 10 crew members is unknown.
Across the country 10 South Koreans were killed and another two injured, Yonhap news agency reported."

drought,"Arizona is getting a jump start on what will be a yearslong process to address a dwindling but key water source in the U.S. West.
Several states and Mexico rely on the Colorado River for drinking water and growing crops. But climate change, drought and demand have taken a toll on the river that no longer can deliver what was promised in the 1920s.
Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, California, Utah, Wyoming and Nevada have been operating under a set of guidelines approved in 2007. Those guidelines and an overlapping drought contingency plan will expire in 2026.
Arizona water officials gathered Thursday to outline a plan for what comes next. Other states in the river basin have had more informal discussions.
“Hold on to your seats because the reconsultation will be technical and complicated, and it will take a long time,” said Ted Cooke, general manager of the Central Arizona Project, who is co-chairing Arizona’s effort.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation is reviewing the effectiveness of the 2007 guidelines that address shortages and surpluses of water, and efforts to conserve water in Lake Mead along the Nevada-Arizona border. A draft is expected in August, and a final report in December.
“It’s prudent water management to review how well something has worked before determining what might replace it,” said Carly Jerla of the Bureau of Reclamation.
When those guidelines went into effect, the river had been in drought conditions for several years. It hasn’t let up. A drought contingency plan approved by the Western states last year was meant as a stop-gap. It requires Arizona, Nevada and Mexico to prop up Lake Mead earlier than under the 2007 guidelines. It also looped in California for water cuts.
A Reclamation audit published last month found that water use in the Colorado River’s lower basin dropped by more than 575,000 acre-feet from 2018 to 2019, a level not seen since 1986. That allowed Lake Mead and Lake Powell — key indicators of the river’s health — to increase by several feet but both remain well below capacity.
As of this week, Mead was 41% full. Powell, along the Arizona-Utah line, was 53% full.
Arizona is looking to build upon the work done on the drought contingency plan. The committee of about three dozen people that worked it helps develop what might replace the existing guidelines, focusing on how to sustain the river while meeting the state’s water needs, officials said."
wildfires,"Some residents cried as they walked through the rubble of their homes while others shared amazing stories of survival as more people returned to their houses Tuesday and surveyed the twisted metal and smoking ruins left behind by a devastating California wildfire.
Gary Herrin sobbed as he walked through what had been his childhood home in Middletown.
""Yep, grew up here, was able to walk to school from here. Many friends lived close by,"" Herrin recalled, looking around. ""There's a lot of good people here, but it's a ghost town now, it's really eerie.”
His brother had been living in the home and members of his extended family resided nearby.
""I go to my brother-in-law's house, my niece's house, and there's nothing, nothing, ashes,"" Herrin said.
A number of people saw the devastation for the first time since the massive flames sped Saturday through rural Lake County, less than 160 kilometres north of San Francisco.
Aided by drought, it has consumed more than 269 square kilometres and was 30 per cent contained.
Fire investigators working to determine what caused the massive blaze have narrowed their focus to an area in the community of Cobb, where the blaze was first spotted, said California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokesman Daniel Berlant.
What sparked the blaze remains under investigation, he said.
Authorities say 585 homes were known to be destroyed, and the number was expected to increase. Another 9,000 structures remained threatened.
The Lake County fire and another blaze about 193 kilometres to the southeast have displaced 23,000 people and were the worst of a dozen wildfires burning in the state. The Lake County fire spread into northern Napa County, but the region's famous wine valley was not threatened.
Rancher Lisa Comstock said she and her three dogs survived the raging fire in rural Middletown by jumping into a water trough as flames neared her home."
earthquake,"Many residents of the Southern Zone didn’t need an alarm to wake up early on Friday morning.
A magnitude 6.0 earthquake shook southern Costa Rica and northern Panama at 6:41 a.m., the Volcanological and Seismological Observatory of Costa Rica (OVSICORI) said.
The epicenter was estimated at 37.6 km southwest of Puerto Armuelles, Panama.
The National Emergency Commission (CNE) has not reported any damages in Costa Rica. The earthquake was felt throughout the Southern Zone and in the city of David, Panama, OVSICORI said.
“This is an earthquake that occurs in a region where three tectonic plates interact: the Cocos plate, the Nazca plate, and the Panama plate,” an OVSICORI spokesperson said.
OVSICORI reported several smaller aftershocks throughout Friday morning.
Costa Rica averages 350 earthquakes each month — about 12 each day — though most are imperceptible."
drought,"A potent combination of record-breaking heat and a lack of rain has led to the rapid development of drought across the southeastern United States and Tennessee and Ohio Valleys during September 2019. Coming off an extremely wet 2018 east of the Rockies, the fast onset of widespread extensive drought has been quite the climate whiplash for millions across the Southeast.  With warmer than average temperatures expected to continue and October being a generally dry month based on climatology, drought conditions are likely to continue and possibly expand and intensify over the next week.
The extent to which drought has overtaken the southeastern United States by the end of September would have been hard to explain to residents of the region just a month prior.  While a few localized areas in Georgia/Alabama were already mired in drought, the broader region extending into the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys was drought free. In fact, the twelve-month period (September 2018-August 2019) coming to an end was record wet. But then, while it continued to be hot, things turned incredibly dry.
The rapid onset and severity of the event qualified it as a “Flash drought.” Generally, droughts are caused by a lack of precipitation over an extended period of time. In contrast, a flash drought is preceded not just by a lack of rain, but also very high temperatures and/or lots of sunny days. Even if the dry period is not especially severe, the latter two can suck moisture from the ground quickly.
For operational purposes, NOAA National Weather Service’s Climate Prediction Center defines a flash drought as an event during which an area experiences degradation by two or more drought categories in a four week period, based on the U.S. Drought Monitor."
earthquake,"Earthquake in Turkey-Iran border region kills nine, injures more than 100 ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Nine people were killed and buildings collapsed across southeastern Turkey on Sunday when a magnitude 5.7 earthquake struck near the border with Iran, injuring more than a hundred in villages and towns in both countries, government officials said. In Turkey, three of the dead were children, and 50 people were injured, including nine critically, the health ministry said. The shallow tremor caused more than 1,000 buildings to collapse in Turkey, prompting a brief rescue effort to find those trapped under rubble. The quake damaged buildings some 90 km (56 miles) to the west in the Turkish city of Van, and to the east in dozens of villages in Iran, where state TV said 75 people were injured including six in hospital. There were several aftershocks including a larger tremor measuring 6.0 magnitude that stuck nearby 10 hours later. There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties from that quake, which was also fairly shallow and potentially dangerous. Crisscrossed by major fault lines, Iran and Turkey are among the most earthquake-prone countries in the world."
earthquake,"Death toll soars to 36 in eastern Turkey earthquake ISTANBUL, Jan. 26 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from a strong earthquake that rocked eastern Turkey on Friday has risen to 36, with 1,607 people injured, the Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) reported on Sunday. A total of 45 people were rescued from ruins, and search and rescue operations are still going on in the debris of one building at the city center, the AFAD said in an updated statement. The earthquake occurred at 8:55 p.m. local time (1755 GMT) in the province of Elazig at a depth of 6.75 km and was followed by 788 aftershocks, according to the statement. The analysis of a total of 1,521 constructions in both Elazig and the nearby province of Malatya by experts revealed that at least 76 buildings were fully wrecked, and 645 others were severely damaged, the AFAD added. Earlier in the day, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the problems were mostly in the villages of Elazig. ""We will detect the scope of the damage there and launch the construction works quickly,"" he told reporters in Istanbul before departing for Algeria. The AFAD statement also said that some 10,000 tents suitable for families were shipped to the region, and more than 4,200 of them were installed in line with the demand in the field. The agency also shared a couple of bank details on its website for those citizens who want to donate money for the earthquake survivors."
earthquake,"The biggest earthquake to hit Japan in 140 years struck the northeast coast on Friday, triggering a 10-meter tsunami that swept away everything in its path, including houses, cars and farm buildings on fire, media and witnesses said.
At least one person was killed in Fukushima prefecture, north of Tokyo where four million homes were without power. The 8.9 magnitude quake caused many injuries, public broadcaster NHK said, sparked fires and the wall of water, prompting warnings to people to move to higher ground in coastal areas.
The Philippines, Taiwan and Indonesia all issued tsunami alerts, reviving memories of the giant tsunami which struck Asia in 2004. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued alerts for countries as far away as Colombia and Peru.
There were several strong aftershocks. In the capital Tokyo, buildings shook violently. An oil refinery near Tokyo was on fire, with dozens of storage tanks under threat."
Typhoon,"Inhabitants of the Korean peninsula are cleaning up after one powerful typhoon and preparing for another that could be particularly damaging to North Korea, which is still recovering from earlier floods.
The first storm, typhoon Bolaven, left at least 12 people dead in South Korea, including eight fishermen killed in wrecks off the southern coast. The extent of the damage in North Korea, which was hit late on Tuesday and early on Wednesday, was not completely clear, although state media reported that the storm knocked out power, submerged roads and houses and ruined farmland.
Typhoon Tembin was expected to reach South Korea on Thursday, with its outer bands hitting North Korea later in the day.
Tembin is expected to weaken as it reaches North Korea. Heavy rain, however, often means catastrophe in the north because of poor drainage, deforestation and decrepit infrastructure. The north's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said some areas of Hwanghae and Kangwon provinces would receive up to 70mm (2.8in) of rain on Thursday and Friday."
drought,"The latest famine in Somalia has put a spotlight on the urgent need to develop national and regional drought policies, according to the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, which are jointly leading the international action to address the growing impact of droughts.
Drought is expected to continue in hard-hit southern Somalia during August and September, as well as parts of Ethiopia, Djibouti and Kenya, according to the latest WMO Climate Outlook Forum for the region, which provides regional climate forecasts. The IGAD Climate Prediction and Applications Centre (ICPAC) already called for preparedness for an ongoing long period of drought over parts of the equatorial region in its climate update for the Greater Horn of Africa on 15 January 2011.
Droughts have become more common over the past two decades. This is consistent with reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, stating that the world has become more drought-prone over the last 25 years, and will see an increased frequency of droughts in the future.
""Droughts do not happen overnight,"" said Luc Gnacadja, Executive Secretary of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), responding to the declaration of famine by the United Nations earlier this month. ""The UNCCD joins the calls on the international community to respond urgently to this crisis. At the same time, we stress the need for effective, long-term solutions to the root causes of famine in drought-prone regions, such as implementation of drought management systems and measures to stop desertification, which means land degradation in drylands.""
""We are moving forward quickly to provide integrated drought information to help decision-makers deal with drought, such as the one underway right now in East Africa,"" said Michel Jarraud, Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization. ""Drought is a serious and growing problem in many countries. Adaptation to drought, desertification and climate change urgently needs to be mainstreamed in national development policies.""
Mr Gnacadja visited Mr Jarraud at WMO earlier this month to discuss cooperation between the two organizations, following the UN declaration of famine for two provinces in southern Somalia on 13 July 2011. The two organizations have a long-standing partnership. Most recently they have championed the use of the Standard Precipitation Index, as a universal meteorological drought index to improve monitoring and climate risk management among countries."
Typhoon,"The US Midwest will be hit with blizzards and gale-force winds this week, forecasters have said, as a powerful storm threatens to trigger more flooding in the region.
High spring temperatures are today expected to give way to heavy snow and life-threatening conditions across a swath of the central US.
Patrick Burke, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service (NWS), warned that the storm could cause widespread power outages and road closures.
“This is potentially a life-threatening storm,” he told Reuters. “It’s slow moving. It won’t push farther east until Friday.”
The storm has already sparked flood evacuations in Oregon and caused flooding in Washington state.
Some areas of western Minnesota and southeast South Dakota are likely to experience up to 30 inches snow.
The same region is still recovering from last month’s ‘bomb cyclone’ which brought deadly flooding and blizzards, causing billions of dollars in damage.
The NWS said that the coming storm is likely to exacerbate flooding along the Missouri River in areas where dozens of levees were breached in March.
The storm is expected to weaken and push off into the Great Lakes area and northern Michigan on Friday, bringing more rain and snow, forecasters said."

""This morning, after lava flows from Nyiragongo volcano have stopped, most of Congolese evacuated to Rubavu are returning back home,"" the ministry said."
wildfires,"Experts fear that a sharp drought and ongoing deforestation could trigger a repeat of the large fires of August 2019. Government efforts implemented in May to stop fires don’t appear to have been effective.
The number of forest fires in Brazil's Amazon rainforest increased 28% in July in comparison to last year, the country's National Institute for Space Research reported Saturday.
Brazil holds around 60% of the Amazon basin region and environmentalists say this area is vital to containing the impact of climate change.
The state agency recorded 6,803 fires in the Amazon last month, compared to 5,318 in the same month of 2019.
Environmentalists were alarmed by the figure, particularly because August traditionally marks the beginning of the fire season in the region. Many now fear that a repeat of the large surge in fires that devastated the area last August could occur this year again.
 ""More than 1,000 fires in a single day is a 15-year record and shows the government's strategy of media-spectacle operations is not working on the ground,"" Greenpeace spokesman Romulo Batista said in a statement.
The fires have been largely set to clear land illegally for farming, ranching and mining. Activists accuse Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro of encouraging the deforestation, as he has been in favor of opening up the rainforest to agriculture and industry.
The first six months of 2020 were already the worst on record for deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, with 3,069 square kilometers (1,185 square miles) cleared, according to INPE data, an area larger than the nation of Luxembourg."
earthquake,"A magnitude-7.0 earthquake occurred in the far southern Philippine Sea off the coast of southeastern Mindano region of the Philippines. The epicenter was approximately 210 km (130 miles) southeast of Pondaguitan, Philippines. The tremor occurred at a depth of about 95.8 km (59.5 miles), and moderate-to-strong shaking was probably felt in the Philippine Sea near the epicenter. Weak-to-light shaking was probably felt in far southeastern Mindanao region. There have been no initial reports of damage or casualties as a result of the earthquake; however, significant damage is unlikely in the Philippines due to the depth and location of this event. It could take several hours until authorities can conduct comprehensive damage assessments, especially in remote areas. Aftershocks are likely over the coming days. The event has not prompted any tsunami advisories.Officials may temporarily shut down transportation infrastructure in the tremor zone to check for damage. Minor disruptions could occur during shutdowns, but service will likely resume quickly if no damage is found. Utility outages are possible, particularly near the earthquake's epicenter."
wildfires,"Several small fires have sparked in the Payette National Forest in the last few days, according to forest service officials.
Meanwhile, a handful of other major fires continue to burn in west-central Idaho in parts of the Salmon-Challis National Forest, along with the Franch Church River of No Return Wilderness.
Firefighters report two fires in the Krassel Ranger District have burned about one-quarter of an acre each over the weekend. The Day Off Fire is located 3 miles east of Krassel Work Station. The Rainbow Fire is 5 miles northeast of Yellowpine. Both are expected to be contained by Sunday.
The quarter-acre Blue Fire started east of the Snake River near Council and has been contained.
Firefighters say several spot fires in the McCall Ranger District near Johnson Creek were similarly contained."
Typhoon,"Another busy hurricane season appears likely, although it won’t be as bad as last year, according to a prediction released Wednesday by AccuWeather, a private weather forecasting service.
The prediction calls for seven to 10 hurricanes. Three to five of these are expected to reach major hurricane strength, which means winds of at least 111 mph.
“Current indications are this will be another above-normal season,” said Dan Kottlowski, AccuWeather’s lead hurricane forecaster. “This can translate into high impacts on the United States.”
The season still is unlikely to be as busy as last year’s record-breaking season, which generated 30 storms, including 13 hurricanes, subjecting the United States to 12 direct hits and exhausting the storm names selected for that year.
But the danger to the U.S. east coast may be higher this year because of the weakening of the Bermuda high, a high-pressure zone that last year stiff-armed many storms into the Gulf of Mexico. This year, the Bermuda high’s rim could be farther northeast, allowing storms to curve north earlier and strike the east coast.
The Accu-Weather forecast cited warm Atlantic temperatures as one factor in the prediction of an active season.
Hurricane season officially starts June 1, although there’s been discussion of shifting the date into May, since the past few years have produced several pre-season storms."

The quake occurred at 4:33 a.m. today (July 22). Earthquakes Canada measured it as a 5.1-magnitude quake, while the U.S. Geological Survey assessed it as a 5.4-magnitude quake. According to Earthquakes Canada, the epicentre, at a depth of eight kilometres (five miles), was located 220 kilometres (138 miles) southwest of Port Alice, 326 kilometres (203 miles) southwest of Campbell River, 443 kilometres (275 miles) west of Victoria, and 458 kilometres (285 miles) west of Vancouver."
Typhoon,"At least 13 people were killed and over 50 missing, with nearly 20,000 people ordered to evacuate and hundreds of flights cancelled as Typhoon Wipha pummelled Japan’s Pacific coast on Wednesday, leaving piles of wreckage on one small island but largely sparing the capital Tokyo.
Operators of the wrecked Fukushima nuclear power plant north of Tokyo pumped rainwater out of protective containers at the base of some 1,000 tanks storing radioactive water, and were taking other precautions, as the typhoon brushed past Tokyo and moved up the coastline.
Television footage showed roads clogged with heaps of wreckage and houses with gaping holes.
“I heard a crackling sound and then the trees on the hillside all fell over,” a woman on Oshima island told NHK national television. “Then mud slid as far as the house.”
The storm brought hurricane-force winds and drenching rain to the metropolis of 30 million people at the peak of the morning rush hour, halting some train services. Other trains operated at partial capacity.
The storm, which was picking up speed as it moved north, was 170 km (105 miles) south of the city of Miyako and moving north northeast at 75 kph (47 mph) at 11am (0200 GMT), according to the Japan Meteorological Agency’s website.
It carried sustained winds at its centre of 126 kph (78 mph) and gusts up to 180 kph (112 mph) and was expected to weaken into a tropical depression later on Wednesday.
Over 500 flights at Tokyo’s Haneda and Narita airports were cancelled, and several subway lines in the city stopped running due to the high winds. Thousands of schools closed as a precaution.
The typhoon passed close to the crippled Fukushima plant, 220 km (130 miles) north of Tokyo, shortly before noon.
The operator of the plant, Tokyo Electric Power Corp , which has been struggling to contain radioactive leaks, said it would cancel all offshore work and would decide whether to continue work onshore after assessing the weather.
It was pumping out rainwater at the tanks storing radioactive water, a by-product of a jerry-rigged cooling system designed to control reactors wrecked in a 2011 earthquake and tsunami.
The rainwater will be pumped into an empty tank, checked for radioactivity and, if uncontaminated, released into the sea, the company said.
Nissan Motor Co cancelled the Wednesday morning shift at its Oppama and Yokohama plants south of Tokyo and said it was waiting to decide what to do about later shifts. Oppama makes the all-electric Leaf and other models.
Typhoon Wipha is the strongest storm to approach eastern Japan since October 2004. The cyclone that year triggered floods and landslides that killed almost 100 people, forced thousands from their homes and caused billions of dollars in damage."

The earthquake was centered in the Pacific Ocean about 60 miles southeast of Perryville on the sparsely populated Alaska Peninsula, striking around 10:12 p.m. local time (2:12 a.m. Wednesday ET).
The Alaska Peninsula protrudes from mainland Alaska and is flanked to the southwest by the Aleutian Islands.
Reports of significant damage, if any, weren't immediately available. A tsunami warning initially was issued for south Alaska and the Alaska Peninsula, but was canceled by early Wednesday, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The warning sent people to higher ground in cities like Sand Point, an island community of about 1,000 people off the peninsula, the Anchorage Daily News reported.
People in Sand Point gathered at a high school until shortly after midnight, when officials gave an all-clear, Jordan Keeler, an Anchorage-based city administrator, told the newspaper.
""The first wave didn't materialize, which is a great thing,"" Keeler, who was in contact with staff in Sand Point, told the Anchorage Daily News. No reports of major structural damage were made on the island, Keeler told the newspaper.
""We've canceled the (tsunami) advisories because it doesn't look like it's becoming a large wave or any larger,"" National Tsunami Warning Center Director James Gridley said, according to CNN affiliate KTUU.
Strong shaking was reported on the peninsula, the USGS said. Light to weak shaking was reported around Kodiak, about 300 miles northeast of the quake's center, and in Anchorage, some 530 miles from the center, according to the USGS.
In Kodiak, a city of about 6,000 people, a long line of cars headed up a mountain after residents learned of the tsunami warning late Tuesday, John Cannon told KTUU.
Police were ""trying to clear the lower areas down by the harbor,"" he said.
""You (could) hear the tsunami alarms. It's rather eerie,"" he told KTUU.
This quake's depth was 28 kilometers, or 17 miles, the USGS said -- relatively shallow.
""Anything below 70 kilometers is considered a shallow quake,"" CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar said. ""That's important, because shallow earthquakes often cause the most damage, compared to the ones that are deeper, regardless of the strength.""
More than 20 aftershocks followed the quake late Tuesday to early Wednesday, ranging from magnitudes of 2.8 to 6.1."
earthquake,"SANTIAGO, Chile — A strong earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.8 struck off the coast of northern Chile in the first minutes of Tuesday, the U.S. Geological Survey said.
There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage and the Chilean navy said there was no possibility of a tsunami.
The quake occurred at 12:09 a.m. local time at a depth of 35 kilometers (22 miles). It was centered 78 kilometers (48 miles) northeast of the Atacama city of Vallenar. A few minutes later, a second quake occurred with a preliminary magnitude of 6.3.
The quake was felt as far south as the capital, Santiago, and in Antofagasta, 1,330 kilometers (826 miles) further north.
Video from the scene showed windows rattling and items falling to the ground. Local radio stations reported that boulders broke off hills. The electricity was briefly cut off.
Chile is located in the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire and often experiences large earthquake. The last major quake, on Feb. 27, 2010, set off tsunamis and killed 526 people."
Typhoon,"Heavy rain and howling winds are lashing the northern Philippines and Taiwan as Typhoon Usagi goes through the Luzon Strait which divides them.
Villages have been evacuated, ferries suspended and flights cancelled.
Meteorologists say the storm is the most powerful this year and will bring a cumulative rainfall of 1,000mm (39in) as it heads towards China.
The authorities there have announced a red alert ahead of the expected arrival of the storm on Monday.
The US Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Centre said on Friday that Usagi was packing sustained winds of 240 km/h (150 mph), with gusts of up to 296 km/h (185mph), making it the equivalent of a strong category four Atlantic hurricane.
Taiwan is reported to have deployed more than 1,600 soldiers in ""high risk"" areas prone to flooding and landslides while placing 24,000 others on standby.
Authorities in the Philippines are reported to have evacuated nearly 250 people in the northern agricultural province of Tarlac, while ferries are restricted to their ports.
There are particular concerns about the impact of the storm on the Batanes islands in the north of the Philippines, with warnings that large trees could be uprooted, plantations flattened and power and communications severely disrupted by flash flooding, landslides and storm surges."
wildfires,"The number of wildfires and acres burned in Alaska in June 2015 has exceeded what the state saw during the same month in 2004, a year considered the worst for wildfires in the state.
According to the Alaska DNR - Division of Forestry, a combined 1.6 million acres have been burned by 399 separate fires in the state this month through June 29. That is nearly double the number of fires in June 2004, which had 215 wildfires that charred 1.15 million acres.
The Associated Press reported that 314 wildfires remained active over more than 2,265 square miles as of Monday. No new evacuations occurred this past weekend, however residents in some small communities left in voluntary evacuations last week, including elders, children and those that were medically vulnerable.
Most of the fires in June 2004 were located in Alaska's interior, while this June they have been scattered throughout the state, Alaska DNR said. They added that it was unusual to have this concentration of fire starts.
Lightning strikes were a major contributor to the ignition of wildfires in both June 2015 and June 2004. However, Alaska DNR says that June 2015 has had much more lightning than June 2004. In a span of three days from June 21-23, 2015, about 50,000 lightning strikes were recorded across the state.
The largest wildfire in the state is the Iditarod River Fire, which had burned 98,183 acres through June 28. That wildfire and the other top 10 largest wildfires in Alaska through June 28 were all started by lightning strikes."
earthquake,"A series of massive earthquakes have struck north-east Japan, unleashing a 10-metre tsunami that swept buildings, vehicles, crops and debris across swaths of farmland.
The first 8.9 magnitude shock is said to be the biggest to have hit Japan in 140 years, rocking buildings 235 miles (380km) away in Tokyo and sparking fires.
At least five people are known to have died, but amid widespread reports of landslides, floods, collapsed buildings and fires, the death toll is expected to rise.
The quake hit at 2.46pm (5.45am GMT), about 6 miles below sea level and 78 miles off the east coast. It was swiftly followed by five powerful aftershocks of up to 7.1 magnitude. In Tokyo people screamed and grabbed each other's hands as the quake struck. The shock was so powerful it was felt as far away as Beijing."

Before-and-after photos from some of the worst-affected areas show the extent of the damage.
Everything on the tiny island of Barbuda, which has a population of around 1,600, was razed to the ground.
“Barbuda is literally rubble. The entire housing stock was damaged. It is just a total devastation,” Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne told local news station ABS.
The hurricane is making its way towards Florida, which is on high alert and has ordered mandatory evacuations.

drought,"Major cities across Turkey face running out of water in the next few months, with warnings Istanbul has less than 45 days of water left.
Poor rainfall has led to the country’s most severe drought in a decade and left the megacity of 17 million people with critically low levels of water, according to Turkey’s chamber of chemical engineers. The Ankara mayor, Mansur Yava?, said earlier this month the capital had another 110 days’ worth in dams and reservoirs.
?zmir and Bursa, Turkey’s next two biggest cities, are also struggling, with dams that are about 36% and 24% full respectively, and farmers in wheat-producing areas such as the Konya plain and Edirne province on the border with Greece and Bulgaria are warning of crop failure.
The acute lack of rainfall in the second half of 2020 _ approaching 50% year on year for November _ led the religious affairs directorate to instruct imams and their congregations to pray for rain last month.
Turkey is a “water stressed” country, with just 1,346 cubic metres of water per capita per year, and has faced several droughts since the 1980s due to a combination of population growth, industrialisation, urban sprawl and climate change.
“Instead of focusing on measures to keep water demand under control, Turkey insists on expanding its water supply through building more dams  Turkey has built hundreds of dams in the last two decades,” said Dr Akgün ?lhan, a water management expert at the Istanbul Policy Center.
“The warning signs have been there for decades but not much has been done in practice.”
Turkey has long prioritised economic growth over environmental concerns and remains the only G20 country apart from the US yet to ratify the 2015 Paris agreement."

Financial markets, government offices and some schools reopened after being closed by the typhoon, and train services resumed after power supplies were restored in the capital. However, some flights were again cancelled on Wednesday."
drought,"A severe drought is threatening South Africa's wildlife industry, with game farmers keeping fewer animals and tourists visiting game lodges in smaller numbers.
Parts of the country have been affected by consecutive years of abnormally hot weather and below average rainfall that have scorched grazing lands and dried up watering holes since 2015, the driest year on record.
Industry body Wildlife Ranching South Africa (WRSA) estimates the Northern Cape province has lost more than two-thirds of its game over the last three years.
It is conducting a countrywide survey to determine the scale of animal losses and the financial impact on the country's more than 9,000 wildlife ranches.
“It's been an extraordinary drought,” said WRSA chief Adri Kitshoff-Botha. “It's not a one-year or two-year drought. In some areas we've seen it has been going now for six years.”
The wildlife industry generates revenue for South Africa through tourism, hunting, breeding and meat production.
Trophy hunting alone generated 2bn rand (£106m) in 2016, according to research carried out for the environment ministry.
Southern Africa's temperatures are rising at twice the global average rate, according to the International Panel on Climate Change, and in much of South Africa the level of water in reservoirs is dwindling.
For Burger Schoeman, manager at Northern Cape game farm Thuru Lodge, the withered vegetation and parched ground are a serious concern for the sector.
Once home to around 4,500 wild animals _ including 35 different species, from antelope to rhino _ the lodge has lost around 1,000 animals due to drought. Carcasses are piling up in abandoned mines on the edge of the property.
“At this stage we are quite stretched. All the money you get from selling the animals, meat and all of that, gets put straight back into the property to look after the rest of the animals,” Mr Schoeman said."

earthquake,"A powerful earthquake of 6.4 magnitude killed at least six people as it tore down buildings in central Croatia today, as rescuers combed toppled roofs and rubble in the dark.
The tremors were felt as far afield as Vienna while the damage was concentrated in and around Petrinja, a town some 50 kilometres south of Croatia's capital Zagreb. 
Rescuers tried to pull people from the rubble of collapsed buildings, television footage showed, and army troops were sent in to the area to help.
As rescue teams shovelled away bricks and other debris, some elderly residents gathered in a park in downtown Petrinja, wrapped in blankets and afraid to return home. 
""All the tiles in the bathroom are broken, all the dishes fell out"", Marica Pavlovic, a 72-year-old retired meat factory worker, told AFP of the damage to her home.  
""Even if we wanted to, we can't go back in, there is no electricity."" 
The GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences said the quake hit at a depth of 10km. The epicentre was in the town of Petrinja, 50km south of the Croatian capital Zagreb.

Its shares had soared by almost 50% in Thursday's pre-market trade after the Wall Street Journal report.
Since making its US market debut a month ago the company has been targeted by authorities in Beijing.
Meanwhile, some US senators have called on its financial markets regulator to investigate Chinese share listings.
""The rumors about the privatization of Didi are untrue, and the company is currently actively cooperating with cybersecurity reviews,"" the company said on Chinese social media platform Weibo.
The statement came in response to a Wall Street Journal report, which cited people familiar with the matter as saying Didi was considering delisting its share in the US as it faced increasing pressure from regulators in China.
Two days after Didi shares started trading on the New York Stock Exchange, China's internet regulator ordered online stores not to offer its app, saying it illegally collected users' personal data.
That sent the company's market value down sharply and it has now fallen by around a third since Didi raised $4.4bn (£3.15bn) in its initial public offering (IPO) a month ago.
On Thursday, a group of Republican senators called on the country's financial markets regulator to launch an inquiry into US-listed Chinese companies.
In the letter to the head of Securities and Exchanges Commission the seven lawmakers cited losses sustained by Didi investors after Beijing's took action against the company.
In recent months Chinese technology companies traded in the US, Hong Kong and mainland China have seen their share prices slump as Beijing tightens its grip on the industry.
Just this week authorities have cracked down on a range of online services from food delivery apps to music streaming platforms.
Didi shares ended Thursday's US trading day up by 11.3%."

DOH set the lowest and maximum ceiling prices for emergency medicines, such as analgesics, antibiotics, antibacterial medicines, respiratory tract medicines, and anti-asthma medicines. Price freeze was also set for medical supplies, such as the highly in demand N95 face mask. DOH said the N95 mask should cost between P45-P105, while disposable surgical masks should cost a maximum of P8 per piece.

“It is expected to come to the sea off Shanghai, China on around August 27th and move northward along the west coastal area of Korea before reaching the Chinese northeastern region on the evening of August 28th. The typhoon-15 will trigger strong wind and heavy rains in overall areas of Korea on August 27th and 28th,” the brief report added.

He appealed to Russia, Cyprus, Greece and Italy for help in putting out the fire, which began on the slopes of the Carmel hill, southeast of Israel’s port city of Haifa, and rapidly spread.
Cyprus and Greece agreed to dispatch firefighting helicopters.
Some nine hours after the blaze was estimated to have begun exhausted firefighters, those from Haifa reinforced by teams from all over Israel, and by soldiers, were still struggling to bring it under control, but without success.
“We’ve lost control of the fire,” a spokesman for Haifa’s firefighting services was quoted as saying.
Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovich said it was impossible to say when the fire could be brought under control. However, firefighters were speculated that as the fire spread west a major road linking Haifa with Tel Aviv to the south could act as a natural firebreak, or, failing that, the sea would.
At least 22 people were confirmed dead, but other accounts put the number as high as 40.
The fatalities were prison guards who had been drafted to help evacuate the 500 prisoners from a jail in the path of the flames. Their bus, with 50 people on board, was trapped by a falling tree and 40 of them burned to death. The others were injured.
The fire had been far from the road when the bus first set off, but spread about 1,500 metres in less than three minutes."

Two days after Hurricane Hanna touched down in South Texas, thousands remained without power and communities were grappling with how to deal with the damage caused by flooding and strong winds. The storm, which made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane Saturday evening at Padre Island, packed sustained winds as high as 90 mph before weakening into a tropical storm early Sunday and moving into northern Mexico. It was the first hurricane of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season. Hanna unleashed more than 15 inches of rain in parts of South Texas, resulting in serious flash flooding, according to The Washington Post. Gov. Greg Abbott warned Texans on Sunday that there are continued threats of flash flooding even as rainfall slows, due to overflowing rivers. ""Any additional rainfall will exacerbate these threats, but the State of Texas is ready to respond and protect our fellow Texans,"" he said in a statement. The Federal Emergency Management Agency and President Donald Trump approved a federal emergency declaration in response to Hanna, allowing for some federal assistance and reimbursement for evacuation efforts and shelter support. Abbott previously issued a disaster declaration for 32 counties. Downed power lines and trees have caused road closures across South Texas. As of 1 p.m. Monday, American Electric Power Texas, one of the state's largest electric providers, reported more than 58,000 power outages in Corpus Christi, Laredo and the Rio Grande Valley.

Three of those killed were children and 37 Turkish people were injured, including nine critically, Turkey's health ministry said. The shallow tremor caused more than 1,000 buildings to collapse in Turkey, prompting a brief rescue effort to find those trapped under rubble. The quake damaged buildings some 56 miles to the west in the Turkish city of Van, and to the east in dozens of villages in Iran, where state TV said 75 people were injured including six in hospital, though there were no fatalities. Turkish TV footage showed people digging with shovels and their hands in the rubble, as well as furniture and belongings strewn on cracked and snowy roads. In one village the ground cratered under several buildings, while in others residents were wrapped in blankets outside homes with crumbled and cracked exterior walls, fallen metal roofs and twisted wiring. ""The damage caused loss of life,"" the governor of Van, Mehmet Bilmez, told reporters standing in front of a pile of cinder blocks and sheet metal.

Danas, at one time a typhoon packing winds of 145 miles per hour, made a beeline toward the Japanese island of Okinawa. Okinawa is the home to Kadena Air Force base, which houses more than 18,000 American military personnel and their families. Luckily, Danas didn't make a direct hit on the island or the base and no immediate reports of damage were available.  
In an email to The Weather Channel the public affairs office on Kadena Air Force base says they used a graduated system of warnings, ranging from TC-4 to TC-1.  TC-4 is a general state of readiness where people have the basic essentials already stocked away. TC-1 is where 50 knot or greater winds are expected within 12 hours.  It also means that all facilities, except mission critical components, will be closed and people should fill available containers with drinking water.  While at TC-1 earlier in the day Tuesday, the bas has now been backed down to TC-4 and normal activities can resume.
As for staying informed about the latest, in the States, Kadena's public affairs office says this: ""Stateside friends and family like the Kadena Air Base Facebook page, and many people have already liked that page so they can keep up with what their family and friends are doing overseas.""
 Danas quickly weakened to a tropical storm after crossing the Japanese island of Tsushima, between South Korea and the Japanese mainland. And continued on a northeasterly course.

drought,"More than 44 per cent of India's areas were under various degrees of drought conditions (abnormally dry to exceptionally dry) as of June 10, 2019 — that is nearly 11 percentage point over a year ago, according to the Drought Early Warning System (DEWS).
Within this, ‘severe to exceptionally dry conditions’ prevailed in 17.33 per cent area, according to the real-time drought monitoring platform.
While just 0.65 per cent of area had ‘exceptionally dry’ conditions in June 2018, it has now jumped to 5.87 per cent, stated the latest data.
Further, the delay in southwest monsoons has worsened the drought index, the DEWS reported.
In the June 6 update, real-time platform recorded 43.02 per cent area under ‘abnormally to exceptionally dry’ conditions. However, the latest data showed an increase (44.17 per cent). 
Similarly, percentage of area under ‘extremely dry to exceptional dry’ increased from 10.83 to 11.22 per cent during the same period.
India has witnessed the second-driest pre-monsoon season in the last 65 years. The country received 99 millimeters (mm) rainfall between March and May — with 23 per cent below the normal rainfall during this time of the year —, showed the latest data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD).
The deficit is prevalent across the country with south India having a deficit of 47 per cent, followed by northwest India (30 per cent), central India (18 per cent), and east and northeast (14 per cent).
The month of June, which accounts for 18 per cent of rain, may end up with a deficit of 40 per cent in at least 66 districts across the country, warned Skymet Weather, a private weather forecasting agency.
The low rainfall would be difficult to make up for the deficit in coming months, it noted.
According to the IMD, there is also a possibility of weaker monsoon in July. It could be a great cause of worry, as the month is crucial and receives one third of the total monsoon rains in the country. 
The sluggish pace of the south west monsoon has compounded the severe dry spell. As a result, at least 30 sub-divisions are likely to experience ‘deficient’ and ‘largely deficient’ monsoon season, the IMD said.
Most of these are in Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, and the north eastern states. Only four sub-divisions in Karnataka, Gujarat, and Lakshadweep have witnessed ‘normal’ rainfall.
Low rainfall has also contributed to a downward trend in water levels in at least 71 of 91 reservoirs across India, a recent bulletin by the Central Water Commission (CWC), has showed.
The situation is particularly grim in the north-western region — in Gujarat and Maharashtra — and in the southern states of Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu, it said."

The Chilean air force's base is the country's largest in Antarctica and includes a village, hospital, school, bank, post office and chapel.
The maximum population in summer is 150 people, and the average population in winter is 80.
An unrelated 5.9-magnitude earthquake struck near Santiago on Saturday night, but Onemi said no significant damage or impact was reported.
Chile is one of the most seismically active countries in the world. An 8.8 magnitude temblor in Concepcion on February 27, 2010, left more than 500 dead.
The country suffered the most powerful earthquake ever recorded 60 years ago — measuring 9.6 magnitude — in Valdivia."
earthquake,"In a land of people used to earthquakes, everyone is saying this one, which hit at 14:46 local time, is the strongest they’ve ever felt-and that’s in Tokyo, some 400 kilometers southwest from the epicenter.
Scientists are calling it the biggest earthquake in Japan’s tremor-filled history. Preliminary estimates from the USGS put the magnitude at 7.9, which have since grown to 8.9. Estimates of the depth range from 10-20 kilometres. This earthquake was 178 times as powerful as the 1995 Hanshin/Kobe earthquake.
Miyagi prefecture was pummeled the hardest. There Japan’s earthquake intensity scale, which measures the amount of shaking at ground level, recorded a 7, the highest level. More than 20 deaths have been reported.
Tsunamis reaching 10 metres have hit the area and 3 metres tsunami are reported down all the way down the coast far past Tokyo.
Panic gripped Tokyo as bookshelves and installations in offices fell, people poured into the streets and more than a dozen buildings reported fire sending smoke billowing into the sky.
Trains are stopped as far down as Shizuoka, far south of Tokyo. Some phone lines are dead, but my internet is working. I’m writing minutes after the earthquake, stuck on a train that screeched to a halt and then bounced on the tracks"
wildfires,"A bushfire which threatened properties in the lower south-east of South Australia is now within containment lines.
It is in scrub and farmland at Marcollat, west of Padthaway, and was first reported about noon ACDT on Sunday.
The Country Fire Service (CFS) said thick scrub and sandy terrain posed challenges for fire crews.
The fire jumped the containment lines several times overnight, but is now within the breaks.
The greatest risk remains that the fire could spread north, but temperatures were lower on Monday and winds light, after Sunday saw temperatures in the low 40s and northerly winds of up to 40kph.
Residents at Lucindale, Naracoorte and Padthaway were being warned to keep doors and windows closed, because of smoke.
Regional fire commander Jason Druwitt said more local fire crews had been brought in on Monday morning, to help with mopping up efforts.
""The plan is to release all the crews from the fire ground at 1700,"" he said.
He said it was hoped all the firefighters could be home for Christmas and local landholders would keep watch until crews were again in the area on Boxing Day.
At the height of the blaze, there were four water bombers, 25 fire appliances and about 100 firefighters tackling the outbreak.
The CFS said an irrigation pump fire sparked the wider blaze, which blackened about 6,000 hectares."
Typhoon,"Tropical Storm Cristobal takes aims at Gulf Coast, Louisiana: Landfall expected Sunday MONROE, La. _ Tropical Storm Cristobal is expected to slowly strengthen Saturday night, moving toward a likely landfall on the Gulf Coast Sunday. Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency Saturday. Cristobal was upgraded from a tropical depression to a tropical storm over Mexico on Tuesday, becoming the third named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season. The National Hurricane Center said Cristobal's maximum sustained winds had strengthened to 50 mph Saturday evening. The storm was centered about 235 miles south of the mouth of the Mississippi River. Cristobal is not expected to become a hurricane, which typically have wind speeds of 75 mph. “The tropical storm-force winds extend outward at least 24 miles from the center,” meteorologist Dennis Feltgen said. “That's a big storm.” Landfall and tropical cyclones also trigger the possibility of tornadoes, Dennis cautioned. Heavy rainfall is expected this weekend and early next week in areas of the Mid-South and Gulf Coast from East Texas to Florida, the National Hurricane Center said. Flooding is predicted to reach as high as five feet above ground level along the mouth of the Mississippi River and Ocean Springs, up to four feet along the Morgan City shoreline and between one and three feet along the rest of the gulf. “We put our disaster teams and 70 mobile feeding units on standby,” Salvation Army Southern Territory Disaster Coordinator Jeff Jellets said. “We’re staying in close coordination with local officials, monitoring the storm path and, once the storm makes landfall, getting damage assessments.”"
earthquake,"Magnitude 4.9 earthquake strikes near Yerevan, Armenia An earthquake of magnitude 4.9 occurred only 7 minutes ago 11 km south of Yerevan, Armenia, the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) reported. The quake hit at a very shallow depth of 0 km beneath the epicenter near Yerevan, Armenia, early afternoon on Saturday 13 February 2021 at 3:29 pm local time. The exact magnitude, epicenter, and depth of the quake might be revised within the next few hours or minutes as seismologists review data and refine their calculations, or as other agencies issue their report. Our monitoring service identified a second report from the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) which listed the quake at magnitude 4.6. Based on the preliminary seismic data, the quake should have been widely felt by almost everyone in the area of the epicenter. It might have caused light to moderate damage. Moderate shaking probably occurred in Tokhanshalu (pop. 18,900) located 7 km from the epicenter. In Yerevan (pop. 1,093,500) located 11 km from the epicenter, Artashat (pop. 20,600) 14 km away, Vagharshapat (pop. 46,500) 20 km away, Ejmiatsin (pop. 49,500) 20 km away, Abovyan (pop. 35,700) 24 km away, Ashtarak (pop. 18,800) 27 km away, and Ararat (pop. 28,800) 33 km away, the quake should have been felt as light shaking. Weak shaking might have been felt in Gyumri (pop. 148,400) located 97 km from the epicenter. VolcanoDiscovery will automatically update magnitude and depth if these change and follow up if other significant news about the quake become available. If you’re in the area, please send us your experience through our reporting mechanism, either online or via our mobile app. This will help us provide more first-hand updates to anyone around the globe who wants to know more about this quake."
Typhoon,"The second powerful typhoon to slam Japan in a week unleashed fierce winds and rain on southern islands on Sunday, blowing off rooftops and leaving homes without power as it edged northward into an area vulnerable to flooding and mudslides
Weather officials warned that the rainfall from what could be a record storm would be fierce. Warnings were issued days in advance for people to be ready to take shelter and stock up on food and water.
Several rivers on the main southwestern island of Kyushu were at risk of overflowing, officials said. Public broadcaster NHK TV said evacuation warnings were issued for more than 50,000 people in Okinawa and Kyushu, including Kagoshima and and Nagasaki prefectures.
News footage showed people in Kyushu starting to gather at gymnasiums, before winds gather momentum in the evening. Social distancing will be in place to guard against the coronavirus pandemic, officials said.
The Japan Meteorological Agency said Typhoon Haishen, which means “sea god” in Chinese, was packing sustained winds of up to 162 kilometers (100 miles) per hour after battering Okinawa and the southern Kyushu island of Amami Oshima early Sunday. Alerts for strong winds, waves, high tides, rainfall and lightning were issued for Amami Oshima alongside evacuation orders.
There were no immediate reports of any injuries in Okinawa, home to more than half of the roughly 50,000 U.S. troops based in Japan under a bilateral treaty.
Haishen was not only powerful — equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane — but also large in its reach, according to the meteorological agency.
Bullet trains were temporarily halting services, and dozens of flights were canceled. All Nippon Airways said such cancellations will continue Monday and possibly on Tuesday for flights in southern Japan, such as Yamaguchi, Kochi and Fukuoka.
Haishen’s projected course has it hitting the Korean Peninsula later in the week.
Haishen’s course is similar to Typhoon Maysak, which lashed southern Japan last week, injuring dozens of people and cutting power to thousands of homes.
A cargo ship carrying 43 crew members and 5,800 cows from New Zealand capsized off the coast of Japan. Two people were rescued, and one body was recovered. The search has been halted because of Haishen."
wildfires,"Strong winds and low humidities from Tropical Storm Lee without the benefit of any rain have created conditions ripe for wildfires in Texas. The Texas Forest Service is reporting that approximately 429 homes have been destroyed in the 38 large fires that are currently burning.
On Sunday Texas mobilized additional National Guard Blackhawk helicopters and Texas Intrastate Fire Mutual Aid System (TIFMAS) strike teams as well as a heavy airtanker from South Dakota. At this time dozens of firefighting aircraft are being used, including four heavy airtankers, 15 single-engine airtankers, 12 helicopters, and 13 aerial supervision aircraft. A Type 1 incident management team has been requested to assist with the Bastrop County Complex.
The strong winds are expected to continue over the east half or more of the state along with drier relative humidities into the 10 to 20 percent range across much of the state. High temperatures will be in the upper 70s to lower 80s over a large portion of North Texas to near 100 over Deep South Texas near the Mexico border. The stronger winds are expected to weaken over most of the state Monday night."
earthquake,"Turkey earthquake: Scores rescued from collapsed buildings, many still trapped More than 40 people have been pulled to safety after spending hours trapped under collapsed buildings following Friday's earthquake. Hopes are fading for dozens of others still imprisoned under concrete ruins. Emergency services in the eastern Turkish city of Elazig continued efforts on Sunday to rescue residents from collapsed buildings after a 6.8 magnitude earthquake shook the region and left at least 38 people dead. A total of 45 people had been pulled alive from under the rubble, officials said. But hopes of finding more survivors are fading as rescue teams struggle to comb through debris in freezing temperatures. Many people in Elazig province and nearby Malatya spent several hours, and some of them days, under piles of rubble before rescue crews were able to reach them. A 35-year-old woman named Ayse Yildiz was trapped for 28 hours under her apartment building in Elazig with her 2-year-old daughter, Yusra. According to Turkish media, rescue workers pulled the young girl from the wreckage at around 8:30 p.m. local time (1730 UTC) on Saturday, but it took nearly five more hours to rescue Yildiz, whose arm was trapped under a pile of rubble."

wildfires,"More than 70 homes have been lost in a wildfire outside Australia's western city of Perth which is expected to continue burning for days.
The fire had razed more than 9,000 hectares of farm and woodland in hills east of Perth by early Wednesday, authorities said.
Western Australia state's Fire and Emergency Services Commissioner Darren Klemm said the number of houses destroyed had jumped to 71 from 59 overnight, and conditions would remain difficult for firefighters with no rain forecast until Sunday.  
""We're into Day 3 of this fire today and it's going to continue to be a challenging fire for us for at least the next three or four or five days,"" Klemm said.
Six firefighters sustained minor injuries, Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported. No other injuries were reported."
Typhoon,"CloudSat overpassed Typhoon Utor in the West Pacific on August 11, 2013 at 0518 UTC, this storm contained estimated maximum strength winds of 115 knots (132 mph) and minimum pressure of 937mb.
The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA's Aqua satellite captured the infrared (IR) image taken a few minutes before the CloudSat overpass (the blue line A-> B on Figures 1, 2 and 3). CloudSat overpassed about 10km to the east of the center of the storm revealing the structure of the eye and eye wall. This is one a handful of cases where CloudSat has directly intersected the eye of a storm of this intensity and size. The strength of Utor's at this time is equivalent to category 4 strength hurricane.
This overpass reveals many unique features of a well defined and intense Typhoon (tropical cyclone) - outward sloping eye and eyewall, rainband areas, moats and areas of high reflectivity (greater than 30dBZ). Heavy precipitation is distinuguished by the attenuation of the radar (lack of signal) in the lowest 5 km's (up to almost 10 km's in the eyewall area) of the CloudSat swath. The CloudSat overpasses reveals large amounts of liquid and ice water spread throughout the storm and also distinguishes rainbands areas separated by moats (cloud free areas) beneath the cirrus canopy."
drought,"The mighty Rio Grande is looking less mighty as U.S. forecasters predict spring flows will be less than half of average — or worse — and that signals potential trouble for the already stressed waterway.
One of the longest rivers in North America, the Rio Grande delivers drinking water and irrigation supplies to millions of people from southern Colorado into Texas and Mexico under a decades-old water-sharing agreement. With more dry years than wet ones over the last two decades, how much water ends up flowing downstream has been a point of contention among the states.
As New Mexico and Texas battle over their shares before the U.S. Supreme Court, forecasters with the federal government’s Natural Resources Conservation Service say river and stream flows across New Mexico have dropped noticeably following a somewhat dry March.
The models show drought is expected to keep its hold over the mountains along the New Mexico-Colorado border that feed the Rio Grande, while California, Nevada and other southwestern states aren’t likely to see a reprieve from dry conditions through June."
earthquake,"7.5M Earthquake Jolts Alaska: Scientists Warn Imminent 'Mega-Tsunami' Here Within a Year Due to Melting Ice The Alaska Peninsula was hit by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Monday afternoon, October 19, triggering a tsunami warning in the region. But the threat is not over. Scientists said the melting glaciers in Alaska region could unleash a 'mega-tsunami,' with a destructive high wall of water. As per the scientists, the glacier retreat in Prince William Sound—a narrow sea channel on the south coast of the U.S. state of Alaska—is now destabilizing mountain slopes and a massive tsunami could appear as early as 2021. A group of experts in an open letter to Alaskan authorities said that collapsing mountain slopes in Alaska caused 633 feet high waves in 2015. The researchers also noted that in west Greenland, a landslide in June 2017 produced a tsunami that killed four people and destroyed a large portion of the town of Nuugaatsiaq. According to the findings, the tsunami could impact areas frequently visited by tourists, fishing vessels, and hunters. The team of scientists believes that there is a possibility that this landslide-led tsunami ""will happen within the next year, and likely within 20 years."""
Typhoon,"Earth’s strongest storm of 2013 so far, typhoon Utor, did a number on the northern Philippines.  Now it’s destined for southeastern China.
Utor, referred to as Labuyo in the Philippines, packed maximum sustained winds of 140 mph as it battered the northern island of Luzon.
The storm killed at least two people and destroyed 80 percent of the infrastructure in town of Casiguran near where it came inland according to reports.
In the hours prior to landfall, Utor’s intensity peaked at 150 mph, the equivalent of high-end category 4 hurricane and earning it “super typhoon” status (winds must be 150 mph for “super typhoon” classification), briefly.  That intensity bested any storm globally in 2013 writes Jeff Masters at wunderground.
“Earth’s previous most powerful tropical cyclone of 2013 was Typhoon Soulik, which reached Category 4 strength with 145 mph winds on July 10,” Masters says.
As it passed over Luzon, Utor dumped over 7.5 inches of rain in the cities of Dagupan and and Baguio notes AccuWeather.
The storm weakened markedly as it crossed over Luzon’s mountainous terrain, but is likely to regain some strength as it passes over the South China Sea.  As of 11 a.m., the Joint Typhoon Warning Center says its maximum sustained winds are around 100 mph and it forecasts gradual strengthening over the next two days:"

The USGS reports a magnitude 6.9 earthquake hit 2:33 a.m. Thursday local time, in an area northeast of Japan. While shaking was reported in the Japanese island of Hokkaido, there were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. The Japan Meterological Agency reported no tsunami threat to Japan, while the U.S. Tsunami Warning System said there was no tsunami threat to Guam and Saipan. There are 56 islands in the Kuril Islands, with many of them being rock formations. These islands are part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, an arc of fault lines, that leave this region vulnerable to sizeable earthquakes."
