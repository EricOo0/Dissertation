drought,"Florida's lack of rain the past few months, even by dry season standards, left airboats stuck in the wetlands of the Everglades. 
A Broward County Fire Rescue airboat had to be freed Wednesday after getting stuck in low water in the Everglades after helping to free a civilian airboat.
Over the past two months, drought conditions have developed and worsened over a sizable swath of the Florida Peninsula.
As of April 18, about half the state (46 percent) –  an area including an estimated 10.2 million residents – was classified in drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor analysis. This is the largest swath of the Sunshine state in drought since April 2, 2013.
The worst of the drought was a swath of central and southwest Florida, including Tampa/St. Petersburg, Fort Myers, Naples, Melbourne, and parts of the Orlando metro area.
Orlando International Airport had yet to receive any measurable rainfall this month through April 19, only the second time that has happened dating to 1953.
The paltry 0.10 inch of rain since March 1 was the driest spring-to-date rain total in 122 years of metro area records. Average rainfall from March 1-April 19 is 5.59 inches.
Fort Myers (0.35 inch; fourth driest) and Naples (0.89 inch; 10th driest) have also had a notably dry spring.
Given the prolonged lack of rain, Florida's peak of the wildfire season, typically during the spring months, has been quite active."
earthquake,"A powerful earthquake of 6.4 magnitude killed at least six people as it tore down buildings in central Croatia today, as rescuers combed toppled roofs and rubble in the dark.
The tremors were felt as far afield as Vienna while the damage was concentrated in and around Petrinja, a town some 50 kilometres south of Croatia's capital Zagreb. 
Rescuers tried to pull people from the rubble of collapsed buildings, television footage showed, and army troops were sent in to the area to help.
As rescue teams shovelled away bricks and other debris, some elderly residents gathered in a park in downtown Petrinja, wrapped in blankets and afraid to return home. 
""All the tiles in the bathroom are broken, all the dishes fell out"", Marica Pavlovic, a 72-year-old retired meat factory worker, told AFP of the damage to her home.  
""Even if we wanted to, we can't go back in, there is no electricity."" 
The GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences said the quake hit at a depth of 10km. The epicentre was in the town of Petrinja, 50km south of the Croatian capital Zagreb.
Tomislav Fabijanic, head of emergency medical services in nearby Sisak, said many people had been injured in Petrinja and in Sisak.
""There are fractures, there are concussions and some had to be operated on,"" he said.
Prime Minister Adrej Plenkovic, who rushed to Petrinja, said: ""The army is here to help. We will have to move some people from Petrinja because it is unsafe to be here."""
other,"Since the fifth bi-monthly statement of December 2015, global growth has slowed, with the ongoing weakening of activity in major emerging market economies (EMEs) outweighing the recovery in some advanced economies (AEs). World trade has remained subdued, held down by anaemic demand, new lows in commodity prices and currency realignments. In the United States, an improving labour market continues to support a consumption-led recovery. Manufacturing activity is sluggish, however, reflecting retrenchment in oil and gas drilling activity and declining exports. In the Euro area, improving labour market and financing conditions are supporting consumer spending and business investment. Although core inflation and wage growth are subdued, deflation risks appear to be receding. In Japan, the combination of exceptional monetary accommodation and fiscal stimulus has failed to spur sustainable domestic demand so far. In China, growth in Q4 of 2015 was the slowest since 2009, pulled down by manufacturing, residential investment and exports. EME commodity exporters confront recessionary conditions, falling currencies, sluggish exports and still high inflation relative to their recent histories.The December calm in global financial markets _ suggesting that the normalisation of US monetary policy was fully anticipated _ was dispelled in January 2016 by fears of further weakening of the Chinese economy and the depreciation of the Renminbi. Capital outflows from China triggered sell-offs across AEs and EMEs, exacerbating currency declines and heightening volatility. Crude oil prices fell below US $ 30 per barrel _ a 12-year low _on expectations of Iran adding to the supply glut. Prices of gold prices and US Treasuries hardened on safe haven demand. Financial markets remain vulnerable to bouts of volatility and capital outflows from EMEs as an asset class. Bearish commodity price dynamics are also likely to impact investor sentiment."
other,"The Fed uses three main instruments in regulating the money supply: open-market operations, the discount rate, and reserve requirements. The first is by far the most important. By buying or selling government securities (usually bonds), the Fed¡ªor a central bank¡ªaffects the money supply and interest rates. If, for example, the Fed buys government securities, it pays with a check drawn on itself. This action creates money in the form of additional deposits from the sale of the securities by commercial banks. By adding to the cash reserves of the commercial banks, then, the Fed enables those banks to increase their lending capacity. Consequently, the additional demand for government bonds bids up their price and thus reduces their yield (i.e., interest rates). The purpose of this operation is to ease the availability of credit and to reduce interest rates, which thereby encourages businesses to invest more and consumers to spend more. The selling of government securities by the Fed achieves the opposite effect of contracting the money supply and increasing interest rates."
other,"The Australian economy is continuing to benefit from favourable international conditions. The global expansion is proceeding at a strong pace and is broadly based across the world's main economic regions. Growth in the United States economy is now showing further strength after a temporary dip late last year. In Japan the indications are that the recovery is gathering momentum, and there are encouraging signs that the economy has emerged from the debt-deflation spiral of the past decade or more. In China and other parts of Asia the already rapid pace of growth appears to have picked up further recently. Overall, the world economy is likely to expand at a faster-than-average pace in 2006 for the fourth successive year, and most observers expect this to continue in 2007.The strong global expansion in recent years has been accompanied by sustained upward pressure on a range of international commodity prices. An important aspect of this has been the rise in world oil prices. Concerns about possible supply disruptions have at times contributed to these oil price fluctuations, but for the most part the upward trend has been a consequence of strong global demand. As a result, expectations of world growth have generally remained strong throughout the period when oil prices have been rising."
earthquake,"A magnitude 7.4 earthquake hit southern Mexico on Tuesday, affecting the coast of Oaxaca state and setting off a tsunami in nearby Pacific coastal areas. At least six people have been killed so far. A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck Mexico’s southern state of Oaxaca on Tuesday at 10:29 a.m, according to Mexico's Seismic Institute"
Typhoon,"Typhoon Bolaven is forecast to be moving towards the Korean Peninsula and is likely to move west of Seoul.
At least four people were injured, but reported wind speeds on Okinawa and nearby Amami were lower than forecast.
About 57,000 people on the islands were left without power, Japanese media reported.
Residents had been told to stay at home and protect themselves against the strong winds and heavy rain.
Forecasters had predicted slow-moving Typhoon Bolaven could be the strongest storm to hit the area in over 50 years.
Public broadcaster NHK said gusts could overturn cars, while waves around the island could reach 12m (40ft).
Japan's meteorological agency estimated wind speeds near the storm's centre at around 180km/h (112 mph), with extremely strong gusts reaching 252 km/h.
But NHK reported early Monday morning that the strongest gusts measured on the islands - on Amami, north of Okinawa - reached just 140km/h, according to the AP news agency."
flood,"Floods in Nepal, Bhutan leave dozens dead, scores missing At least 10 people were feared dead in Nepal and another 10 in Bhutan with scores still missing as devastating floods and landslides hit the Himalayan nations.  Torrential monsoon rain and flash floods, thought to have been triggered by a glacial outburst in a high-lying region bordering Tibet on June 16, inundated Sindhupalchok district of Nepal, about 70 kilometers from capital Kathmandu, sweeping away settlements, bridges and other infrastructure.  Among the dead were one Indian and two Chinese workers, local media reported. Many people were swept away by fast-flowing floodwater, prompting frantic rescue attempts by Nepal’s army and police in affected areas. About 70 people have been rescued while many remain unaccounted for.  Following warnings about landslides blocking the Indravati River, thousands of people in Melamchi Bazar rushed to safer places with whatever they could grab.  Among the worst-hit settlements were Melamchi Municipality, Helambu Rural Municipality, Pachpokhari Thangpal Rural Municipality and Indrawati Rural Municipality on the banks of the Indravati River."
drought,"Between 2015 and 2017 South Africa’s South Western Cape region experienced three of its lowest rainfall years on record. This led to the progressive depletion of water supply reservoirs and by the summer of 2017/18 there was a real danger that – without drastic reductions in water use – the region, and especially the city of Cape Town, would run out of water.
Droughts close to this magnitude have occurred in the past (for example in the late 1920s, early 1970s, and 2003 to 2004) and led to water shortages in Cape Town. But are they getting worse?
The reliable yield of the South Western Cape water system has, until now, been calculated under the assumption of a stationary climate. This is the idea that past rainfall can be used to estimate present day as well as future rainfall, and then also water system yields. A water resource model is used to estimate the frequency of failure under all the known past rainfall conditions – in the case of this region, the last 80 or so years. The water system is then designed to be fairly reliable. The supply system for Cape Town and surround areas was designed to maintain supply without imposing water restrictions 98% of the time, or – on average – 49 out of every 50 years.
It’s known that the climate is going to change in the future, as a succession of international scientific assessments have shown. And many water resource planners are taking climate change into account when upgrading existing or designing new water supply systems.
But has this changing global climate already altered the risk of droughts like the one Cape Town just experienced?
We assessed this in a recently published analysis. Using a range of modelling approaches, we first estimated the frequency and intensity of three-year rainfall amounts over the South Western Cape in a world without human-induced warming of the climate.
We then compared this to drought risk in the world we actually live in, where greenhouse gases and other pollutants have warmed the planet by about one degree."
other,"Hong Kong's national security police are investigating the group behind the city's annual June 4 vigil, which commemorates pro-democracy protesters who died in the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown in Beijing, according to a letter to organizers seen by CNN.
The Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China must submit personal details of all its directors and members, including their names, dates of birth, addresses, contact information and roles, the police letter said. It also demanded the group -- formed more than three decades ago to support those protesting for democracy in Beijing -- provide all meeting records with political groups in Hong Kong, Taiwan and overseas, as well as its source of income.
The police letter said the request was made because it was ""reasonable to believe"" it would help investigate possible crimes against national security. The alliance must provide the information within 14 days, or they could be prosecuted, it added.
Hong Kong police confirmed to CNN in a statement that they had requested ""certain persons"" provide information that is ""related to the maintenance of national security,"" but declined to provide more details.
The letter came after public broadcaster RTHK reported this week that the alliance has considered disbanding following Beijing's promulgation last year of a sweeping national security law that criminalizes secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces.
In the wake of the legislation, the city's political and social landscape has been transformed. Under the security law, protesters, journalists and pro-democracy figures have been arrested; newsrooms have been raided and forced to shut down; textbooks, films and websites face new censorship; and civic organizations including labor unions have folded after pressure from authorities."
wildfires,"In Big Basin State Park south of San Francisco — may be a holdover from the fire 9 months ago
On Monday firefighters suppressed a fire that burned within the perimeter of the CZU Lightning Complex of fires. The blaze was in Big Basin Redwoods State Park south of San Francisco and could be a holdover from the 86,502-acre blaze from August, 2020.
When firefighters hiked into the fire it was less than two acres, but with the assistance of aircraft they stopped the spread after it burned about seven acres.
In January several other holdover fires were found in the footprint of the same fire.
There is a chance that considering the numerous very large fires that spread through California and Oregon last year, and with lower than normal precipitation during the winter, other similar holdover fires will be discovered. In many cases since they are within the burn perimeter, they may not be a serious problem. But if they are in a large unburned island, burning embers lofted into the air could ignite spot fires some distance away, perhaps outside the perimeter where there is an abundance of available fuel."
drought,"Southern Africa is experiencing one of the worst droughts in years, with more than 40 million people expected to face food insecurity because of livestock and crop losses. Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Zimbabwe have declared it an emergency.
In semi-arid Botswana, the farmers are reeling after the worst drought in a decade wiped out entire harvests and left the land littered with dead livestock.
Two thirds of the crops planted last season failed, while Ngamiland, a rich beef producing region, has recorded nearly 40,000 cattle deaths.
Rancher Casper Matsheka says there was no food or water, so his animals starved to death.
“The goats died, as well as the cattle, as you can see the carcasses all over. We were really affected. If only the government could subsidize the prices of feed and vaccines for the livestock during such times,” he said.
Nor has the drought sparred wildlife.
National parks authorities have resorted to feeding starving hippos while hundreds of elephants have died.
Environmental nongovernment organization, Kalahari Conservation Society’s Neil Fitt says competition for food and water has increased the risk of human-wildlife conflict.
“The livestock are now putting pressure on the wildlife areas, so the wildlife are also getting pressure on their areas, and that is where the conflict zone is,” he said. “Why I am bringing this up? The... interconnected with the drought is this wildlife-human conflict.”
In Botswana, where drought is frequent, President Mokgweetsi Masisi said the government plans to stop calling it an emergency and instead make drought relief part of the national budget.
“Government has taken a decision to develop a Drought Management Strategy, which would classify drought as a permanent feature in our budget plans, rather than an emergency,” he said. “The strategy will be completed before the end of the financial year.”
Acting director of Meteorological Services Radithupa Radithupa says a robust strategy is needed to deal with the recurring droughts.
“We are looking at climate change as an impact now, we are seeing the impact now in terms of heating, the dry spells and the excessive rains. Therefore, we really need to adapt as a nation,” Radithupa said.
Meanwhile, a forecast for rain has raised hopes among farmers and ranchers for recovery and that this season of severe drought won’t be a total loss."
Typhoon,"2020 hurricane season continues to break records with formation of Tropical Storm Edouard; 2 other systems being monitored After a brief respite, the tropics became more active over the Fourth of July weekend, with three systems currently being monitored by the National Hurricane Center, including Tropical Storm Edouard. Of the three, one in the northern Gulf of Mexico is expected to bring heavy rain and isolated flooding to the Florida Panhandle and North Florida today as it moves across the state. Tropical Storm Edouard expected to weaken later today Tropical Storm Edouard formed Sunday night well off the eastern U.S. Location: 435 miles south of Cape Race, Newfoundland Maximum sustained winds: 45 mph Movement: northeast at 37 mph"
other,"Economic developments continue to be driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and the responses to it. The initial outbreaks prompted significant restrictions on activity and resulted in very large contractions in output. Most economies have been recovering from these initial contractions. But in most cases, economies still remain well below pre-pandemic levels, and in Europe fresh outbreaks are threatening even this progress.In Australia, economic activity contracted substantially in the early months of the pandemic and has since recovered some of that decline. The 7 per cent contraction in GDP in the June quarter was the largest peacetime contraction since at least the 1930s, and certainly one of the most sudden. It was nonetheless not as big a fall as had been feared, and was less than that experienced in many other countries. The less negative outcome stemmed largely from Australia's early success in bringing new infection rates down, which allowed restrictions on activity to be eased sooner than earlier thought."
drought,"Due to this summer’s drought in Central Europe, boulders known as “hunger stones” are reappearing in the Elbe River.
The low water levels in the river that begins in the Czech Republic then crosses Germany into the North Sea has exposed stones on the river bed whose appearances in history used to warn people that hard times were coming.
Over a dozen of the hunger stones, chosen to record low water levels, can now be seen in and near the northern Czech town of Decin near the German border.
The oldest water mark visible dates to 1616. That stone, is considered the oldest hydrological landmark in Central Europe, bears a chiseled inscription in German that says: “When you see me, cry.”"
drought,"More than half of India is reeling from drought-like conditions, the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) latest data shows, with millions struggling for drinking water as lakes dry up and groundwater levels deplete amid a sluggish monsoon that, as per the agriculture ministry, has impacted the sowing of key summer crops over the past two weeks.
According to IMD, the monsoon was 39% deficient till June 22 despite marginal improvement over the last week. In its Sunday bulletin, the national weather forecaster said the monsoon advanced into parts of central Maharashtra, Marathwada and Vidarbha, remaining areas of Karnataka, Telangana, Odisha, Jharkhand, Gangetic West Bengal and Bihar, most parts of Chhattisgarh, and some areas of eastern Uttar Pradesh. But the weather system’s poor intensity has stoked a severe water crisis in many states, as half the country, especially states such as Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telengana and Andhra Pradesh, battle a drought-like situation..
Most districts in east, central and peninsular India are facing “extremely dry” conditions, as per the Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) that shows the observed rainfall amount compared with the rainfall climatology at a certain place over a long-term reference period. The index is released by IMD Pune’s Climate Application and User Interface team."
earthquake,"A 6.2-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Indonesia's Sumatra Island Wednesday, the US Geological Survey said, but there was no tsunami warning or immediate reports of damage.
The strong offshore quake hit about 217 kilometres south-southwest of the city of Bengkulu at a shallow depth of 10 kilometres at 7:52 pm local time (1252 GMT).
Shallow quakes tend to cause more damage than deep ones.
The Southeast Asian archipelago experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity due to its position on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", where tectonic plates collide.
More than 100 people were killed when a 6.2-magnitude quake rocked the small city of Mamuju on Sulawesi island last month.
In 2018, a 7.5-magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami on Sulawesi island left more than 4,300 people dead or missing.
A devastating 9.1-magnitude quake struck off the coast of Sumatra in 2004, triggering a tsunami that killed 220,000 throughout the region, including around 170,000 in Indonesia -- one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history."
other,"In the fourth bi-monthly resolution of October 2018, CPI inflation was projected at 4.0 per cent in Q2:2018-19, 3.9-4.5 per cent in H2 and 4.8 per cent in Q1:2019-20, with risks somewhat to the upside. Excluding the HRA impact, CPI inflation was projected at 3.7 per cent in Q2:2018-19, 3.8-4.5 per cent in H2 and 4.8 per cent in Q1:2019-20. The actual inflation outcome in Q2 at 3.9 per cent was marginally lower than the projection of 4.0 per cent. However, the October inflation print at 3.3 per cent turned out to be unexpectedly low.There have been several important developments since the October policy which will have a bearing on the inflation outlook. First, despite a significant scaling down of inflation projections in the October policy primarily due to moderation in food inflation, subsequent readings have continued to surprise on the downside with the food group slipping into deflation. At a disaggregated level, deflation in pulses, vegetables and sugar widened, while cereals inflation moderated sequentially. The broad-based weakening of food prices imparts downward bias to the headline inflation trajectory, going forward. Secondly, in contrast to the food group, there has been a broad-based increase in inflation in non-food groups. Thirdly, international crude oil prices have declined sharply since the last policy; the price of Indian crude basket collapsed to below US$ 60 a barrel by end-November after touching US$ 85 a barrel in early October. However, selling prices, as reported by firms polled in the Reserve Bank¡¯s latest IOS, are expected to edge up further in Q4 on the back of increased demand. Fourthly, global financial markets have continued to be volatile with EME currencies showing a somewhat appreciating bias in the last one month. Finally, the effect of the 7th Central Pay Commission¡¯s HRA increase has continued to wane along expected lines. Taking all these factors into consideration and assuming a normal monsoon in 2019, inflation is projected at 2.7-3.2 per cent in H2:2018-19 and 3.8-4.2 per cent in H1:2019-20, with risks tilted to the upside (Chart 1). The projected inflation path remains unchanged after adjusting for the HRA impact of central government employees as this impact dissipates completely from December 2018 onwards. Although recent food inflation prints have surprised on the downside and prices of petroleum products have softened considerably, it is important to monitor their evolution closely and allow heightened short-term uncertainties to be resolved by incoming data.Turning to growth projections, although Q2 growth was lower than that projected in the October policy, GDP growth in H1 has been broadly along the line in the April policy when for the year as a whole GDP growth was projected at 7.4 per cent. Going forward, lower rabi sowing may adversely affect agriculture and hence rural demand. Financial market volatility, slowing global demand and rising trade tensions pose negative risk to exports. However, on the positive side, the decline in crude oil prices is expected to boost India¡¯s growth prospects by improving corporate earnings and raising private consumption through higher disposable incomes. Increased capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector also portends well for new capacity additions. There has been significant acceleration in investment activity and high frequency indicators suggest that it is likely to be sustained. Credit offtake from the banking sector has continued to strengthen even as global financial conditions have tightened. FDI flows could also increase with the improving prospects of the external sector. The demand outlook as reported by firms polled in the Reserve Bank¡¯s IOS has improved in Q4. Based on an overall assessment, GDP growth for 2018-19 has been projected at 7.4 per cent (7.2-7.3 per cent in H2) as in the October policy, and for H1:2019-20 at 7.5 per cent, with risks somewhat to the downside (Chart 2)."
wildfires,"Three factors influence the impact of wildfire risk on property losses: fuel, slope, and access. The primary risk factor is a property’s proximity to vegetation—grass, trees, and scrub or brush—which provides fuel for a fire. Another important factor is topography, or slope, which influences the speed of wildfire spread. Finally, access—or specifically lack of access—is a critical factor. We’ve learned through experience that when properties are on dead-end streets or in single-access neighborhoods, firefighters face added challenges.
In addition to examining those risk factors, our analysis also considered time-dependent, weather-related factors. California experienced extreme drought conditions this past summer, with hardly any rainfall, and we found that to be significant. We also looked at wind patterns.
Even before the Valley and Butte fires erupted, our assessment had placed a large number of properties destroyed or damaged in their wake at high risk based on location and vegetation risk factors. Our modeling also established the Valley and Butte locations as areas with high loss potential before the fires, as illustrated by the map to the right.
As illustrated on the maps below, in both fires we found a significant correlation between burn severity and the proximity of vegetative fuel. As we see more frequently, people are building homes and other structures in the California foothills, former wildlands dominated by vegetation. In such an environment, or wildland-urban interface (or intermix, depending upon proximity to wildland fuels), properties are at a higher risk for loss.
A good number of properties destroyed or damaged in the Valley and Butte fires were located on steep slopes—and steeper slopes can increase the speed and intensity of wildfire. Winds also played a role. We detected anomalous wind patterns, with wind gusts in the area of 30 miles per hour, in both the Valley and Butte fires. Those winds had a role in spreading the fires and making it difficult for firefighters to control the flames. The Valley and Butte wind patterns, however, didn’t approach the magnitude of the infamous 60-mile-per-hour Santa Ana winds, responsible for fanning California’s most devastating wildfires."
flood,"Heavy rains in Texas, Louisiana add to misery in flood zones BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — The National Weather Service warned Wednesday that more rain is expected this week in Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas, including areas where flooding has already caused misery this week.  Forecasters said 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters) of rain could fall in southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana on Thursday and Friday, two areas already hard hit. Flash flood watches stretched from southwest Louisiana and east Texas northward into Arkansas and Oklahoma Wednesday evening. The weather service said they would be in effect through Thursday evening there and along the western and central Gulf of Mexico coast."
other,"MAS will maintain its current monetary policy stance, and continue to allow a gradual, modest appreciation of the Singapore dollar on a trade-weighted basis. In our view, this policy will help to cap incipient inflationary pressures while remaining supportive of economic activity, as the economy comes off its cyclical high and GDP growth moderates to a more sustainable rate.External developments, especially the possibility of a US hard landing, will have a major impact on prospects for the Singapore economy. These cannot be reliably predicted now, as the US economy is at a turning point. MAS will monitor closely these external developments, as well as our domestic economy. We will review the policy stance in the middle of the year, or sooner if necessary."
other,"GDP growth in the Singapore economy has eased, bringing the level of output closer to its underlying potential. Despite some pickup in labour costs, inflationary pressures are mild and should remain contained.  MAS will therefore maintain the current rate of appreciation of the S$NEER policy band. There will be no change to its width and the level at which it is centred. This policy stance is consistent with a modest and gradual appreciation path of the S$NEER policy band that will ensure medium-term price stability. "
other,"In the implementation of monetary policy, Bank Indonesia applies an Inflation Targeting Framework (ITF). ITF is a framework of publicly announcing an inflation target corridor and adjusting monetary policy to achieve that target as part of the commitment and accountability of the central bank. In practice, ITF is implemented using a policy rate as a signal of monetary policy and the interbank rate as the operational target. The Inflation Targeting Framework was formally adopted by Bank Indonesia on 1st July 2005, replacing base money as the target of monetary policy.Based on experience from the Global Financial Crisis in 2008/2009, an important lesson that emerged was the need for adequate central bank flexibility in response to more complex economic developments and a stronger financial sector influence on macroeconomic stability. Consequently, Bank Indonesia strengthened the ITF framework through its evolution into Flexible ITF.__"
wildfires,"FIREFIGHTERS have worked through the night to try to control a series of forest fires in the south of France, near Montpellier and Marseille.
The biggest, around Montaud and Saint-Bauzille-de-Montmel in the Hérault countryside north of Montpellier, destroyed more than 2,600 hectares of woodland and a dozen homes.
There have been no reported casualties.
Almost 1,000 firefighters remained on the scene last night to try to contain the fire and keep it away from the city and main roads.
Reinforcements were brought in from the Bouches-du-Rh?ne, Auvergne and Alpes-Maritimes.
Helicopters and Canadair firefighting planes were due to resume their work at dawn to contain the blaze and assess the damage. The fire was said to be under control shortly before midday.
Two smaller fires were reported nearby yesterday. One, between Mèze and Villeveyrac, destroyed 600 hectares of land, including four homes, a restaurant, a warehouse and a dozen vehicles.
The other was between Juvignac and Grabbels, north-west of Montpellier. Residents were evacuated as a precaution but the fire was quickly contained.
Travel delays in Bouches-du-Rh?ne
In the Bouches-du-Rh?ne, there are severe delays on the main rail line between Marseille and Toulon because of the forest fire yesterday near Cassis and La Ciotat.
Firefighters say the blaze is now under control. It spread through 250 hectares of land, fanned by a 50mph Mistral wind.
About a hundred people were evacuated from nearby homes and spent the night in a school gym. They should be allowed to go back to their homes later this morning.
Train services on the south coast mainline were suspended yesterday and are running today at a reduced speed. Some Toulon TGVs are starting from Marseille instead.
The A50 motorway remains closed this morning at Carnoux-en-Provence.
Police investigations are under way to determine the cause of the fires."
other,"A sustained rise in CPI inflation excluding food and fuel started in H2:2017-18 and continued into H1:2018-19 _ it rose from 5.1 per cent in February to 6.4 per cent in June, before moderating to 6.2 per cent in July and further to 6.0 per cent in August (Chart II.13). Adjusted for the estimated HRA impact, CPI inflation excluding food and fuel was 5.5 per cent in H1:2018-19 (up to August) _ 70 bps lower than the actual outcome. Housing inflation contributed close to 30 per cent of the increase in CPI inflation excluding food and fuel in H1:2018-19 (up to August), largely reflecting the HRA increases of central government employees (Chart II.14). Adjusted for HRA, the housing group still contributed a fifth of overall increase in CPI inflation excluding food and fuel. The second largest contributor in this category was the transport and communication sub-group, largely reflecting increases in petrol and diesel pump prices and second-round effects on transport fares. Petrol (and diesel) pump prices during H1:2018-19 increased sharply by about _10 per litre, as international prices surged (Chart II.15). As a result, the contribution of petrol and diesel (with a weight of 2.3 per cent) to CPI excluding food and fuel inflation rose from 1.7 per cent in March 2018 to 8.6 per cent in August. Accentuating the impact of petrol and diesel on inflation in the recent period has been the asymmetric pass-through of international crude oil prices to domestic prices since 2014 (Chart II.15).Excluding food, fuel, petrol and diesel, CPI inflation increased from 5.2 per cent in February to peak at 6.2 per cent in June, before moderating to 5.8 per cent in July and to 5.7 per cent in August. Excluding the four volatile items _ petrol, diesel, gold and silver _ as well as housing, CPI inflation increased by 120 bps from February to 5.5 per cent in June, before moderating to 5.0_5.1 per cent in July_August (Chart II.13). The edging down of inflation in July and August was due to lower inflation prints in pan, tobacco and intoxicants, clothing and footwear, and miscellaneous groups.Inflation in respect of both goods and services in the CPI excluding food, fuel, petrol and diesel edged up during Q1:2018-19 (Chart II.16). For goods, inflation picked up across commodity groups, particularly medicines, clothing and footwear, bedding, utensils and washing powder. However, during July-August 2018, goods inflation moderated sharply by 80 bps, driven primarily by a fall in inflation in pan, tobacco and intoxicants group and personal care and effects sub-group (Chart II.16a). Services inflation rose in H1:2018-19 to reach a peak of 6.9 per cent in June, driven up largely by the HRA increases and an increase in tuition fees and prices of transportation services, as alluded to earlier. As the HRA effects started to wane, services inflation moderated to 6.5 per cent in August (Chart II.16b). Excluding the HRA impact, services inflation rose from 5.0 per cent in March and remained steady at 5.5 per cent during June-August. Communication services inflation, however, remained muted due to subdued prices in respect of cellular services."
other,"Growth in the Singapore economy is expected to be slower this year after the rapid pace in 2006, reflecting the moderation in the global economy and IT industry.

flood,"Heavy rain, floods kill at least 17 in Sri Lanka, force thousands from their homes Heavy rain has lashed Sri Lanka triggering floods and landslides that have killed at least 17 people and forced tens of thousands from their homes, officials said on Monday.  After days of rain, rivers on the island nation’s southern and western plains overflowed on the weekend, inundating low-lying areas and forcing thousands into relief centres  “Water levels are receding but landslide warnings are still in place in 10 districts,” Pradeep Kodippili, assistant director of the National Disaster Management Centre, said in a statement.  More than 270,000 people have been affected and about 100,000 buildings lost power, he added."
drought,"A megadrought worse than any in “known prehistory” may already be underway in the western United States and northern Mexico, researchers have suggested.
After experiencing a wetter-than-average 20th century, the region has been suffering an ever-lengthening string of dry years starting in 2000, and scientists have now warned the worsening climate crisis is partly responsible for pushing the region towards extreme long-term drought.
The study is based on modern weather observations, along with 1,200 years of tree-ring data and dozens of climate models.
“Earlier studies were largely model projections of the future,” said lead author Park Williams, a bioclimatologist at Columbia University‘s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.
“We’re no longer looking at projections, but at where we are now. We now have enough observations of current drought and tree-ring records of past drought to say that we’re on the same trajectory as the worst prehistoric droughts.”
Reliable modern observations date only to about 1900, but tree rings have allowed scientists to infer yearly soil moisture for centuries before humans began influencing the climate.
The study has rung alarm bells, as previous research has linked the catastrophic ancient droughts recorded in tree rings to concurrent upheavals among indigenous medieval-era civilisations in the southwest US.
The new study is the most up-to-date and comprehensive long-term analysis, the researchers have said. It covers an area stretching across nine US states from Oregon and Montana down through California and New Mexico, and part of northern Mexico.
Using rings from thousands of trees, the researchers charted dozens of droughts across the region, starting in 800 AD.
Four stand out as so-called megadroughts, with extreme aridity lasting decades: the late 800s, mid-1100s, the 1200s, and the late 1500s. After 1600, there were other droughts, but none on such a large scale.
The team then compared the ancient megadroughts to soil moisture records calculated from observed weather in the years from 2000 to 2018.
They found the current drought is already outdoing the three earliest ones. The fourth, which spanned 1575 to 1603, may have been the worst of all — but the difference is slight enough to be within the range of uncertainty.
Furthermore, the current drought is affecting wider areas more consistently than any of the earlier ones — this is the “fingerprint” of climate change and associated temperatures, the researchers said.
All of the ancient droughts lasted longer than 19 years — the one that started in the 1200s ran for nearly a century — but all began by following a similar path to what is happening now, they said.
The ancient droughts weren’t driven by manmade climate change, and nature is still playing a strong role today.
A study last year led by Nathan Steiger at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University showed among other things, that unusually cool periodic conditions over the tropical Pacific Ocean (commonly called La Ni?a) during the previous megadroughts pushed storm tracks further north, and starved the region of precipitation."
other,"In the fifth bi-monthly statement of December, headline inflation was projected at 5 per cent in Q4 of 2016-17 with risks lower than before but still tilted to the upside. The decline in headline CPI inflation in November and December has been larger than expected, but almost exclusively on the back of deflation in vegetables and pulses. While the seasonal ebb in the prices of vegetables that usually occurs with the onset of winter as well as some demand compression may have contributed to this outcome, anecdotal evidence points to some distress sales of perishables having accentuated the decline in vegetable prices, with spillovers into January as well. Looking beyond, prices of pulses are likely to remain soft with comfortable supply conditions, while vegetable prices may potentially rebound as the effects of demonetisation wear off.The Committee is of the view that the persistence of inflation excluding food and fuel could set a floor on further downward movements in headline inflation and trigger second-order effects. Nevertheless, headline CPI inflation in Q4 of 2016-17 is likely to be below 5 per cent. Favourable base effects and lagged effects of demand compression may mute headline inflation in Q1 of 2017-18. Thereafter, it is expected to pick up momentum, especially as growth picks up and the output gap narrows. Moreover, base effects will reverse and turn adverse during Q3 and Q4 of 2017-18. Accordingly, inflation is projected in the range of 4.0 to 4.5 per cent in the first half of the financial year and in the range of 4.5 to 5.0 per cent in the second half with risks evenly balanced around this projected path (Chart 1). In this context, it is important to note three significant upside risks that impart some uncertainty to the baseline inflation path _ the hardening profile of international crude prices; volatility in the exchange rate on account of global financial market developments, which could impart upside pressures to domestic inflation; and the fuller effects of the house rent allowances under the 7th Central Pay Commission (CPC) award which have not been factored in the baseline inflation path. The focus of the Union budget on growth revival without compromising on fiscal prudence should bode well for limiting upside risks to inflation.GVA growth for 2016-17 is projected at 6.9 per cent with risks evenly balanced around it. Growth is expected to recover sharply in 2017-18 on account of several factors. First, discretionary consumer demand held back by demonetisation is expected to bounce back beginning in the closing months of 2016-17. Second, economic activity in cash-intensive sectors such as retail trade, hotels and restaurants, and transportation, as well as in the unorganised sector, is expected to be rapidly restored. Third, demonetisation-induced ease in bank funding conditions has led to a sharp improvement in transmission of past policy rate reductions into marginal cost-based lending rates (MCLRs), and in turn, to lending rates for healthy borrowers, which should spur a pick-up in both consumption and investment demand. Fourth, the emphasis in the Union Budget for 2017-18 on stepping up capital expenditure, and boosting the rural economy and affordable housing should contribute to growth. Accordingly, GVA growth for 2017-18 is projected at 7.4 per cent, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2)."
other,"Monetary policy is essentially the way in which the Federal Reserve controls the quantity of money in the economy and the avenues in which new money is injected into it. The Fed¡¯s motivation in conducting monetary policy is in following the mandate by Congress to fulfill three goals: maximize employment, stabilize prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. This directive is satisfied when citizens who are looking for work are ¡°gainfully employed¡± and when the prices for goods/services are comparatively stable. The Federal Reserve has three tools at its disposal to conduct monetary policy: open market operations, the discount rate, and reserve requirements. These three tools are actually controlled by two different entities. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve system is responsible for setting the discount rate and the reserve requirements. The Federal Open Market Committee is responsible for open market operations. In order to better understand the tools that the Federal Reserve uses, we¡¯ll define them here so that you can develop a deeper understanding as we go along: "
other,"As has been the case for some years now, growth of Australia's major trading partners remains close to its long-run average, notwithstanding a slight easing in the June quarter. Growth of global industrial production has moderated over the past year or so, which has contributed to lower commodity prices, although the strength of commodity supply has also been a significant factor. In most of Australia's trading partners, core inflation has been stable in year-ended terms over recent months at rates below central bank targets. Globally, monetary conditions remain very accommodative and finance remains readily available to creditworthy borrowers.In China, GDP growth picked up in the June quarter, remaining at 7 per cent in year-ended terms, which is the government's target for this year. However, a range of indicators suggest that growth of consumption and industrial production, including steel production, moderated in the first half of 2015. Low inflation has given the authorities scope to adopt more accommodative monetary and fiscal policy settings. Conditions in residential property markets have improved in some respects, although this has yet to translate into a pick-up in residential property investment outside the largest cities. The recent volatility in Chinese equity markets is unlikely to have a significant direct effect on consumption, given the relatively limited exposure of households to equities. Growth in the rest of east Asia (excluding Japan) was a little below average in the first half of 2015, owing to some weakness in domestic and external demand. Meanwhile, output in advanced economies has generally been increasing at a moderate pace and labour market conditions have been improving, supported by expansionary monetary policy. In Japan, the relatively tight labour market conditions have resulted in wage growth being higher than it was a year ago. The US economy returned to moderate growth in the June quarter, following temporary weakness earlier in the year. Although the Federal Reserve is widely expected to start raising interest rates later this year, monetary conditions will remain very accommodative for some time."
wildfires,"On May 28, 2015, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Aqua satellite acquired this image of smoke from fires in Canada’s Northwest Territories. Red outlines indicate hot spots where MODIS detected unusually warm surface temperatures associated with fire.
Due to a dry spring, forecasts suggested that the territory would see above-average fire danger in May and June. The May 29 wildfire situation report, issued by the Northwest Territories Department of Environment and Natural Resources, noted that there have been 46 total fires so far in 2015 affecting 406 square kilometers (157 square miles). Two of the three most recent fires prior to the report were caused by people: one from an abandoned campfire and another from grass burning. The third was caused by lightning. According to news reports, the summer season in the Northwest Territories was expected to see a return to more normal fire conditions.
Meanwhile, fires burning in Alberta, Canada, (south of this image) displaced thousands of residents and led some energy companies to suspend oil operations. CBC News reported that as of May 28, the Wabasca wildfire was under control, but dry conditions in that province remained a concern. Lighting was responsible for almost half of the 44 fires burning on May 28 across the province."

The policy band was re-centred downwards in April last year, and kept at that level during the last policy announcement in October.  This policy stance was assessed to be appropriate, given continuing weakness and uncertainties in global and domestic economic prospects.Over the past six months, the S$NEER (Chart 1) has fluctuated in the upper half of the policy band, reflecting growing optimism about the strength of the economic recovery in Asia.  Meanwhile, the domestic three-month interbank rate has stabilised at a low level of 0.69% since early last year, reflecting the abundant liquidity conditions globally."

drought,"The severe drought in northeast Cambodia is forecast to further worsen this week, the Mekong River Commission (MRC) warned. Elsewhere across the country, more rain is expected until August 11, according to the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology (MOWRAM).
The dry spell around the Sekong, Sesan, and Srepok rivers are set to intensify this week and expand to large areas of Rattanakiri and Stung Treng provinces by Sunday, August 9.
The dry conditions are also forecast to extend to a portion of southern Laos, while severe drought is expected to hit Kratie and Mondulkiri provinces, as well as Vietnam's Central Highland.
Moderate drought conditions will reach central Laos and adjacent areas in northeast Thailand on the same day.
""Low-density rainfall in July is the main factor causing deficit soil moisture in the two driest areas of the LMB during the forecasting week,"" said the MRC Flood and Drought Management Center.
Elsewhere across Cambodia, low to heavy rain is forecast until August 11, MOWRAM said in a new forecast. People were advised to remain alert as thunderstorms, wind gusts, and high waves may take place.
During this period, temperatures in central lowland areas may vary between 25 and 32 °C (77 and 90 °F), 23 to 30 °C (73 to 86 °F) in the mountainous areas in the north and northeast, and between 24 and 32 °C (75 and 90 °F) in the coastal areas."
earthquake,"Magnitude 7.7 earthquake strikes off the coast of Jamaica and is felt as far away as Miami A magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck Tuesday about 80 miles from Jamaica, shaking people in the Caribbean and as far away as Miami. A tsunami of 0.4 feet was recorded in the Cayman Islands at George Town, but no tsunami was observed at Port Royal, Jamaica, or Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic. There were several aftershocks, including one the US Geological Survey said had a magnitude of 6.1. ""Based on all available data, there is no significant tsunami threat from this (6.1) earthquake. However, there is a very small possibility of tsunami waves along coasts located nearest the epicenter,"" the National Weather Service's Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said. The quakes come three weeks after a magnitude 6.4 earthquake struck Puerto Rico. A tsunami threat alert was lifted Tuesday afternoon, a few hours after the quake. Earlier, a tsunami of 0.4 feet was recorded in the Cayman Islands at George Town, but no tsunami was observed at Port Royal, Jamaica or Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic. Alec Pultr, who lives in Ogier, Grand Cayman, said it wasn't the first earthquake he's experienced but it was the biggest ""by far."" ""We were simply working and things started to sway,"" he told CNN. As the swaying and shaking became more violent, most people started to run; the ones who stayed behind got under their desks."
other,"The risks to this outlook remain to the downside.  The risks include the possibilities that the housing market or labor market may deteriorate more than is currently anticipated and that credit conditions may tighten substantially further.Consumer price inflation has increased since our previous report, in substantial part because of the steep run-up in the price of oil.  Last year, food prices also increased significantly, and the dollar depreciated.  Reflecting these influences, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) increased 3.4 percent over the four quarters of 2007, up from 1.9 percent in 2006.  Core price inflation--that is, inflation excluding food and energy prices--also firmed toward the end of the year.  The higher recent readings likely reflected some pass-through of energy costs to the prices of core consumer goods and services as well as the effect of the depreciation of the dollar on import prices.  Moreover, core inflation in the first half of 2007 was damped by a number of transitory factors--notably, unusually soft prices for apparel and for financial services--which subsequently reversed.  For the year as a whole, however, core PCE prices increased 2.1 percent, down slightly from 2006.The projections recently submitted by FOMC participants indicate that overall PCE inflation was expected to moderate significantly in 2008, to between 2.1 percent and 2.4 percent (the central tendency of the projections).  A key assumption underlying those projections was that energy and food prices would begin to flatten out, as was implied by quotes on futures markets.  In addition, diminishing pressure on resources is also consistent with the projected slowing in inflation.  The central tendency of the projections for core PCE inflation in 2008, at 2.0 percent to 2.2 percent, was a bit higher than in our July report, largely because of some higher-than-expected recent readings on prices.  Beyond 2008, both overall and core inflation were projected to edge lower, as participants expected inflation expectations to remain reasonably well-anchored and pressures on resource utilization to be muted.  The inflation projections submitted by FOMC participants for 2010--which ranged from 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent for overall PCE inflation--were importantly influenced by participants' judgments about the measured rates of inflation consistent with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate and about the time frame over which policy should aim to attain those rates."
other,"When Tim Cook took over as chief executive of Apple, it was a corporate transition unlike any other. He stepped out from the shadow of one of the best-known American CEOs and took the reins of one of the world's biggest tech companies facing some uncertainty about how much more successful it could be.
Ten years into the job, Cook now leads the most valuable company in the world — technology or otherwise — and it remains among the most influential. More than a billion people worldwide use its devices and tens of millions of developers have built businesses on its software platforms.
Cook took over as CEO from Steve Jobs on August 24, 2011, less than two months before the Apple founder passed away. Since then, Apple's (AAPL) market capitalization has grown around 600% to nearly $2.5 trillion, and its annual revenue has more than doubled.
If Jobs was known for his ability to create groundbreaking devices that redefined consumers' experience of technology, Cook may come to be known for expanding the Apple ecosystem — building a suite of subscription services and other hardware products that complement the core iPhone business Jobs launched.
Cook with James Corden and Pharrell during a taped comedy bit shown on a projection screen during an Apple event in San Francisco on September 7, 2016. 
Under Cook, Apple has gone from a premium device maker to a massive, multifaceted company with businesses ranging from payment services to an Oscar-nominated TV and film production studio. He's overseen the acquisition of more than 100 companies, including the $3 billion Beats purchase in 2014 and the $1 billion acquisition of Intel's smartphone modem business in 2019.
Inside Apple, Cook inherited a company culture known for being relentlessly demanding and he's now managing at a time where tech workers have been increasingly vocal about social issues. (Cook himself, who in 2014 became one of the first leading CEOs to come out as gay, has been involved in LGBTQ+ rights advocacy.)
Cook has also been at the helm for major corporate missteps such as ""Batterygate"" and allegations of poor labor conditions at its suppliers' factories. A recent announcement around a new child protection initiative also turned into an unexpected PR nightmare. And he has navigated a host of external threats to Apple's business over the years, including, recently, feuds with the Trump administration, the US-China trade war and the Covid-19 pandemic.
What Cook hasn't done is launch another product as successful and disruptive as the iPhone, but he's found ways to keep Apple growing without that.
""It's possibly the most successful handoff from strength to strength in corporate history,"" Mike Bailey, director of research at FBB Capital Partners, said of the transition from Jobs to Cook. ""Apple, frankly, needed a cheerleader and a politician, possibly more than a micromanaging, stressed out founder.""
Bailey added: ""You're maintaining the empire, as opposed to building one."""
wildfires,"Smoke from the fires devastating swathes of the US West Coast has reached as far as Europe, the European Union's climate monitoring service said Wednesday in its assessment of the ""unprecedented"" blazes.
Satellite data from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) showed that the wildfires currently raging across California, Oregon and Washington State are ""tens to hundreds of times more intense"" than the recent average.
Thanks to strong pressure systems, the smoke from the fires was trapped along the western part of North America for days, making for potentially dangerous air quality in major cities such as Portland, Oregon and Vancouver and San Francisco.
But the weather shifted on Monday, carrying the smoke east along the jet stream. The site NY Metro Weather said Tuesday that it was visible in the skies above New York.
CAMS said that it had tracked the long-range transport of smoke particles from the fires as far as 8,000 kilometres to the east -- reaching northern Europe.
It estimated that the blazes, which are significantly more likely to occur as the planet warms, have spewed out more than 30 million tonnes of carbon dioxide since mid-August.
""The scale and magnitude of these fires are at a level much higher than any of the 18 years that our monitoring data covers"" since 2003, said Mark Parrington, CMAS senior scientist and wildfire expert.
""The fact that these fires are emitting so much pollution into the atmosphere that we can still see thick smoke over 8000 kilometres away reflects just how devastating they have been in their magnitude and duration."""
Typhoon,"Tokyo: Hundreds fled their homes on Sunday on a Japanese island already devastated by a typhoon for fear that torrential rain would trigger fresh mudslides.
The town of Oshima, 120 kilometres south of Tokyo, advised 2,300 residents in two districts on the island of the same name to evacuate, saying rain was expected to intensify due to a depression.
A total of 632 people had taken shelter in school gyms and community halls by early afternoon, an official at the town’s administrative office said.
Many others were staying at relatives’ homes in safer areas of the island, she said.
The meteorological agency has warned that rainfall could reach 40 millimetres per hour in the afternoon and has urged residents to be on alert.
The rain could trigger fresh landslides on the island where at least 27 residents were killed as a typhoon struck last week. Two others died in or near Tokyo.
Twenty-one people were still missing but search operations were suspended due to the bad weather.
Military airplanes flew 14 inpatients at the island’s medical centre to hospitals in central Tokyo while Prime Minister Shinzo Abe cancelled his visit to the island set for Sunday.
Powerful typhoon Wipha triggered mudslides that buried some 30 houses and damaged more than 300 structures on Oshima last week.
Empress Michiko cancelled events scheduled Sunday at the imperial palace in Tokyo to celebrate her 79th birthday in the wake of the disaster.
An even stronger typhoon was churning north in the Pacific towards the Japanese archipelago.
Super Typhoon Francisco, currently packing winds of up to 198 kilometres per hour near its centre, is expected to be off the coast of Japan later in the week, according to the weather agency."
Typhoon,"The US Midwest will be hit with blizzards and gale-force winds this week, forecasters have said, as a powerful storm threatens to trigger more flooding in the region.
High spring temperatures are today expected to give way to heavy snow and life-threatening conditions across a swath of the central US.
Patrick Burke, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service (NWS), warned that the storm could cause widespread power outages and road closures.
“This is potentially a life-threatening storm,” he told Reuters. “It’s slow moving. It won’t push farther east until Friday.”
The storm has already sparked flood evacuations in Oregon and caused flooding in Washington state.
Some areas of western Minnesota and southeast South Dakota are likely to experience up to 30 inches snow.
The same region is still recovering from last month’s ‘bomb cyclone’ which brought deadly flooding and blizzards, causing billions of dollars in damage.
The NWS said that the coming storm is likely to exacerbate flooding along the Missouri River in areas where dozens of levees were breached in March.
The storm is expected to weaken and push off into the Great Lakes area and northern Michigan on Friday, bringing more rain and snow, forecasters said."
wildfires,"Australian authorities warned on Friday of severe fire danger in densely populated areas this weekend, declaring a state of emergency in the capital, Canberra, as soaring temperatures and strong whipped up huge, unpredictable blazes.
With temperatures above 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit), emergency officials urged people to prepare for fires in parts of the southeast including hundreds of miles of coast south of Sydney that has already been badly hit in months of blazes.
""Tomorrow will be the peak of the heatwave in NSW with some areas expected to reach extreme heatwave conditions,"" the New South Wales (NSW) state Rural Fire Service said in a Facebook post late on Friday.
Australia's bushfires that have killed 33 people and an estimated 1 billion native animals since September. About 2,500 homes have been destroyed as more than 11.7 million hectares (117,000 sq km) have been razed.
Andrew Barr, chief minister of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), said the area's first state of emergency since fatal wildfires in 2003 indicated the danger this weekend. Four people were killed and almost 500 homes destroyed in 2003.
Officials said an out-of-control fire in the ACT's south, on the doorstep of Canberra, had grown to 185 sq km, almost 8% of the territory's land mass.
""This fire may become very unpredictable. It may become uncontrollable,"" Barr said in a televised briefing. ""The combination of extreme heat, wind, and a dry landscape will place suburbs in Canberra's south at risk.""
The state of emergency will run for 72 hours, giving authorities greater powers to order evacuations, close roads and take control of property.
Victoria state, which adjoins NSW and ACT, is also expected to see heatwave conditions on the weekend.
In neighbouring New Zealand, where smoke from the Australian blazes has turned glaciers brown, firefighters were battling to contain about 25 fires that spread rapidly to cover about 100 hectares on the South Island. Heatwave conditions were also forecast for much of the country over the weekend."
drought,"The New Zealand army has been deployed to drought-stricken Northland to assist in relief efforts amid worsening drought conditions. Authorities described the situation as the worst drought on record.
The National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) said the severe drought is widespread across Northland, Auckland, and Waikato regions of the North Island, with medium-level droughts in the southern parts as well.
In Auckland city, just 5 mm (0.19 inches) of rain was recorded at the Motat weather station in January, which is the lowest since 1948 and just 7% of normal. Whenuapai had 7 mm (0.27 inches) of rain, the lowest since 1943 and 9% of normal.
North Shore marked its second-lowest rainfall total since 1966 with just 5 mm (0.19 inches) falling over the first month of the year.
The towns of Kaikohe and Kaitaia are the worst-affected, with severe water restrictions in force throughout February-- water is strictly for cooking and drinking only, or 40-second showers.
""We're running out of water,"" said the Far North council, adding that the goal is to promptly lessen water usage across the district by 25 percent.
There has been no major rainfall since November 2019, and areas of the North Island are facing its longest dry spell for seven years. According to weather forecasters, the drought conditions will continue as no significant rainfall is expected through the end of March.
""This is as probably as serious as it gets; this is the worst drought we've had on record,"" Kaitaia mayor John Carter said.
Soldiers from the NZ army has been deployed in the region and will be based in Kaitaia for two weeks. Furthermore, three medium-heavy army vehicles carrying huge loads of water were sent to Northland to help refill storage tanks in affected towns.
""It’s getting close to running out in 10 days or so if we keep taking at the rate we are, we could run out of water in the streams, which is significant,"" said Carter."

wildfires,"Wildfires burned out of control on Friday across California, killing at least nine people in a mountain town and forcing residents to flee the upscale beach community of Malibu in the face of a monster fire storm.
All nine victims were found in and around the Northern California town of Paradise, where more than 6,700 homes and businesses were burned down by the Camp Fire, making it one of the most destructive in state history, according to California Department of Forestry and Fire protection data.
""This event was the worst-case scenario. It was the event we have feared for a long time,"" Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said at a Friday evening press conference. ""Regrettably, not everybody made it out.""
The remains of five of the victims were discovered in or near burned out cars, three outside residences and one inside a home, Honea said.
Another 35 people had been reported missing and three firefighters had been injured.
The flames descended on Paradise so quickly that many people were forced to abandon their cars and run for their lives down the sole road through the mountain town.
A school bus was among several abandoned vehicles left blackened by flames on one road.
The Camp Fire, which broke out on Thursday at the edge of the Plumas National Forest northeast of Sacramento, has since blackened more than 90,000 acres and was only 5 percent contained as of nightfall on Friday.
A total of 6,453 homes had been destroyed in Paradise and elsewhere, Honea said, along with 260 commercial buildings. The Tubbs Fire, which destroyed 5,636 structures in Napa and Sonoma counties in October 2017, is listed by Cal Fire as the most destructive in state history."

Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency Saturday. Cristobal was upgraded from a tropical depression to a tropical storm over Mexico on Tuesday, becoming the third named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season. The National Hurricane Center said Cristobal's maximum sustained winds had strengthened to 50 mph Saturday evening. The storm was centered about 235 miles south of the mouth of the Mississippi River. Cristobal is not expected to become a hurricane, which typically have wind speeds of 75 mph. “The tropical storm-force winds extend outward at least 24 miles from the center,” meteorologist Dennis Feltgen said. “That's a big storm.” Landfall and tropical cyclones also trigger the possibility of tornadoes, Dennis cautioned. Heavy rainfall is expected this weekend and early next week in areas of the Mid-South and Gulf Coast from East Texas to Florida, the National Hurricane Center said. Flooding is predicted to reach as high as five feet above ground level along the mouth of the Mississippi River and Ocean Springs, up to four feet along the Morgan City shoreline and between one and three feet along the rest of the gulf. “We put our disaster teams and 70 mobile feeding units on standby,” Salvation Army Southern Territory Disaster Coordinator Jeff Jellets said. “We’re staying in close coordination with local officials, monitoring the storm path and, once the storm makes landfall, getting damage assessments.”"

For example, in 1967, the United Kingdom had difficulty maintaining its peg, so it devalued the pound. This boosted exports but also raised inflation.Challenges in the United States ultimately led to Bretton Woods¡¯ demise. Large trade deficits with West Germany and Japan and large budget deficits under the Johnson and Nixon administrations led to more U.S. dollars held abroad. Eventually, there was not enough U.S. gold to redeem those dollars. Recognizing this, speculators sold their dollars, causing ¡°runs¡± on the currency and making it even more difficult for the United States to maintain its exchange rates with other countries. Nixon suspended the dollar¡¯s conversion into gold, and although he announced that the suspension would be temporary, the system was never salvaged.While one can argue that Bretton Woods used a poorly designed gold standard ¡ª giving too much room to governments to pursue monetary and fiscal policies and creating tension within the system ¡ª this does not mean we should return to another gold standard, even one like the relatively well-functioning pre-World War I classical gold standard."
wildfires,"In the last 48 hours, 852 homes have been consumed in the flames of Texas wildfires as dozens of blazes continue to sear the drought-plagued state, according to the Texas Forest Service.
Officials say more than 1,000 homes have been destroyed and over 115,000 acres have burned in the past seven days.
The largest wildfire is raging just east of Austin and has burned at least 600 homes and blackened 30,000 acres.
Texas Gov. Rick Perry set aside his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination to focus attention on the emergency at home. He cut short a campaign stop in South Carolina and returned to Texas on Monday. He says his participation in Wednesday's debate in California is a ""fluid situation.""
""I'll be real honest with you, I'm not paying any attention to politics right now,"" Perry said. ""There's plenty of time to take care of that. People's lives and their possessions are in danger. That's substantially more important.""
""I have seen a number of big fires in my life ... this one is as mean looking as I've ever seen,"" he added.
The wall of smoke and flames, 16 miles long and 4 miles wide, has resulted in the evacuation of more than 5,000 people. Five shelters have been set up across the affected area.
The massive wildfire began Sunday afternoon in Bastrop County and is zero percent contained. Texas Forest Service spokeswoman Victoria Koenig said that they expect the wind that has been fueling the flames to die down today, but that it is still a ""tough, tough fire.""
The emergency is not limited to the one fire about 30 miles east of Austin. Roughly 35 other fires are actively burning across this drought-stricken state.
Many Texans prayed Tropical Lee would bring rain, but instead only gusty winds made Texas' most active fire season ever that much worse. The state is experiencing its worst drought since the 1950s.
In the past nine months, Texas has experienced six of the ten largest wildfires in its history and since November 3,523 homes and structures have been lost to the flames, according to the Texas Forest Service."
wildfires,"In the tinder-dry U.S. West, where campfires, fireworks and even lit cigarettes are banned across public lands, another fire-starting culprit remains free of most restrictions: guns.
This year, officials believe target shooting or other firearms use have sparked at least 21 wildfires in Utah and nearly a dozen in Idaho. Shooting is also believed to have caused fires in Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico.
Officials have been asking the public to scale back shooting as legions of firefighters contend with one of the busiest and most destructive wildfire seasons to ever hit the West.
But many in the region avid proponents of the Second Amendment right to bear arms, so most state lawmakers are hesitant to enact any formal restrictions.
""We're not trying to pull away anyone's right to bear arms. I want to emphasize that,"" said Louinda Downs, a county commissioner in fire-prone Davis County, Utah. ""We're just saying, target practice in winter. Target practice on the gun range. When your pleasure hobby is infringing or threatening someone else's right to have property or life, shouldn't we be able to somehow have some authority so we can restrict that?""
The state's Republican Gov. Gary Herbert took the unusual step of authorizing the top state forest official to impose gun restrictions on public lands after a gunfire-sparked fire. Herbert said his decision doesn't limit gun rights, but is a common-sense response to dry conditions."
valcano eruption,"Why the volcano erupting in the Caribbean has such a deadly reputation Since December 2020, a strange and gloopy mass of lava has been oozing from the top of La Soufrière, a volcano on the northern side of the Caribbean island of St. Vincent. This eruption posed no real threat to the 110,000 or so people living on the island, but things took a turn for the worse at the end of March, when the volcano began shaking in a way that suggested something more violent was coming. Sure enough, at 8:41 a.m. local time today, the first of several major explosions rocked the mountain, kicking off a more dangerous phase of the eruption. The situation on the island is extremely febrile: Anywhere from 20,000 to 30,000 people in the north needed evacuation, either off-island via boat, or to the island’s south via a single, jam-packed road. The process began the day before the blast and was still ongoing as the eruptions began."
other,"Recent data have continued to indicate strong growth in the Australian economy, with demand and activity rising faster than trend, confidence high and labour market conditions tight. In recent quarters these conditions have been accompanied by an increase in underlying inflation.Growth of the Australian economy has for some time been assisted by strong global demand and high commodity prices. Supportive conditions appear likely to continue, though some moderation in the pace of global expansion is now occurring, partly as a result of recent strains in financial markets. In the United States, the sharp downturn in the housing sector is weighing on growth, and may do so for a while longer. Nonetheless, other parts of the US economy have so far been resilient, with recent outcomes for aggregate output and employment remaining relatively strong. The Japanese and euro area economies have been slowing recently, though moderate growth appears to be continuing. In contrast, the major developing countries, especially China, are growing rapidly, and indeed have strengthened further since the start of the year. The net effect of these contrasting trends is that world growth in 2008 is likely to moderate, though most official and private-sector observers still expect the pace to remain higher than average."
drought,"International charities have issued a stark warning about a looming humanitarian catastrophe in Ethiopia. The North African country has been hit by its worst drought for 50 years. It is widely expected that emergency food aid for 10 million Ethiopians will run out unless more funds can be found. John Graham, the head of the charity Save the Children in Ethiopia, said: ""The international community has just three weeks to provide $245 million in emergency food aid to help prevent a potentially catastrophic escalation in severe malnutrition cases."" He added that: ""If these emergency funds do not arrive in time, there is no question that there will be a critical fracture in the food aid supply pipeline.""
Ethiopia is Africa’s second most populous country. It is no stranger to natural disasters of this kind. Famine killed over one million Ethiopians in 1984. The latest drought was brought on by the El Nino weather phenomenon, which has caused drought and flooding across much of Africa. Ethiopia is one of the countries hardest hit. Charities say that over 400,000 Ethiopian children under the age of five will suffer from severe malnutrition this year. In addition, 1.7 million under-fives, pregnant women and breast-feeding mothers will need treatment for malnutrition. Mr Graham warned that, ""the window for action is rapidly closing"" as it can take four months to buy food aid and transport it into the landlocked country."
other,"Residential investment also expanded considerably in 2005, supported by a strong real estate market. However, as I have already noted, some signs of slowing in the housing market have appeared in recent months: Home sales have softened, the inventory of unsold homes has risen, and indicators of homebuilder and homebuyer sentiment have turned down. Anecdotal information suggests that homes typically are on the market somewhat longer than they were a year or so ago, and the frequency of contract offers above asking prices reportedly has diminished. Financial market conditions seem to be consistent with some moderation in housing activity. Interest rates on thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages, which were around 5-3/4 percent over much of 2005, rose noticeably in the final months of the year to their current level of around 6-1/4 percent. Rates on adjustable-rate mortgages have climbed more considerably. Still, despite the recent increases, mortgage rates remain relatively low. Low mortgage rates, together with expanding payrolls and incomes and the need to rebuild after the hurricanes, should continue to support the housing market. Thus, at this point, a leveling out or a modest softening of housing activity seems more likely than a sharp contraction, although significant uncertainty attends the outlook for home prices and construction. In any case, the Federal Reserve will continue to monitor this sector closely.Overall, the financial health of households appears reasonably good. Largely reflecting the growth in home mortgages, total household debt continued to expand rapidly in 2005. But the value of household assets also continued to climb strongly, driven by gains in home prices and equity shares. To some extent, sizable increases in household wealth, as well as low interest rates, have contributed in recent years to the low level of personal saving. Saving last year was probably further depressed by the rise in households' energy bills. Over the next few years, saving relative to income is likely to rise somewhat from its recent low level."
Typhoon,"Storm-weary Louisiana is once again under a hurricane warning, with Zeta leaving Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula on a path that could hit New Orleans Wednesday night.
Zeta, the 27th named storm in a very busy Atlantic season, made landfall just north of the ancient Mayan city of Tulum with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph (130 kph). It weakened to a tropical storm as it crossed over land, but it was expected to regain its strength over the Gulf of Mexico.
Zeta’s top winds were 70 mph (110 kmh) early Tuesday, centered about 560 miles (905 kmh) south of the mouth of the Mississippi River. If Zeta makes landfall in Louisiana, it will be the fifth named storm to hit the state this year, joining Cristobal, Laura, Marco and Delta."
Typhoon,"A powerful typhoon has hit South Korea with strong winds and heavy rain, killing nine and churning up rough seas that smashed two Chinese fishing ships into rocks and forced the coast guard to perform a daring rescue of survivors.
Rescuers saved 12 fishermen and searched for 10 still missing from the ships that hit rocks off South Korea's southern Jeju island. Five fishermen were killed, officials said.
Separately, at least four other people died as Typhoon Bolaven knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of South Koreans, cancelled flights and temporarily halted joint war games by U.S. and South Korean military forces.
North Korea, which is still struggling to rebuild from massive floods and a devastating drought before that, was next in the typhoon's path. State media reported the country was being lashed by heavy rain and strong wind on Tuesday.
Off Jeju island, dangerous waves kept rescue vessels from approaching the Chinese fishing ships. The coast guard used a special gun to shoot rope to one ship so officers could pull themselves over and bring the fishermen back to shore, coast guard spokesman Ko Chang-keon said.
Eighteen fishermen survived. Twelve were rescued by the coast guard and the others swam or were washed ashore.
South Korea issued a storm warning for the capital, Seoul, as Bolaven battered the country's south and west, knocking over street lights and church spires and ripping signs from stores. A large container box crushed an apartment janitor to death, a woman fell to her death from a rooftop where she kept dried red peppers and a third person died after bricks hit a house, according to disaster and fire officials.
Strong wind gusts left Seoul streets covered with leaves, garbage and branches. More than 15,000 schools cancelled classes, and businesses and homes taped windows or pasted the glass with wet newspapers to keep them from shattering.
More than 330,000 South Korean households lost power, the government said, and more than 70 were left homeless because of floods or storm damage. Nearly 200 flights were cancelled."
Typhoon,"A tropical storm is gathering strength and is expected to become a hurricane by the time it hits Puerto Rico.
A state of emergency has been declared in the US territory as residents prepare for Dorian to bring the first hurricane of the season.
The National Hurricane Centre said the storm already has sustained winds of up to 50mph and is forecast to strengthen over the next 48 hours.
Officials have also issued tropical storm warnings for Martinique, St Lucia, and St Vincent and the Grenadines.
Barbados was hit by strong winds, rain and thunder and lightning on Monday night as Dorian passed, and residents were urged to remain indoors amid reports of power cuts.
The storm appeared to have caused little damage, however home affairs minister Edmund Hinkson urged residents to remain vigilant, adding: “We are not out of danger yet.”
By Tuesday morning the storm was about 30 miles southeast of St Lucia, blowing sustained winds of up to 50mph.
Officials warned it could become a hurricane by the time it passes the southwest side of Puerto Rico on Wednesday.
Hundreds of people in Puerto Rico have been stocking up on supplies at supermarkets and fuel stations in preparation for the storm."
Typhoon,"Associated Press quotes officials in the Philippines saying at least 13 people are dead in the wake of a powerful typhoon that swept through the northern part of the country early Saturday morning.
Officials say Typhoon Nari slammed into the east coast around midnight Friday, toppling trees and electric pylons, and dumping heavy rain across the rice-growing central plains of Luzon. Local authorities say the storm cut electricity to more than 2 million people.
Thousands of people were evacuated from coastal villages before the typhoon struck.
Nari forced U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry to cancel a trip to Manilla scheduled for Friday and Saturday. Kerry told reporters Thursday the he will try to reschedule the trip in the coming weeks."
earthquake,"Russia earthquake: tsunami warning cancelled after 7.5 magnitude event A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hit off Russia’s Kuril Islands on Wednesday, the US Geological Survey said, prompting a tsunami warning that was later cancelled. The quake hit at a depth of 59km (37 miles), around 1,400km north-east of the Japanese city of Sapporo, USGS added. There were no early reports of casualties. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre initially said hazardous tsunami waves were possible within 1,000km of the quake’s epicentre. It said earthquakes of this strength in the past had caused tsunamis far from the epicentre. But later it said “only very small tsunami waves were generated by this earthquake and there is no further threat”. “Tsunami waves are forecast to be less than 0.3 meters above the tide level,” the center said in its advisory about risks to the coasts of Hawaii, Japan, Russia and the Pacific islands of Midway, the Northern Marianas and Wake Island. Meteorological officials in Japan issued no alerts, although they said there might be slight tidal changes. A tsunami watch alert was issued for Hawaii and later cancelled. The four southernmost islands of the Kuril chain _ Habomai, Shikotan, Etorofu and Kunashiri _ have been disputed between Moscow and Tokyo since the end of the second world war. The Kurils are known as the Northern Territories in Japan."
valcano eruption,"DR Congo volcanic eruption leaves at least 15 dead A succession of small earthquakes has shaken the Congolese city of Goma, rattling a community already reeling from a volcanic eruption over the weekend. A wall of lava stopped just short of the city, but not before it had killed at least 15 people."
other,"With progressive remonetisation, the surplus liquidity in the banking system declined from a peak of _7,956 billion on January 4, 2017 to an average of _6,014 billion in February and further down to _4,806 billion in March. Currency in circulation expanded steadily during this period. Its impact on the liquidity overhang was, however, partly offset by a significant decline in cash balances of the Government up to mid-March which released liquidity into the system. Thereafter, the build-up of Government cash balances on account of advance tax payments and balance sheet adjustment by banks reduced surplus liquidity to _3,141 billion by end-March. Issuances of cash management bills (CMBs) under the market stabilisation scheme (MSS) ceased in mid-January and existing issues matured, with the consequent release of liquidity being absorbed primarily through variable rate reverse repo auctions of varying tenors. Accordingly, the average net absorption by the Reserve Bank increased from _2,002 billion in January to _4,483 billion in March. The weighted average call money rate (WACR) remained within the LAF corridor. The maturing of CMBs and reduced issuance of Treasury bills leading up to end-March has also contributed to Treasury bill rates being substantially below the policy rate.Merchandise exports rose strongly in February 2017 from a subdued profile in the preceding months. Growth impulses were broad-based, with major contributors being engineering goods, petroleum products, iron ore, rice and chemicals. The surge in imports in January and February 2017 largely reflected the effect of the hardening of commodity prices such as crude oil and coal. Non-oil non-gold imports continued to grow at a modest pace, though capital goods imports remained sluggish. With imports outpacing exports, the trade deficit widened in January and February from its level a year ago, though it was lower on a cumulative basis for the period April-February 2016-17.Balance of payments data for Q3 indicate that the current account deficit for the first three quarters of the financial year narrowed to 0.7 per cent of GDP, half of its level a year ago. For the year as a whole, the current account deficit is likely to remain muted at less than 1 per cent of GDP. Foreign direct investment (FDI) has dominated net capital inflows during April-December, with manufacturing, communication and financial services being the preferred sectors. Turbulence in global financial markets set off a bout of global risk aversion and flight to safe haven that caused net outflows of foreign portfolio investment (FPI) during November 2016 to January 2017. The tide reversed with the pricing in of the Fed¡¯s normalisation path and improvement in global growth prospects. FPI flows turned positive in February and welled up into a surge in March, especially in debt markets relative to equity markets (which had been the dominant recipient until February). This reversal appears to have been driven by stable domestic inflation, better than expected domestic growth, encouraging corporate earnings, clarity on FPI taxation, pro-reform budget proposals and state election results. The level of foreign exchange reserves was US$ 369.9 billion on March 31, 2017."
Typhoon,"Hundreds of trees were felled and power supply cut as the storm struck, state media said.
The typhoon left a trail of damage in South Korea, killing 15 people and leaving almost two million temporarily without power.
A search is continuing off Jeju island for 10 Chinese fishermen still missing in the wake of the storm.
Two boats capsized early on Tuesday as the typhoon hit the island, which is south of the Korean peninsula.
South Korean coast guards managed to rescue 12 people and another six swam ashore. But five were killed and the whereabouts of the remaining 10 crew members is unknown.
Across the country 10 South Koreans were killed and another two injured, Yonhap news agency reported."
other,"With the larger than anticipated deflation in vegetable prices in December bringing down headline closer to the target, it is likely that the food inflation trajectory will shape the near-term outlook. The bumper kharif crop, rising prospects of a good rabi harvest, larger winter arrivals of key vegetables and softer egg and poultry demand on avian flu fears are factors auguring a benign inflation outcome in the months ahead. On the other hand, price pressures may persist in respect of pulses, edible oils, spices and non-alcoholic beverages. The outlook for core inflation is likely to be impacted by further easing in supply chains; however, broad-based escalation in cost-push pressures in services and manufacturing prices due to increase in industrial raw material prices could impart upward pressure. Furthermore, there could be increased pass-through to output prices as demand normalises as indicated in the Reserve Bank¡¯s industrial outlook, services and infrastructure outlook surveys and purchasing managers¡¯ indices (PMIs) and firms regain pricing power. International crude oil prices may remain supported by demand build up on optimism from vaccination and continuing production cuts by OPEC plus. The crude oil futures curve has become downward sloping since December 2020. Taking into consideration all these factors, the projection for CPI inflation has been revised to 5.2 per cent in Q4:2020-21, 5.2 per cent to 5.0 per cent in H1:2021-22 and 4.3 per cent in Q3: 2021-22, with risks broadly balanced (Chart 1).Turning to the growth outlook, rural demand is likely to remain resilient on good prospects of agriculture. Urban demand and demand for contact-intensive services is expected to strengthen with the substantial fall in COVID-19 cases and the spread of vaccination. Consumer confidence is reviving and business expectations of manufacturing, services and infrastructure remain upbeat. The fiscal stimulus under AtmaNirbhar 2.0 and 3.0 schemes of government will likely accelerate public investment, although private investment remains sluggish amidst still low capacity utilisation. The Union Budget 2021-22, with its thrust on sectors such as health and well-being, infrastructure, innovation and research, among others, should help accelerate the growth momentum. Taking these factors into consideration, real GDP growth is projected at 10.5 per cent in 2021-22 _ in the range of 26.2 to 8.3 per cent in H1 and 6.0 per cent in Q3 (Chart 2).The MPC notes that the sharp correction in food prices has improved the food price outlook, but some pressures persist, and core inflation remains elevated. Pump prices of petrol and diesel have reached historical highs. An unwinding of taxes on petroleum products by both the centre and the states could ease the cost push pressures. What is needed at this point is to create conditions that result in a durable disinflation. This is contingent also on proactive supply side measures. Growth is recovering, and the outlook has improved significantly with the rollout of the vaccine programme in the country. The Union Budget 2021-22 has introduced several measures to provide an impetus to growth. The projected increase in capital expenditure augurs well for capacity creation thereby improving the prospects for growth and building credibility around the quality of expenditure. The recovery, however, is still to gather firm traction and hence continued policy support is crucial. Taking these developments into consideration, the MPC in its meeting today decided to continue with an accommodative stance of monetary policy till the prospects of a sustained recovery are well secured while closely monitoring the evolving outlook for inflation.All members of the MPC _ Dr. Shashanka Bhide; Dr. Ashima Goyal; Prof. Jayanth R. Varma; Dr. Mridul K. Saggar; Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra; and Shri Shaktikanta Das _ unanimously voted for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged at 4 per cent. Furthermore, all members of the MPC voted to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary _ at least during the current financial year and into the next financial year _ to revive growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward."

drought,"People in several Fort Myers neighborhoods are experiencing water shortages, as a drought persists in Southwest Florida, Friday.
Conditions have gotten so bad, the South Florida Water Management District issued a water shortage warning on Thursday. With more people in town during the dry season, demand for water is high, while supply is extremely low. The area has received nearly 6 inches less rain than average during this time of year, causing some wells to dry up. ""There's probably been three dozen or so wells in Lee County where wells have run dry,"" said Phil Flood from the South Florida Water Management District. ""This year, given the limited amount of rainfall we've had, we've really seen them lower than normal.”
This comes as several neighbors in the Florimond Manor area reported their private wells drying up. As a result, some have had to repair their systems, or drill deeper wells.
Neighbor Bernie Crews tells Fox 4 he is now watering his lawn only once a week, and hopes his neighbors do the same. He posted a sign at the corner of his street, asking his neighbors to conserve water in light of the warning. ""I wanted to let everyone in the neighborhood know that we're being affected by it and it's costing people money.""
He is referring the pricey repairs for well systems. If aquifer levels continue to sink, and motors continue running with no water to pump, those motors burn up. In that case, a contractor would have to elongate pipes into the well, or make the well deeper. ""You're looking at a $1,000 dollar repair, easy,"" said Crews."
other,"International economic conditions are continuing to support growth in Australia. The world economy is now in its fourth successive year of above-average growth, and most observers expect this to continue in the year ahead. While there have been signs of some moderation in the United States recently, this is currently being offset by stronger growth in other parts of the world. The Japanese economy is experiencing its best period of sustained expansion for some time. In China, recent indications are that the pace of growth has picked up this year from an already high rate. The performance of the smaller east Asian economies has remained solid, benefiting from the strength in China and in global electronics demand. There has also been a gradual improvement in conditions in the euro area.The strength of the global economy over recent years has been accompanied by sustained upward pressure on commodity prices. One important element of this has been the increase in crude oil prices during this period. Although events in the Middle East have recently contributed to the pressure on oil prices, their upward trend over the past few years has been mainly a consequence of strong global demand. The increases in commodity prices have been broadly based. Prices of Australia's base metals exports have increased by 40 per cent since the start of the year, following on from strong increases in each of the previous two years. In addition, contracts finalised in recent months for Australia's bulk commodity exports have provided for further rises in iron ore prices, while coal prices have fallen only modestly after their near-doubling last year. Overall, Australia's terms of trade are estimated to have increased by 6 per cent over the year to the June quarter, and by a cumulative 34 per cent since 2002."
other,"As noted, the NGDP gap requires an estimate of the neutral level of NGDP. The neutral level of NGDP is estimated by taking an average forecast of NGDP, or equivalent total nominal income, for a given quarter based on forecasts for that period from the preceding 20 quarters. The forecast data used here are taken from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia¡¯s Survey of Professional Forecasters.The NDGP gap measures the percentage difference between this average forecast and the actual level of NGDP. If the actual level of NGDP is less than the neutral level, then monetary conditions are contractionary. If actual NGDP is greater than the neutral level, then monetary conditions are expansionary.The rationale for this understanding is twofold. First, members of the public make many economic decisions, such as whether to take out a mortgage or a car loan, on the basis of forecasts of their nominal income. Similarly, firms may finance with debt and commit to multiyear contracts on plants, raw materials, and labor on the basis of forecasts of their nominal income. Second, actual nominal incomes may turn out to be very different from what are expected and, as a result, may be disruptive for households and firms that are not able to quickly adjust their economic plans. These disruptions can be avoided by maintaining total nominal income or NGDP on the growth path expected by the public. In other words, the Federal Reserve should aim to close the NGDP gap in order to keep monetary conditions neutral.To ensure robustness, I create a data series using real-time actual NGDP data (which are revised later). This series is called the vintage NGDP gap, and it contains initial-release NGDP data for each quarter. In other words, the series shows the NGDP gap, available in real time, given the initial NGDP data. In addition, I create a second version of the NGDP gap, the Blue Chip NGDP gap, using consensus forecasts from Blue Chip Economic Indicators instead of the Survey of Professional Forecasters. This measure provides a cross-check on the use of the Survey of Professional Forecasters. Both the vintage NGDP gap and the Blue Chip NGDP gap are shown in the figures below.For more information on how the NGDP gap is constructed and how it may be used to understand policy, please see ¡°The Stance of Monetary Policy: The NGDP Gap,¡± a policy brief by David Beckworth. Also, see the NGDP gap web page hosted by the Mercatus Center that provides access to current and vintage data on the NGDP gap.David Beckworth is the director of the Program on Monetary Policy at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University and a former international economist at the US Department of the Treasury. His research focuses on monetary policy, and his work has been cited by the Wall Street Journal, the Financial Times, the New York Times, Bloomberg Businessweek, and the Economist.

other,"Essential Quality, trained by Brad Cox and ridden by jockey Luis Saez, won the 153rd running of the Belmont Stakes on Saturday at Belmont Park in Elmont, New York.
The horse was the early betting favorite to win the 1.5-mile race and finished ahead of Hot Rod Charlie and the 146th Preakness Stakes winner Rombauer, who finished in second and third place, respectively.
Hot Rod Charlie was the early leader but Essential Quality passed him in the final turn and held on down the stretch to win. The win gave trainer Brad Cox his first Triple Crown victory.
A limited crowd of 11,000 were allowed to attend the ""Test of the Champion"" with proof of vaccination or a negative Covid-19 test required for entry.
This year's race did not include Medina Spirit, the Kentucky Derby winner, after the horse failed a post-Derby drug test. In May, the New York Racing Association temporarily suspended Medina Spirit's trainer Bob Baffert from entering any horses in races at the track that is host to the Belmont Stakes.
Baffert has been suspended from the home of the Kentucky Derby for two years after Medina Spirit's positive post-race drug was confirmed, the company that runs the Louisville racetrack said Wednesday."
Typhoon,"While it is difficult to link any individual tropical cyclone to climate change, the UN World Meteorological Organization (WMO) expects to see more powerful storms in future as a result of global warming. 
Laura is the seventh named storm to landfall in the US this season, which has just begun what is traditionally its most intense period. It intensified within 24 hours from a Category 1 to a strong Category 4 on the Saffir Simson hurricane scale.
According to news reports, some 1,500 people are being sent into Louisiana for rescue and clean up missions, including troops from the National Guard. 
Winds of up to 150 mph caused severe damage, including the death of at least six people, and left half a million homes without power.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards tweeted that the hurricane has left roads flooded and wildlife displaced, warning people to stay vigilant."
drought,"Idaho is facing unprecedented drought despite getting normal snow levels last winter, and water managers warn the state could be entering a dry spell that may last for years.
“Idaho is in the midst of a drought that is unprecedented in recent memory, mostly due to an exceptionally dry spring followed by a summer heat wave,” David Hoekema, hydrologist for the Idaho Department of Water Resources, wrote in a new analysis, the Idaho Press reported. “Without a snowpack that is significantly greater than normal next winter, Idaho could be seeing several years with limited water supply.”
Few saw this coming, as Idaho began the year with normal snowfall in the mountains, though temperatures were above normal every month but February. Then came a dry spring, followed by a blistering hot summer. The state’s basins all experienced the hottest June and July on record, Hoekema said.
“With storage being rapidly depleted across the state, concern is rising that we may be entering into a multiyear drought,” he said.
Still, it’s not the driest year on record in Idaho. That came in 1977, Hoekema said, which became known as “the year without snow.” Historically, Idaho’s drought years have followed winters with poor snowpack levels.
Irrigation-reliant farmers saw the reasonable snowpack levels in late March and planted accordingly, not expecting the dry, hot weather that followed.
“This year’s a really tough water year for farmers in Idaho,” said Sean Ellis, spokesman for the Idaho Farm Bureau Federation. “If they could’ve foreseen this … there would’ve been some farmers that would’ve switched from higher-water crops like sugar beets and potatoes into lower-water crops” like barley, wheat, hay and dry beans.
Thanks to the reservoirs, many farmers’ crops will survive the season, Ellis said, though many are reporting lower yields. Next year could be more troublesome.
“We finished last year’s irrigation season with carryover water that was above normal,” Ellis said. “This year, we’re not going to do that.”
Hoekema wrote in his report that it could take several years for some of the state’s reservoirs to recover. That means less water for everything from irrigating crops to providing water for fast-growing communities, and water officials around the state are strongly urging conservation.
SUEZ Water, which serves 240,000 people in Boise and the surrounding area, reported in late July that its customers’ water use was up 15%, using a billion gallons more than anticipated, largely for lawn-watering amid the heat. It urged water-saving measures, including limiting lawn-watering and not watering during the heat of the day."
other,"Under extant guidelines on Basel III Capital Regulations, exposures/claims of banks on rated as well as unrated Non-deposit Taking Systemically Important Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFC-ND-SIs), other than Asset Finance Companies (AFCs), Non-Banking Financial Companies _ Infrastructure Finance Companies (NBFCs-IFC) and Non-Banking Financial Companies _ Infrastructure Development Fund (NBFCs-IDF), have to be uniformly risk-weighted at 100%. With a view to facilitating flow of credit to well-rated NBFCs, it has now been decided that rated exposures of banks to all NBFCs, excluding Core Investment Companies (CICs), would be risk-weighted as per the ratings assigned by the accredited rating agencies, in a manner similar to that for corporates. Exposures to CICs will continue to be risk-weighted at 100%. Guidelines in this regard will be issued by the end of February 2019.Various categories of NBFCs have evolved over time pertaining to specific sector/asset classes. Regulations put in place for each NBFC category have also been somewhat different. At present, there are twelve such categories. The Committee on Comprehensive Financial Services for Small Businesses and Low Income Households (chaired by Dr. Nachiket Mor) and Internal Committee (Chairman: Shri G. Padmanabhan), which submitted their reports in January 2014 and April 2014 respectively, had recommended harmonisation of the various categories of NBFCs. The Reserve Bank is committed to such harmonisation and to move towards activity-based regulation replacing the current entity-based regulation for the NBFC sector. As a first step in this direction, deposit acceptance regulations were harmonised in November 2014. Further, with the recent rationalization and liberalization of ECB norms, differential rules applicable to various categories of NBFCs stand harmonised.It has now been decided to harmonise major categories of NBFCs engaged in credit intermediation, viz., Asset Finance Companies (AFC), Loan Companies, and Investment Companies, into a single category. The proposed merger of existing categories would reduce to a large extent the complexities arising from multiple categories and also provide the NBFCs greater flexibility in their operations. It will cover 99% of the NBFCs by number. Guidelines in this regard will be issued by the end of February 2019."
other,"It started with a two-and-a-half-mile run with his partner. Now it's a lifestyle for Robbie Balenger.
He's pushed his body and mind to the very limits by taking on mammoth endurance challenges, notably running 3,175 miles across the US in just 75 days in 2019 in order to promote the benefits of a plant-based diet.
More recently, Balenger broke the record for most laps around New York's Central Park in one day.
His life now is in sharp contrast to when he was running successful restaurants.
""I lived in Austin, Texas, and was very much a part of the food and bar scene. With that comes a lot of partying and late nights,"" he tells CNN.
""You work hard, then you blow off steam. I was still living that kind of lifestyle and quickly realized it wasn't going to add up.
""All that partying wasn't really going to make me a very good leader or someone that could fulfill the duties of my job every day in the way I wanted to.""
Then his now-fiancee invited him on a run. The short jog triggered something in Balenger, who quickly saw the advantages of exercising as a way of coping with the stresses of his job and coming up with new ideas for his restaurant.
Balenger gradually took on longer and tougher challenges; a half-marathon; a full marathon; and then found himself lining up on the start line for a grueling ultra-marathon.
""It definitely replaced that hard-partying lifestyle,"" he adds. ""[It was] much healthier but there was still something in there that felt kind of similar. It's kind of a raw feeling."""
other,"It¡¯s easy to see why, despite the data, predetermined formulas are attractive to monetary policymakers. The prevailing wisdom holds that in order to return the inflation rate to a preferred level, any slack in the economy must be eliminated. This requires pushing interest rates as low as possible, and when these policies have run their course (such as when rates dip toward the negative), unconventional instruments like ¡°quantitative easing¡± must be deployed to revive growth and inflation. The paradigm has become so universally accepted _ and the model simulations underpinning central banks¡¯ decisions have become so complex _ that few are willing to question it. For individual central banks or economists, to do so would be sacrilege.Central banks do not completely deny the economic costs that these policies imply: exuberance in financial markets, financing gaps in funded pension systems, and deeper wealth inequality, to name just a few. But these costs are deemed an acceptable price to pay to reach the clearly defined inflation level.Yet the policies pursued in recent years have given no room for the intangibles _ unstable political environments, geopolitical tremors, or rising risks on financial markets _ that can send models off course. As the 2008 financial crisis illustrated, the normal distribution of risk was useless for predictions.Keynes never tired of arguing that monetary policy becomes ineffective if uncertainty is sufficient to destabilize the expectations of consumers and investors. Unfortunately, many central banks have forgotten this. The Bank of Japan, the Bank of England, and the European Central Bank all hone to rather rigid policy rules. If expansionary policies fail to have the desired effect of lifting inflation to the predefined level of around 2%, they do not question their models; they simply increase the policy dosage _ which is just what markets expect."
drought,"As temperatures recently reached triple digits, farmer Joe Del Bosque inspected the almonds in his parched orchard in California’s agriculture-rich San Joaquin Valley, where a deepening drought threatens one of the state's most profitable crops.
Del Bosque doesn’t have enough water to properly irrigate his almond orchards, so he’s practicing “deficit irrigation” — providing less water than the trees need. He left a third of his farmland unplanted to save water for the nuts. And he may pull out 100 of his 600 acres (243 hectares) of almond trees after the late summer harvest — years earlier than planned.
“We may have to sacrifice one of them at the end of the year if we feel that we don’t have enough water next year,” said Del Bosque, who also grows melons, cherries and asparagus. “That means that our huge investment that we put in these trees is gone.”
A historic drought across the U.S. West is taking a heavy toll on California’s $6 billion almond industry, which produces roughly 80% of the world’s almonds. More growers are expected to abandon their orchards as water becomes scarce and expensive.
It’s a sharp reversal for the almond’s relentless expansion in California’s agricultural Central Valley, whose dry Mediterranean-like climate and reliable irrigation system made it the perfect location to grow the increasingly popular nut.
Almond orchards are thirsty permanent crops that need water year-round, clashing with a worsening drought and intensifying heat waves tied to climate change. Scientists say climate change has made the American West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will keep making weather more extreme.
California almond production grew from 370 million pounds (nearly 168 million kilograms) in 1995 to a record 3.1 billion pounds (1.4 billion kilograms) in 2020, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. During that period, land planted with almond trees grew from 756 square miles (1,958 square kilometers) to 2,500 square miles (6,475 square kilometers).
In May, the USDA projected that California's almond crop would hit a record 3.2 billion pounds (1.5 billion kilograms) this year, but in July, it scaled back that estimate to 2.8 billion pounds (1.3 billion kilograms), citing low water availability and record heat."

other,"The global pandemic threw daily routines out the window; sleep schedules changed, so did diets, workout regimens, even hygiene. Stress levels were reported higher than ever.
Fitbit CEO James Park said the last 18 months inspired the company to look closer at how its fitness trackers can better support mental health and stress management. Its solution: a next-generation fitness tracker that scores how mentally and physically ready users are to take on challenges each morning — and makes personalized suggestions to better plan their day.
""We realized [during the pandemic] we were capable of more than we thought and what it means to be strong took on a new meaning -- maybe it isn't about being in the best shape physically,"" Park said in a press briefing. ""It's about checking in with your body and balancing activity with rest. It's about finding time for both your mental and physical health and managing your stress. It is about giving yourself a break today.""
The Charge 5 ($179.95) comes with all the bells and whistles you'd expect on a fitness tracker -- it's thin, sleek, features a bright AMOLED screen and touts built-in GPS. But its new daily readiness feature is the big selling point. Fitbit (FIT) said it uses an algorithm to generate a score each morning that looks at the level of activity or exertion from the previous day; how well you slept in the past few days; and heart rate variability during deep sleep, which helps measure the body's responses to stress factors such as illness and emotional stress.
These benchmarks are then measured against a personal baseline. When a user gets a low score, the app will suggest prioritizing recovery and recommend activities such as yoga, stretching or a mindfulness session. When a high score is given, it'll suggest one of its hundreds of workouts.
The feature is available via Fitbit's Premium service, which costs $10 a month (or $80 annually) for advanced health insights, sleep tools, games and guided programs. The Charge 5 comes with six free months of the service."

other,"Corporate bond yields hardened during H2:2017- 18 tracking the rising G-sec yields (Chart IV.13a). In contrast, credit spread, i.e., the spreads of corporate bond yields over G-sec yields of corresponding maturity narrowed from September 2017 onwards, barring intermittent spikes during December and January. The spreads of 5-year AA rated corporate bonds yields declined by 16 basis points, reflecting improvement in financing conditions on the back of higher corporate earnings in a brightening macroeconomic outlook, and with the prospects of speedy resolution of insolvency under the bankruptcy code. Empirical analysis suggests that credit spreads increase with amplification of credit risks as captured through credit default swap (CDS) spreads, and increase in global liquidity risks measured by the Libor-OIS spread. However, spreads reduce with an increase in earnings prospects as reflected in 12-month forward price-to-earning-ratios4.

other,"The intellectual underpinning for the second approach is based on the insight that monetary policy has the potential to affect financial stability through several channels, one of the most important of which is the risk-taking channel. US Federal Reserve governor Jeremy C. Stein puts it succinctly: ¡°Monetary policy is fundamentally in the business of altering risk premiums.¡± Loose monetary policy can heighten vulnerabilities in the financial system by altering both the perception of risk and the tolerance for risk. In conventional monetary policy, lower policy rates boost incomes and profits and enhance asset and collateral values. This reduces the incidence of default in banks¡¯ asset portfolios, leading to greater leveraging and risk-taking. In unconventional monetary policy, large-scale asset purchases by central banks depress returns along the entire yield curve. This provides asset managers the incentive to take on more risk, often in a herdlike fashion.When interest rates are below the natural rate at which desired investment and savings reach equilibrium, banks will continue to expand credit. When economic agents are determined to take risks, they will find ways to circumvent measures that central banks and regulators have put in place. Nonmonetary tools such as macroprudential policy will therefore not adequately address the root problem caused by interest rates that are too low."

Typhoon,"A senior U.N. humanitarian official said Monday that nearly 10 million people in the Philippines have been affected by the massive typhoon that ravaged the country on Friday.
John Ging, operations director of the U.N.’s humanitarian office, told reporters that 9.8 million people have been affected and 660,000 displaced from what he said was the biggest typhoon recorded in nearly a century.
Ging said the devastation wa huge and the U.N. was mobilizing for a massive response.
“We, in the United Nations and with our international NGO partners, are very much in support and we are focused on - as you would expect -- first and foremost, on the requirements for food, the requirements for shelter support, the requirements for medical support, to prevent the outbreak of public health disasters with so many people - estimated now over 10,000 people perished,” he said.
Ging expressed hope that the death toll would not go higher, but said everyone must be prepared for the worst as responders reach remote areas.
He commended the Philippine authorities, who he said were responding in a “very impressive” way.
Ging said efforts to reach those in need were complicated by logistical constraints, including damage to infrastructure, roads and airports.
U.N. Humanitarian chief Valerie Amos is on her way to the Philippines where she will launch an appeal for funds on Tuesday. In the meantime, the U.N. has released $25 million from its Central Emergency Relief Fund to assist aid agencies in quickly mobilizing relief efforts.

Typhoon,"Typhoon Wipha, which is currently a storm with 110 mph winds located several hundred miles south of Kyoto, Japan, appears poised to sideswipe, or possibly even make a direct hit on Japan in the coming days. The storm is expected to bring strong winds, heavy rain, and high waves to the Japanese coast from Tokyo northward, including the ailing Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, where cleanup efforts have already hit serious roadblocks.
Current forecasts show Wipha making landfall, or coming close to making landfall, near Tokyo on Tuesday into Wednesday, while transitioning from a weakening tropical cyclone into a hybrid storm, with characteristics of both a tropical storm and an extratropical system. Those characteristics are similar to some of the features that Hurricane Sandy had when it devastated the U.S. East Coast nearly a year ago this month. Wipha could bring an expanded area of high winds and pounding surf along with several inches of rain to heavily populated areas of Japan, including the vulnerable nuclear plant that was incapacitated by the massive earthquake and tsunami in 2011. The tsunami led to a series of cascading engineering failures, culminating in a triple nuclear meltdown at the plant in the worst accident at a nuclear power plant since Chernobyl in 1986.
Ryan Maue, a meteorologist at WeatherBell Analytics, a private forecasting firm, told Climate Central that the storm poses a “huge flood potential” for the Fukushima area. “Deep convection on the westward flank of the storm . . . plus the topography of Japan means heavy rain for the coastline regardless of the Typhoon's track,” he said in an email message. “Wipha is extra-large size-wise,” Maue said, predicting it will grow and strengthen as it makes its closest pass to Japan, aided by strong jet stream winds in the upper atmosphere.
Even in the absence of landfalling typhoons, cleanup work at Fukushima has hit numerous serious roadblocks, with recent discoveries that the plant has been leaking radioactive water into the Pacific Ocean. A team of 16 experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency is currently in Japan to visit the plant and advise the Japanese government on how to deal with the challenge of storing large amounts of radioactive material on site."

After turning into surplus during March 2-15, the system moved into deficit again during March 16-22 mainly on account of quarterly advance tax outflows.

The weighted average call rate (WACR) inched closer to the policy repo rate from 12 basis points below the policy rate in January to 7 bps in February, and 5 bps in March.Merchandise export growth decelerated in January and February 2018, pulled down by a slowdown in exports of gems and jewellery, readymade garments and engineering goods. Import growth also moderated in February due to a decline in gold imports, lower growth in non-oil non-gold imports, and contraction in imports of transport equipment, vegetable oils and pulses. As import growth continued to exceed export growth in January-February, the trade deficit widened.

wildfires,"“Last year was the hottest year on record and was above average for the number of reported major droughts and heatwaves. This year we are seeing a similar pattern with new temperature records being set on a monthly basis,” UNISDR chief Robert Glasser said yesterday in a news release issued by the Office.
He noted that a number of risk factors, such as lack of forest management, growth of urban areas in proximity to forests and human induced fires need to be addressed by disaster management authorities.
“The most frightening scenario is when major towns are threatened as we have seen this week in the case of Funchal and Marseille,” the senior UN official added.
According to UNISDR, firefighters on the Portuguese island of Madeira continue to battle wildfires that have reached Funchal, the island’s largest city, killing three people and destroying over 150 homes. The Government has also sought help to deal with nearly 200 fires on the mainland.
Similarly, Around 2,000 firefighters have been battling 8,000 acres of wildfires in the French region of Provence. More than 10,000 people have been evacuated from the Rhone river delta area which has been affected by drought, and there had been concerns that one of the blazes was close to Marseille which houses a number of petrochemical plants.
The fires are now reportedly under control but a high state of alert is being maintained.
Meanwhile, wildfires continue to wreak havoc in Spain. Some seven per cent of the La Palma island, part of the country’s Canary Islands was “devoured” by a wildfire and wildfires have also spread across 9,120 acres of land in the northern Spanish region of Galicia, reported UNISDR.
Additionally, UNISDR said that the Soberanes fire in northern California, near the Big Sur region, is now 50 per cent contained after growing to more than 67,000 acres. Some 4,800 firefighters have been deployed but 57 homes have been destroyed.
The wildfire in the United States was caused by an illegal unattended campfire, added the press release.
UNISDR also said that according to its Global Assessment Report, published in 2013, wildfires have a devastating impact on natural capital that has not be adequately accounted for, noting “Fires affect numerous ecosystem services including carbon storage, support to biodiversity, protection of water sources, reduction of soil erosion and land degradation and climate regulation.”
It stated that such fires may be leading to a loss of ecosystem services in the range of $146 to $191 billion per year."
other,"Monetary policy also belongs to the Fed¡¯s tools. The term monetary policydenotes the activities undertaken by the Fed to achieve control over the US monetary supply inside the country. The Fed can take decisions depending on the economy state, to adopt an expansionary policy or a contractionary policy, whereby money supply is influenced via two methods.In periods of economic slowdown, it is the Fed frequent choice to consider adopting an expansionary policy. To begin with, the monetary base is expanded and interest rates are decreased. The essence of the expansionary policy is that money is more widely available to both banks and businesses, so that growth and development can be boosted. The results targeted are increase in the GDP and shrinking of the unemployment rate.Sometimes, following a period of rapid economic expansion the economy heats up. Before that happens or in the worst case scenario when this happens, the Fed proceeds to the adoption of a contractionary policy. In doing that, the central bank shrinks the monetary base and hikes the main interest rates. As a result, excess capital becomes scarcer, and a higher premium is imposed on lending. Owing to the smaller scale circulation of capital, the economy is bound to commence a slowdown. During the period of contraction the GDP is expected to decrease and the unemployment rate to rise.

Post-landfall update towards the foot of this article. Hanna was a tropical storm on Friday and while it was expected to strengthen it was only given a low probability of reaching hurricane status. But hurricane Hanna defied some of the forecast models, to become the first hurricane of the 2020 Atlantic season on Saturday and intensify further as it moved towards the Texas coastline. Insurance, reinsurance and ILS market interests may have had a closer eye on tropical storm Gonzalo as yesterday forecasts suggested it could make it through the Caribbean, but now that storm is dissipating and hurricane Hanna has become the one to watch. Hurricane Hanna achieved sustained winds of 90mph with higher gusts to 110mph or more, as it moved slowly towards a landfall in Texas somewhere on the central Padre Island seashore. Hurricane Hanna could have strengthened further and the storms intensity was only limited by the amount of time it had over the warm Gulf waters. The modelled intensity forecast from TropicalTidbits.com showed a continued spike in wind speeds was expected up until landfall. The Texas coastal islands are already experiencing storm surge from hurricane Hanna, while the forecast is for coastal inundation totals of 2 to 6 feet above normal sea levels widely around the landfall region. Corelogic said in an update on hurricane Hanna that more than 14,000 residential properties lie in surge exposed areas near the area of the storms expected landfall. Significant rainfall totals are expected with hurricane Hanna, with the potential for isolated totals of 18 inches or perhaps more and life-threatening flash flood warnings raised for the southern Texas coastal region. Adding to the challenges, hurricane Hanna is coming ashore in a region of Texas where Covid-19 cases have been spiking in recent weeks, raising issues around distancing at evacuation centers should they be needed."
earthquake,"A magnitude 5.9 earthquake off Indonesia's Java island on Saturday killed one person and damaged buildings in several cities, media reports said.
The quake was felt in cities and towns across East Java, home to 40.7 million people, and nearby provinces, including the resort island of Bali, Indonesian media reported.
One person died in Lumajang after being hit by a falling boulder, news website Detik.com said, citing a town disaster official.
There had been aftershocks but there was no risk of tsunami, Indonesian geophysics agency BMKG said.
Reports of damage included parliamentary buildings, a school, a hospital and houses in several cities, while a large gorilla statue in an amusement park in the town of Batu lost its head.
The national disaster agency said authorities were still taking stock of the damage.
The quake struck in the Indian Ocean 91 km (57 miles) off the southern coast of East Java. It had a magnitude of 5.9 at a depth of 96 km, the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre said, after initially saying the magnitude was 6.8.
Video shared by social media users showed people running out of a shopping mall in Malang city amid the strong tremor.
""I felt the earthquake twice, the first time for two seconds and then it stopped, but then it shook again for five seconds,"" Edo Afizal, a receptionist at a hotel in Blitar, told Reuters by phone.
Indonesia was struck last week by tropical cyclone Seroja, which triggered landslides and flash floods killing more than 160 people on islands in East Nusa Tenggara province.
Straddling the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, Indonesia is regularly hit by earthquakes. A magnitude 6.2 quake that struck Sulawesi island in January killed more than 100 people."
valcano eruption,"Japan volcano: 16 still missing after Mount Ontake eruption Sixteen people are still missing following the deadly eruption of Mount Ontake last weekend, Japanese officials have said. The search has been temporarily called off as a typhoon near the southwest coast made conditions hazardous. The volcano, about 200km (125 miles) west of Tokyo, erupted last Saturday killing 47 people, mostly hikers. It is still emitting poisonous fumes. More than 1,000 people been searching for survivors. Mount Ontake's eruption, the worst volcanic disaster in Japan for 90 years, spewed grey ash and stones that blanketed the entire area. Rescue workers say the ash has been as thick as half a metre in some parts. Some of the dead have been found half-buried in the ash, while others were hit by rocks thrown out by the crater. Dozens of hikers were present on the mountain and were caught by surprise by its eruption."
flood,"Australia to evacuate thousands as Sydney faces worst floods in 60 years SYDNEY: Australian authorities are planning to evacuate thousands more people on Monday (Mar 22) from flood-affected suburbs in Sydney's west, which is set for its worst flooding in 60 years with drenching rain expected to continue for the next few days.  Unrelenting rains over the past three days swelled rivers in Australia's most populous state of New South Wales (NSW), causing widespread damage and triggering calls for mass evacuations."
other,"From late 2015 through the end of 2018, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) gradually increased its target range for the federal funds rate as the economy continued to make progress toward the Committee's congressionally mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability. In its meetings over the first half of 2019, the Committee judged that the stance of monetary policy was appropriate to achieve its dual mandate, and it decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent (figure 45). These decisions reflected incoming information showing the solid fundamentals of the U.S. economy supporting continued growth and strong employment."
other,"Conditions in the global economy have generally continued to improve. Forecasts for growth have been revised up again recently, with global GDP now expected to grow at trend pace, or a little above, in 2010. While the recovery is most advanced in Asia and in some other emerging economies, there are also signs that the pick-up in North America has become more broad based recently. The main area of weakness continues to be Europe, with concerns about the fiscal situation in a number of countries, particularly Greece, increasing significantly over the past month.With the recovery at different stages in different parts of the world, the nature of the challenges varies across regions. In the advanced economies, the recovery is still dependent on accommodative fiscal and monetary policies and there are very high levels of excess capacity that will remain for some time. Credit conditions also remain tight and core inflation is still trending lower. While in most countries the data over the past six months have been better than was expected a year ago, significant fiscal challenges lie ahead that are weighing on medium-term growth prospects."

earthquake,"7.5-magnitude quake hits near Russia's Kuril Islands MOSCOW: A 7.5-magnitude quake hit off Russia's Kuril Islands on Wednesday (Mar 25), the US Geological Survey said, although there was no tsunami threat as previously reported. The quake hit at a depth of 59km, around 1,400km northeast of the Japanese city of Sapporo, USGS added. There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said soon after the quake that a tsunami watch was issued for the state of Hawaii, while another agency, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, said the quake had potential to generate a destructive tsunami. ""Tsunami waves are forecast to be less than 0.3 meters above the tide level,"" the center said in its advisory about risks to the coasts of Hawaii, Japan, Russia and the Pacific islands of Midway, the Northern Marianas and Wake Island. In an update about an hour later, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center cancelled the tsunami warning, saying that ""only very small tsunami waves were generated by this earthquake and there is no further threat"". The four southernmost islands of the Kuril chain - Habomai, Shikotan, Etorofu and Kunashiri - have been disputed between Moscow and Tokyo since the end of World War II. The Kurils are known as the Northern Territories in Japan."
other,"Since the MPC¡¯s meeting in April, the global economic recovery has been gaining momentum, driven mainly by major advanced economies (AEs) and powered by massive vaccination programmes and stimulus packages. Activity remains uneven in major emerging market economies (EMEs), with downside risks from renewed waves of infections due to contagious mutants of the virus and the relatively slow progress in vaccination. World merchandise trade continues to recover as external demand resumes, though elevated freight rates and container dislocations are emerging as constraints. CPI inflation is firming up in most AEs, driven by release of pent-up demand, elevated input prices and unfavourable base effects. Inflation in major EMEs has been generally close to or above official targets in recent months, pushed up by the sustained rise in global food and commodity prices. Global financial conditions remain benign."
wildfires,"One of the most devastating wildfire outbreaks in Texas history left more than 1,000 homes in ruins Tuesday and stretched the state's firefighting ranks to the limit, confronting Gov. Rick Perry with a major disaster at home just as the GOP presidential contest heats up. More than 180 fires have erupted in the past week across the rain-starved Lone Star State, and nearly 600 of the homes destroyed since then were lost in one catastrophic blaze in and around Bastrop, near Austin, that raged out of control Tuesday for a third day.
Whipped into an inferno by Tropical Storm Lee's winds over the weekend, the blaze burned more than 45 square miles, forced the evacuation of thousands and killed at least two people, bringing the overall death toll from the outbreak to at least four. ""We lost everything,"" said Willie Clements, whose two-story colonial home in a housing development near Bastrop was reduced to a heap of metal roofing and ash. A picket fence was melted. Some goats and turkeys survived, but about 20 chickens and ducks were burned to death in a coop that went up in flames. On Tuesday, Clements and his family took a picture of themselves in front of a windmill adorned with a charred red, white and blue sign that proclaimed, ""United We Stand."" ""This is the beginning of our new family album,"" the 51-year-old Clements said. Perry cut short a presidential campaign trip to South Carolina to deal with the crisis. On Tuesday, he toured a blackened area near Bastrop, about 25 miles from Austin, and later deployed the state's elite search team to the area to look for more possible victims. Texas Task Force 1 is the same outfit sent to New York following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and to New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. ""Pretty powerful visuals of individuals who lost everything,"" Perry said after the tour. ""The magnitude of these losses are pretty stunning."" The governor would not say whether he would take part in Wednesday evening's Republican presidential debate in California, explaining that he was ""substantially more concerned about making sure Texans are being taken care of."""
valcano eruption,"In pictures: Taal erupts and coats Philippines towns in ash Taal volcano in the Philippines started to erupt on Sunday. Rumbling sounds and tremors were followed by a huge plume of ash being released into the sky. Towns around Taal - which is about 70km (45 miles) south of the capital Manila - were coated in thick ash and sludge, and in the early hours of Monday morning the volcano began to spew lava. Taal is the Philippines' second most active volcano. It is also one of the world's smallest volcanoes, and has recorded at least 34 eruptions in the past 450 years. Lightning was seen striking around the volcano's ash clouds as it erupted."
drought,"With skies hazed by wildfires, lawns so crisp they look flammable and the St. Johns River stagnant in places, Central Florida's drought is one for the ages, measuring by rain gauges as the most pitiless in a century.
From the start of the year through Wednesday, Orlando has had 3.18 inches of rainfall, according to the National Weather Service. That's how much was recorded for the same period in 1907. The driest start on record, through May 10, was 2.64 inches in 1898.
Orlando did not get rain last month and has not had significant rain since mid-February.
The next decent chance, this weekend, ""doesn't look all that good,"" said the weather service's Derrick Weitlich.
To a degree, the city's gauge at Orlando International Airport has been unlucky, forecasters say, because surrounding cities have had a few or several inches more rain this year.
Still, a large part of Central and South Florida has been scorched; authorities are urging residents to ease up on lawn watering.
The weekly update Thursday of the U.S. Drought Monitor, a collaboration of government and academic experts, showed the state coverage of extreme drought expanding during the past week from 3,600 square miles to 5,400 square miles.
That footprint of extreme drought – the second most severe category behind exceptional drought – spread north through Osceola County into south Orange."
wildfires,"The brush fire is under control, but a crew stayed on scene well into the night, just to make sure it stays down.
As the sun went down on Pittsburg, firefighters gained control of what they called an unusual fire.
""It's burning on top of the water. Fire on water,"" said George Laing from the Contra Costa Fire Protection District.
Flaming tule reeds, eight to 10 feet high, burned over a boggy marsh filled with three to four feet of water. Firefighters relied on catwalks to get to the flames, but when the catwalks caught fire they had to slog through the marsh.
The Pittsburg power plant is currently non-operational. So there was no threat of a major power outage. The real threat came from transmission lines above.
""The PG&E transmission lines contain high voltage and in some cases smoke and particulate matter burning from fires can cause arcing between the lines and down to the ground, and that was a concern,"" said Laing.
Willow Pass Road was closed for about two hours preventing people from getting to work and home.
""Last summer we had the other side of the road catch on fire and we had pretty much the same situation and we were stuck out here. It was around the Fourth of July,"" said Steve Sebastian, a truck driver.
But that was July when vegetation is expected to be dry.
""We're all surprised at aggressive fire behavior that causes a three-alarm fire in the tules in March. We're concerned about the kind of fire behavior we're going to get this summer,"" said Laing.
This fire consumed a lot of fresh green grass and by July it'll all be dead, so another fire like this could spread a lot faster and jump the roads. Investigators are still trying to figure out the cause of this fire.
Capt. Robert Marshall said the blaze threatened a few power lines connected to the nearby NRG Energy, Inc. natural gas power plant but was not a threat to any structures at the plant, including large tanks previously used for fuel storage.
No injuries were reported."
other,"I will now turn to monetary policy. The FOMC is committed to policies that promote maximum employment and price stability, consistent with our dual mandate from the Congress. Given the economic situation that I just described, we judge that a high degree of monetary policy accommodation remains appropriate. Consistent with that assessment, we have maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and have continued to rely on large-scale asset purchases and forward guidance about the future path of the federal funds rate to provide the appropriate level of support for the economy.In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment that has occurred since the inception of the Federal Reserve's asset purchase program in September 2012 and the FOMC's assessment that labor market conditions would continue to improve, the Committee has made measured reductions in the monthly pace of our asset purchases at each of our regular meetings this year. If incoming data continue to support our expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward 2 percent, the Committee likely will make further measured reductions in the pace of asset purchases at upcoming meetings, with purchases concluding after the October meeting. Even after the Committee ends these purchases, the Federal Reserve's sizable holdings of longer-term securities will help maintain accommodative financial conditions, thus supporting further progress in returning employment and inflation to mandate-consistent levels.The Committee is also fostering accommodative financial conditions through forward guidance that provides greater clarity about our policy outlook and expectations for the future path of the federal funds rate. Since March, our postmeeting statements have included a description of the framework that is guiding our monetary policy decisions. Specifically, our decisions are and will be based on an assessment of the progress--both realized and expected--toward our objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. Our evaluation will not hinge on one or two factors, but rather will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation and long-term inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.Based on its assessment of these factors, in June the Committee reiterated its expectation that the current target range for the federal funds rate likely will be appropriate for a considerable period after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal and provided that inflation expectations remain well anchored. In addition, we currently anticipate that even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the federal funds rate below levels that the Committee views as normal in the longer run.Of course, the outlook for the economy and financial markets is never certain, and now is no exception. Therefore, the Committee's decisions about the path of the federal funds rate remain dependent on our assessment of incoming information and the implications for the economic outlook. If the labor market continues to improve more quickly than anticipated by the Committee, resulting in faster convergence toward our dual objectives, then increases in the federal funds rate target likely would occur sooner and be more rapid than currently envisioned. Conversely, if economic performance is disappointing, then the future path of interest rates likely would be more accommodative than currently anticipated."
other,"On the domestic front, the real gross value added (GVA) growth as per the first advance estimates (FAE) released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) is estimated to decelerate to 6.1 per cent in 2017-18 from 7.1 per cent in 2016-17 due mainly to slowdown in agriculture and allied activities, mining and quarrying, manufacturing, and public administration and defence (PADO) services.Information available after the release of FAE by the CSO has, however, been generally positive. Manufacturing output boosted the growth of index of industrial production (IIP) in November. After a period of prolonged weakness, cement production registered robust growth in November-December, which along with continuing healthy growth in steel production led to acceleration of infrastructure goods production in November. The manufacturing purchasing managers¡¯ index (PMI) expanded for the sixth consecutive month in January led by new orders. Assessment of overall business sentiment in the Indian manufacturing sector improved in Q3 as reflected in the Reserve Bank¡¯s Industrial Outlook Survey (IOS). However, core sector growth decelerated in December due to contraction/deceleration in production of coal, crude oil, steel and electricity. Acreage in the case of wheat, oilseeds and coarse cereals was lower than last year. As a result, the shortfall in area sown for rabi crops increased to (-)1.5 per cent as on February 2 as compared with (-)1.0 per cent on December 29, 2017."
other,"Against the backdrop of a weakening external economic environment and continuing stresses in global financial markets, the growth of the Singapore economy is expected to remain below potential in the period ahead.  Concomitantly, external and domestic inflationary pressures are likely to ease.MAS is therefore shifting its policy stance to a zero percent appreciation of the S$NEER policy band.  This policy maintains the current level of the policy band, and there will be no re-centring of the band or change to its width.  MAS stands ready to intervene to dampen excessive volatility in the S$NEER should this become necessary.  MAS will also continue to closely monitor developments in the external environment and their impact on the Singapore economy."
valcano eruption,"What caused the volcanic eruption on New Zealand's White Island and why was there no warning? Monitoring for hydrothermal eruptions is a huge challenge as the eruption is caused by steam, not magma, which is harder to track Five people have been confirmed dead, 31 remain in hospital with injuries and eight are still missing after sudden volcanic eruptions on Whakaari/White Island off the east coast of New Zealand. The island is a tourist destination and 47 people were on it when it erupted on Monday afternoon. Three of those rescued have now been discharged from hospital. Volcanologists at GeoNet, which operates a geological hazard monitoring system, described the eruption as impulsive and short-lived, with an ash plume that rose to more than 3km above the vent. On Tuesday morning the New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern praised the courage of the first responders and pilots who conducted an aerial survey. She confirmed that the flyovers have shown no signs of life. Police were assessing whether it was safe to return to the island for a recovery operation."
wildfires,"A Washington man’s cement home is still standing after surviving a raging wildfire that passed his home and scorched acres of surrounding land.
John Belles said he was prepared for the inevitability of a wildfire when he built his thin-shelled, concrete dome in 1999 surrounded by dry fields in Okanogan County.
Earlier this week, Belles just happened to be working 30 miles out of town when he received a voicemail from a friend warning him about a fire approaching his home, he told ABC News today.
After shuttling three vehicles off his property, Belles said he realized he had to hurry as the fire was only a couple hundred yards away.
“The fire was getting close, in fact, there was a firefighter there at the time who got trapped inside when I shut the gate inadvertently,” Belles said.
“I grabbed the hose, soaked my clothing down and doused the north side of the building as much as I could. [The fire] got close enough that it was super heated and getting uncomfortable out there in the smoke. I went inside, shut the door behind me and watched it move by.”
Belles said he waited out the flames for about a minute as the fire passed by his home."
flood,"Louisiana flood victims could get federal aid — but only if people report damage With storms dropping a massive amount of rainfall on parts of East Baton Rouge earlier this week, residents without flood insurance who unexpectedly found water in their home may be wondering when — or if — help will arrive in the form of federal dollars.  For federal money to become available to residents, a federal disaster must be declared by President Joe Biden. That action frees up aid and would make residents who are underinsured or uninsured eligible to apply for FEMA grants."
Typhoon,"Thousands of Texans remain without power in the aftermath of Hurricane Hanna Sign up for The Brief, our daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news. Two days after Hurricane Hanna touched down in South Texas, thousands remained without power and communities were grappling with how to deal with the damage caused by flooding and strong winds. The storm, which made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane Saturday evening at Padre Island, packed sustained winds as high as 90 mph before weakening into a tropical storm early Sunday and moving into northern Mexico. It was the first hurricane of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season. Hanna unleashed more than 15 inches of rain in parts of South Texas, resulting in serious flash flooding, according to The Washington Post. Gov. Greg Abbott warned Texans on Sunday that there are continued threats of flash flooding even as rainfall slows, due to overflowing rivers. ""Any additional rainfall will exacerbate these threats, but the State of Texas is ready to respond and protect our fellow Texans,"" he said in a statement. The Federal Emergency Management Agency and President Donald Trump approved a federal emergency declaration in response to Hanna, allowing for some federal assistance and reimbursement for evacuation efforts and shelter support. Abbott previously issued a disaster declaration for 32 counties. Downed power lines and trees have caused road closures across South Texas. As of 1 p.m. Monday, American Electric Power Texas, one of the state's largest electric providers, reported more than 58,000 power outages in Corpus Christi, Laredo and the Rio Grande Valley. Before Hanna made landfall, Corpus Christi Mayor Joe McComb told The Associated Press that the city was prepared to deal with both the pandemic and the hurricane. ""Don't feel like since we've been fighting COVID for five months that we're out of energy or we're out of gas,” he said. “We're not. We can do these two things together and we're going to win both of them."""
other,"Monetary policy refers to central bank activities that are directed toward influencing the quantity of money and credit in an economy. By contrast, fiscal policy refers to the government¡¯s decisions about taxation and spending. Both monetary and fiscal policies are used to regulate economic activity over time. They can be used to accelerate growth when an economy starts to slow or to moderate growth and activity when an economy starts to overheat. In addition, fiscal policy can be used to redistribute income and wealth.The overarching goal of both monetary and fiscal policy is normally the creation of an economic environment where growth is stable and positive and inflation is stable and low. Crucially, the aim is therefore to steer the underlying economy so that it does not experience economic booms that may be followed by extended periods of low or negative growth and high levels of unemployment. In such a stable economic environment, householders can feel secure in their consumption and saving decisions, while corporations can concentrate on their investment decisions, on making their regular coupon payments to their bond holders and on making profits for their shareholders."
other,"In 1998, the U.S. economy again performed impressively. Output expanded rapidly, the unemployment rate fell to the lowest level since 1970, and inflation remained subdued. Transitory factors, most recently falling prices for imports and commodities, especially oil, have helped to produce the favorable outcomes of recent years, but technological advances and increased efficiency, likely reflecting in part heightened global competition and changes in business practices, suggest that some of the improvement will be more lasting."
other,"Turning to monetary policy, the FOMC conducts policy to promote maximum employment and price stability, as required by our statutory mandate from the Congress. Last March, the Committee stated that it would be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it had seen further improvement in the labor market and was reasonably confident that inflation would move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term. In December, the Committee judged that these two criteria had been satisfied and decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 1/4 percentage point, to between 1/4 and 1/2 percent. This increase marked the end of a seven-year period during which the federal funds rate was held near zero. The Committee did not adjust the target range in January.The decision in December to raise the federal funds rate reflected the Committee's assessment that, even after a modest reduction in policy accommodation, economic activity would continue to expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators would continue to strengthen. Although inflation was running below the Committee's longer-run objective, the FOMC judged that much of the softness in inflation was attributable to transitory factors that are likely to abate over time, and that diminishing slack in labor and product markets would help move inflation toward 2 percent. In addition, the Committee recognized that it takes time for monetary policy actions to affect economic conditions. If the FOMC delayed the start of policy normalization for too long, it might have to tighten policy relatively abruptly in the future to keep the economy from overheating and inflation from significantly overshooting its objective. Such an abrupt tightening could increase the risk of pushing the economy into recession.It is important to note that even after this increase, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative. The FOMC anticipates that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate. In addition, the Committee expects that the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below the levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. This expectation is consistent with the view that the neutral nominal federal funds rate--defined as the value of the federal funds rate that would be neither expansionary nor contractionary if the economy was operating near potential--is currently low by historical standards and is likely to rise only gradually over time. The low level of the neutral federal funds rate may be partially attributable to a range of persistent economic headwinds--such as limited access to credit for some borrowers, weak growth abroad, and a significant appreciation of the dollar--that have weighed on aggregate demand.Of course, monetary policy is by no means on a preset course. The actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on what incoming data tell us about the economic outlook, and we will regularly reassess what level of the federal funds rate is consistent with achieving and maintaining maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. In doing so, we will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. In particular, stronger growth or a more rapid increase in inflation than the Committee currently anticipates would suggest that the neutral federal funds rate was rising more quickly than expected, making it appropriate to raise the federal funds rate more quickly as well. Conversely, if the economy were to disappoint, a lower path of the federal funds rate would be appropriate. We are committed to our dual objectives, and we will adjust policy as appropriate to foster financial conditions consistent with the attainment of our objectives over time.Consistent with its previous communications, the Federal Reserve used interest on excess reserves (IOER) and overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) operations to move the federal funds rate into the new target range. The adjustment to the IOER rate has been particularly important in raising the federal funds rate and short-term interest rates more generally in an environment of abundant bank reserves. Meanwhile, overnight RRP operations complement the IOER rate by establishing a soft floor on money market interest rates. The IOER rate and the overnight RRP operations allowed the FOMC to control the federal funds rate effectively without having to first shrink its balance sheet by selling a large part of its holdings of longer-term securities. The Committee judged that removing monetary policy accommodation by the traditional approach of raising short-term interest rates is preferable to selling longer-term assets because such sales could be difficult to calibrate and could generate unexpected financial market reactions.The Committee is continuing its policy of reinvesting proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from agency debt and mortgage-backed securities. As highlighted in the December statement, the FOMC anticipates continuing this policy ""until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way."" Maintaining our sizable holdings of longer-term securities should help maintain accommodative financial conditions and reduce the risk that we might need to return the federal funds rate target to the effective lower bound in response to future adverse shocks."
wildfires,"More and more of Alaska’s boreal forests are burning each year, according to a study released last week. Researchers found that the acreage of forest burned in interior Alaska has climbed almost five-fold since 1943. That increase is likely influenced by a regional shift to a warmer, drier climate, as well as by human disturbances like encroaching development and fire suppression. Researchers found that that increase was most pronounced in the region’s most populated area, where firefighting efforts are most intense.
Thanks to its size and the remoteness of much of the state, Alaska has had to take a highly targeted approach to fighting wildfires. In the 1980s, the state established four zones of fire response, depending on whether the events happen near human settlement, whether there are valuable natural resources in the area and how likely the fire is to spread. The state’s population hubs, like Anchorage and Fairbanks, are designated as “critical” zones and receive the most protection — which often means fire suppression.
In a concerning twist, the study’s authors found the steepest increase in area burned has been in the highest tiers of protection. Fairbanks, the most populated area they looked at, was the most glaring example: on average, 12.4 percent more acreage burns there each year than the previous one.  
The reasons for that increase are likely complicated and include the region’s logging history. In Fairbanks, in particular, the landscape was basically denuded in the 1900s, thanks to the gold rush. Miners cut down the region’s forests to build homes and mining infrastructure and to burn to heat the frozen soil for digging. In the 100 years since, the forests have grown back and slowly gone through their natural succession, from the relatively fireproof willows and birches to the flammable black spruce."
Typhoon,"CloudSat overpassed Typhoon Utor in the West Pacific on August 11, 2013 at 0518 UTC, this storm contained estimated maximum strength winds of 115 knots (132 mph) and minimum pressure of 937mb.
The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA's Aqua satellite captured the infrared (IR) image taken a few minutes before the CloudSat overpass (the blue line A-> B on Figures 1, 2 and 3). CloudSat overpassed about 10km to the east of the center of the storm revealing the structure of the eye and eye wall. This is one a handful of cases where CloudSat has directly intersected the eye of a storm of this intensity and size. The strength of Utor's at this time is equivalent to category 4 strength hurricane.
This overpass reveals many unique features of a well defined and intense Typhoon (tropical cyclone) - outward sloping eye and eyewall, rainband areas, moats and areas of high reflectivity (greater than 30dBZ). Heavy precipitation is distinuguished by the attenuation of the radar (lack of signal) in the lowest 5 km's (up to almost 10 km's in the eyewall area) of the CloudSat swath. The CloudSat overpasses reveals large amounts of liquid and ice water spread throughout the storm and also distinguishes rainbands areas separated by moats (cloud free areas) beneath the cirrus canopy."
other,"The housing market is expected to continue to weigh on economic activity in coming quarters.  Homebuilders, still faced with abnormally high inventories of unsold homes, are likely to cut the pace of their building activity further, which will subtract from overall growth and reduce employment in residential construction and closely related industries.Consumer spending continued to increase at a solid pace through much of the second half of 2007, despite the problems in the housing market, but it appears to have slowed significantly toward the end of the year.  The jump in the price of imported energy, which eroded real incomes and wages, likely contributed to the slowdown in spending, as did the declines in household wealth associated with the weakness in house prices and equity prices.  Slowing job creation is yet another potential drag on household spending, as gains in payroll employment averaged little more than 40,000 per month during the three months ending in January, compared with an average increase of almost 100,000 per month over the previous three months.  However, the recently enacted fiscal stimulus package should provide some support for household spending during the second half of this year and into next year.The business sector has also displayed signs of being affected by the difficulties in the housing and credit markets.  Reflecting a downshift in the growth of final demand and tighter credit conditions for some firms, available indicators suggest that investment in equipment and software will be subdued during the first half of 2008.  Likewise, after growing robustly through much of 2007, nonresidential construction is likely to decelerate sharply in coming quarters as business activity slows and funding becomes harder to obtain, especially for more speculative projects.  On a more encouraging note, we see few signs of any serious imbalances in business inventories aside from the overhang of unsold homes.  And, as a whole, the nonfinancial business sector remains in good financial condition, with strong profits, liquid balance sheets, and corporate leverage near historical lows."
drought,"California’s historic five-year drought is officially over, washed away with the relentlessly drenching rains, floods and snowstorms of this winter.
But just as tougher building codes and better emergency planning follow major earthquakes, the brutally dry years from 2012 to 2016 are already leaving a legacy, experts say, changing the way Californians use water for generations to come.
“There’s no question that we’ll be better prepared for the next drought because of the lessons learned in this one,” said Felicia Marcus, chairwoman of the State Water Resources Control Board in Sacramento. “This was the wake-up call of the century.”
The drought’s legacy includes landmark new laws aimed at limiting farmers from over-pumping groundwater; homeowners removing thousands of suburban lawns; voters approving billions in funding for new reservoirs; and vast expanses of forests dying off across the Sierra Nevada.
“Every drought has a lasting impact,” said Jeff Mount, a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California Water Center in San Francisco. “That probably goes all the way back to the Depression.”
The era of massive dam building in California began after the 1929-34 drought. Urban water conservation started in earnest during the 1976-77 drought. And the state’s brutal 1987-92 drought prompted water departments in the Bay Area and Southern California to connect their networks of pipes together, to build huge groundwater storage banks and new local reservoirs, and to develop a statewide system of buying and selling water.
As a result of those changes, Californians were better prepared to handle the most recent drought, which saw the driest four-year period of any time back to 1895, when modern records began. Although some farm communities with limited groundwater suffered severely, California’s overall economy grew during the drought, up 10 percent to $2.2 trillion from 2012 to 2015.
“We lost a third of our water supply,” said Jay Lund, director of the Center for Watershed Sciences at UC-Davis. “And the impact to the agricultural economy was a 2-3 percent loss and the urban economy had almost no economic impact. To me that’s remarkable.”"
other,"In April 2012, MAS increased the slope of the S$NEER policy band slightly.  A narrower policy band was restored, with no change to the level at which the band was centred.  This policy stance was aimed at anchoring inflation expectations, ensuring medium-term price stability and keeping growth on a sustainable path.The S$NEER has appreciated towards the upper bound of the policy band over the last six months, reflecting positive risk sentiment arising from policy responses in the US and Europe.  Nonetheless, periodic surges in global financial market stress exerted bouts of downward pressure on the S$NEER.  With low interest rates prevailing worldwide, the domestic three-month interbank rate has remained at 0.38% since December 2011."
Typhoon,"Tropical Storm Bertha forms off the South Carolina coast A tropical storm warning has been issued for South Carolina’s coast and the storm was expected to bring heavy rainfall, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. Tropical Storm Bertha formed Wednesday morning off the coast of South Carolina, becoming the second named storm before the official start of this year's Atlantic hurricane season. A tropical storm warning has been issued for South Carolina's coast and the storm was expected to bring heavy rainfall, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. Bertha’s maximum sustained winds were near 45 mph (75 kph) but it was expected to weaken to a tropical depression after moving inland. The storm was centered about 30 miles (50 kilometers) east-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina, and was moving northwest near 9 mph (15 kph)."
other,"In October last year, MAS maintained the policy of a modest and gradual appreciation of the S$NEER policy band.  This policy stance, which has been in place since April 2004, was assessed to be appropriate for containing any rise in inflationary pressures amidst higher global inflation and domestic costs.      Over the past six months, the S$NEER appreciated from the lower half to the upper half of the policy band.  (Chart 1)  Downward pressures on the S$NEER in early Q4 last year amidst broad-based US$ strength were short-lived, as the S$NEER soon strengthened in the subsequent months.  This reflected the strong investor interest in Asian markets, on the back of optimistic economic prospects in the region.  The S$NEER was also supported by encouraging domestic economic data and the favourable outlook for the economy. 
The appreciation of the S$NEER, coupled with the rise in domestic interest rates, has led to a significant tightening in domestic liquidity conditions since late 2005.  Reflecting in part the catch-up to prior increases in US interest rates, the three-month domestic interbank rate rose from 2.38% at end-September 2005 to 3.44% as at end-March this year, pulling up mortgage and deposit rates as well.  This increase has taken place against the backdrop of the strengthening economy.  Real domestic three-month interbank rates, which turned positive in December 2004, have remained largely in line with its historical average."
Typhoon,"Hundreds of people have been rescued after Hurricane Sally _ which has since transformed into a tropical storm _ made landfall in Alabama and Florida on Wednesday morning.
The storm arrived as a Category 2 hurricane in Gulf Shores, Alabama, around 4.45am with 105mph winds and rain depths in the feet, not inches, flooding homes and streets _ as people were forced to evacuate from the southern coast.
Some areas have already been hit with 24 inches of rain, and a total of 35 inches could come in parts of Florida and Alabama, according to the National Weather Service. Why specific areas were getting hammered with high rains was due, in part, to how slowly the storm was moving. It was traveling at just 7mph up the coastal states.
First responders used boats and high water vehicles in parts of Florida and Alabama to rescue hundreds of trapped residents while Hurricane Sally transformed into a tropical storm, with winds decreasing to 70mph.
The rescues came after some of the areas hit the hardest were not issued mandatory evacuations. Residents were encouraged to voluntarily leave, but some people still stayed behind in their homes.
“At one point we were grabbing things to evacuate because the water was starting to get up to the second level and then by that point it was too late for us to go anywhere,"" Kirsten Colla, who lives in a townhouse on Escambia Bay in Pensacola, Florida, told weather.com."
wildfires,"Firefighters in New Mexico and Colorado are battling wildfires that have spread quickly in all directions, forcing hundreds of people to flee from their homes across both states.
In Colorado, at least 18 structures, including homes, have been destroyed, while one person is missing and feared dead, according to authorities. Flames have torched more than 30 square miles in two days.
""If you talk about worst-case scenario, this is our worst-case scenario,"" Larimer County Sheriff Justin Smith said.
Hundreds of residents have been evacuated. Authorities sent at least 2,575 evacuation notices to phone numbers but it wasn't clear how many residents had to leave, according to ABC News Station KMGH-TV in Denver. About 500 people had checked in at Red Cross shelters, according to The Associated Press.
Some residents said they didn't receive any notice and their only warning was hearing the fire coming toward their doorsteps.
""It was terrible. It sounded like a hurricane,"" said Sandra Mullen, according to KMGH. ""I think everything will be gone. My husband is 78 and I'm 75, so when you're that old, it's too hard to start over.""
Resident Joanne Hertz said, ""It looked like Armageddon. I have absolutely no clue if my house is still standing.""
Resources are spread thin in Larimer County as other western states need tankers, helicopters and ground crews to battle their own wildfires, sheriff's spokesman Nick Christensen told KMGH."
earthquake,"(CNN)New Zealand has downgraded its tsunami warning after a powerful earthquake struck the Kermadec Islands region early Friday, sparking fears of a tsunami.
The 8.1-magnitude quake was the third to strike the area on Friday morning local time, according to the New Zealand National Emergency Management Agency.
Residents in some areas received emergency alerts on their phones urging them to ""EVACUATE NOW,"" as tsunami sirens rang out. The emergency agency issued a temporary evacuation order for people near the coast, warning them, ""Do not stay at home"" as a ""damaging tsunami is possible.""
The Kermadec Islands are 500 to 620 miles northeast of New Zealand's North Island. The East Coast of the North Island from the Bay of Islands to Whangarei, from Matata to Tolaga Bay including Whakatane and Opotiki and Great Barrier Island are all included in the Pacific nation's tsunami warning."

In a press release, The Weather Channel states that nearly 400 wildland firefighters have died in the past 20 years. Neil Katz, vice-president of content at The Weather Company, says the organization wants to help bring awareness to the serious national problem of wildfires, and to help keep people safe."
earthquake,"A strong 7.3-magnitude earthquake struck off Japan's east coast late Saturday, rattling the region hit by the powerful 2011 quake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown just weeks before the disaster's 10th anniversary.
The quake produced powerful shaking along parts of Japan's eastern coast, and was felt strongly in Tokyo, but triggered no tsunami alert.
Kyodo news agency reported at least 30 people injured, but gave no further details.
There were no immediate reports of significant damage, though local news broadcast images of a landslide on a highway.
Japan's meteorological agency said the quake hit at 11:08 pm (1408 GMT) at a depth of 60 kilometres (37 miles) in the Pacific off Fukushima -- near the epicentre of the 2011 killer quake which triggered a towering tsunami and killed more than 18,000 people.
The agency initially reported the strength of the quake as 7.1, but later revised the figure upwards. It said the quake was considered an aftershock of the massive 2011 temblor.
Aftershocks continued to rattle the region in the hours afterwards and officials cautioned local residents to be vigilant. A handful of people were reported to have sought shelter at evacuation centres.
""We are working quickly to collect information but we still have no details to announce. There were some unconfirmed reports about landslides but we are still checking,"" Mikihiro Meguro, an official from the Fukushima prefectural government, told AFP.
Around 950,000 homes lost power throughout the affected region, but no abnormalities were reported at the Fukushima nuclear plant, which melted down in the wake of the 2011 tsunami.
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga was called to his office, and broadcaster NHK said the government would set up a special liaison office to coordinate with affected regions.
""All messed up""
Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato addressed reporters after midnight and said evaluations were under way.
""As far as damage, casualties and structural damage are being assessed,"" he said, adding that sections of the bullet train had been suspended due to power outages.
""Surveys are being done at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant,"" he said.
""We have received reports that Onagawa nuclear plant and Fukushima Daichi nuclear plant are not showing any abnormality,"" he added.
Images posted online showed broken glass at a shop and items spilled off the shelves at a supermarket.
Renowned author Yu Miri, who lives in Fukushima's Minamisoma city, tweeted a photo of her home, showing books, potted plants and other belongings strewn across the floor.
""My house in Odaka, Minamisoma city is all messed up,"" she wrote.
""I hear the ground rumbling. And another quake,"" she tweeted about an aftershock.
Aerial footage broadcast by NHK showed a hillside that collapsed onto a highway in Fukushima region, severing the road. It was not immediately clear if anyone was hurt.
The US Geological Survey registered the quake at a revised magnitude of 7.1 with a depth of 51 kilometers.

Typhoon,"Eight months after Hurricane Laura devastated southwest Louisiana, the state transportation department has finished removing storm debris from state roadways.
The Department of Transportation and Development said it wrapped up removal of 1.4 million cubic yards of debris Tuesday in Calcasieu Parish, one of the hardest hit areas from Laura in August and the follow-up blow of Hurricane Delta in October.
The cleanup of debris from the 2020 storms on state roadways in other parishes already had been completed.
The transportation department said contractors statewide removed 3.3 million cubic yards of hurricane debris. Two-thirds of that was cleaned up in the southwestern Louisiana parishes of Allen, Beauregard, Calcasieu, Cameron and Jefferson Davis."
drought,"California is officially free of drought after more than seven years, drought monitors said Thursday.
The Golden State has experienced some form of drought for 376 consecutive weeks, the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska, tweeted. It’s the first time the state has been free of drought since Dec. 20, 2011.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration tweeted that weather in 2017 helped matters, but moderate drought persisted. Rainfall this winter further alleviated the drought, although 7 percent of the state remains ""abnormally dry.""
""The storms this year have really helped snowpacks, the reservoirs,"" said Jessica Blunden, a climatologist with NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information. Colder temperatures also helped prevent snow from melting off, she said.
This winter — the meteorological winter starts on Dec. 1 and ends at the end of February — has been the wettest in the United States as a whole since records started being kept in 1895, with an average across the nation of 9.01 inches, which is 2.22 inches above the nationwide average, Blunden said.
That precipitation has not just benefited California. ""It’s been a great winter for the West,"" she said.
The U.S. Drought Monitor website, which is an effort by several agencies including NOAA and the national drought mitigation center, says that well-above precipitation in the West helped build snow pack and fill reservoirs, and that normal conditions have returned to the Salton Sea in the southeastern part of the state.
The Los Angeles area experienced cool winter temperatures that brought the fifth-longest streak of 41 consecutive days with a high temperature below 70 degrees since records began in 1877. Rare snowfall was reported in parts of the Los Angeles area in February."
other,"WASHINGTON (AP) ¡ª The Federal Reserve says that its low interest rate policies are providing ¡°powerful support¡± for the economy as it recovers from the coronavirus pandemic.In its twice-a-year report to Congress on monetary policy released Friday, the Fed indicated that it plans to maintain that support until further progress is made in recovering from last year¡¯s severe recession.Progress on vaccinations helped to reopen the economy and produced strong economic growth over the first half of this year, the Fed noted. But the lingering effects of the pandemic still weigh on the economy, with employment well below pre-pandemic levels.
The central bank has kept its benchmark interest rate near zero, while continuing to buy $120 billion a month in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities to put downward pressure on long-term interest rates. It said Friday that these efforts will help ensure that ¡°monetary policy continues to deliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete.¡±The new report will be the subject of two days of hearings next week. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will testify Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee, and Thursday before the Senate Banking Committee."
other,"The Committee also stated that in determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, it will take appropriate account of their likely efficacy and costs. In other words, as with all of its policy decisions, the Committee continues to assess its program of asset purchases within a cost-benefit framework. In the current economic environment, the benefits of asset purchases, and of policy accommodation more generally, are clear: Monetary policy is providing important support to the recovery while keeping inflation close to the FOMC's 2 percent objective. Notably, keeping longer-term interest rates low has helped spark recovery in the housing market and led to increased sales and production of automobiles and other durable goods. By raising employment and household wealth--for example, through higher home prices__these developments have in turn supported consumer sentiment and spending.Highly accommodative monetary policy also has several potential costs and risks, which the Committee is monitoring closely. For example, if further expansion of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet were to undermine public confidence in our ability to exit smoothly from our accommodative policies at the appropriate time, inflation expectations could rise, putting the FOMC's price-stability objective at risk. However, the Committee remains confident that it has the tools necessary to tighten monetary policy when the time comes to do so. As I noted, inflation is currently subdued, and inflation expectations appear well anchored; neither the FOMC nor private forecasters are projecting the development of significant inflation pressures.Another potential cost that the Committee takes very seriously is the possibility that very low interest rates, if maintained for a considerable time, could impair financial stability. For example, portfolio managers dissatisfied with low returns may ""reach for yield"" by taking on more credit risk, duration risk, or leverage. On the other hand, some risk-taking--such as when an entrepreneur takes out a loan to start a new business or an existing firm expands capacity--is a necessary element of a healthy economic recovery. Moreover, although accommodative monetary policies may increase certain types of risk-taking, in the present circumstances they also serve in some ways to reduce risk in the system, most importantly by strengthening the overall economy, but also by encouraging firms to rely more on longer-term funding, and by reducing debt service costs for households and businesses. In any case, the Federal Reserve is responding actively to financial stability concerns through substantially expanded monitoring of emerging risks in the financial system, an approach to the supervision of financial firms that takes a more systemic perspective, and the ongoing implementation of reforms to make the financial system more transparent and resilient. Although a long period of low rates could encourage excessive risk-taking, and continued close attention to such developments is certainly warranted, to this point we do not see the potential costs of the increased risk-taking in some financial markets as outweighing the benefits of promoting a stronger economic recovery and more-rapid job creation.5"
other,"A monetary policy is generally the process through which a central bank with a sole right to issue its own currency (legal tender or monetary base) maintains the value of that currency, that is, price, and achieves sustainable economic growth by managing the amount of money (monetary base and money created in the banking system) in circulation, and price (interest rate) in the economy.Money is a unit of account for the prices of goods, services, and financial and real assets. And it can be a medium of exchange and carry out a storage of value function.Article 1, Clause 1 of the¡¸Bank of Korea Act¡¹ stipulates that the purpose of this Act is ¡°to contribute to the sound development of the national economy by pursuing price stability through the formulation and implementation of efficient monetary policy¡±. Accordingly, the Bank of Korea takes price stability as the most important objective of its monetary policy. If prices become unstable, uncertainty concerning the future mounts, discouraging economic activities as a whole, and the distribution of income and resources grows distorted. As a result, the stabilityin economic conditions as a whole is damaged.In order for the national economy to achieve stable growth, it should be supported by not only price stability but also financial stability. Regarding this, Article 1, Clause 2 of the¡¸Bank of Korea Act¡¹ stipulates that ¡°The Bank of Korea needs to pay attention to financial stability in the implementation of monetary policy¡±. Thus, the Bank of Korea is also making policy efforts to maintain financial stability while pursuing price stability through implementing its monetary policy."

Born to first-generation immigrants from Samoa and Ethiopia, the 26-year-old grew up in the outskirts of Los Angeles but later moved to Bozeman, Montana, when he went to college.
It was there that he fell in love with the outdoors and the spectacular ice climbing opportunities Montana has to offer.
Ainuu taught himself how to climb and is now a seasoned professional, embarking on trips across the United States
But he says living in a predominately White area, whilst taking part in a sport with few other Black athletes, weighs heavily on him.
Despite not recalling any overtly racist incidents, the climber says it is more an accumulation of ""microaggressions"" from both the local and climbing community, such as people commentating on his dreadlocks.
""Most people are like 'Oh, it's a compliment, it's kindness,' but what it happens to be is kind of backhanded,"" Ainuu tells CNN Sport. ""They're seeing that you're different and feel like they have to say something about it.
""I'm pretty mellow, so I just ignore a lot of stuff. If someone says some stupid racist thing, I'm like: 'Whatever, I've heard this before.'
""But it really does weigh down on you. It all builds up and whether a person handles that by bottling it up or ignoring it, there's still an effect.""
With films such as ""Free Solo"" making it into the mainstream and with climbing gyms on the rise, the sport has witnessed a boom in recent years.
But the cost of clothing and safety equipment acts as a huge barrier to entry for many and the lack of representation amongst the world's top professionals is being recognized more than ever before.
Now a member of The North Face's elite climbing team, Ainuu wants to change the narrative around outdoor adventure sports.
""I don't really like being in the spotlight, having all this attention brought to me, but what I've realized is [...] there are so many people that are looking up to me [...] and all these other Black and African-American climbers or athletes or musicians,"" he says.
""Just seeing someone that looks like you, doing something and excelling at it is extremely empowering."""
other,"Equity and bond markets remain vulnerable to episodic bouts of volatility in a period of considerable uncertainty surrounding the evolution of global financial markets as well as around domestic developments which can impact market sentiment and liquidity conditions significantly, as the year gone by has shown. In the forex market, global developments _ particularly in the systemically important economies _ will continue to influence exchange rate developments, especially through the magnitude and direction of capital flows. Credit growth is accelerating and is also becoming broad-based, which bodes well for sustaining the pick-up in domestic economic activity that appears to have taken root since Q3. Going forward, liquidity conditions would be managed in a manner consistent with the Reserve Bank¡¯s policy stance of moving towards ex ante neutrality in order to facilitate closer alignment of the operating target of monetary policy _ the WACR _ with the policy repo rate.

other,"Since the MPC met in February 2017, indicators of global growth suggest signs of stronger activity in most advanced economies (AEs) and easing of recessionary conditions in commodity exporting large emerging market economies (EMEs). In the US, high frequency data indicate that the labour market, industrial production and retail sales are catalysing a recovery in Q1 of 2017 from a relatively subdued performance in the preceding quarter. Nonetheless, risks to higher growth have arisen from non-realisation or under-achievement of macroeconomic policies. In the Euro area, the manufacturing purchasing managers¡¯ index (PMI) rose to a six-year high in March amidst improving consumer confidence and steadily strengthening employment conditions. In the Japanese economy, nascent signs of revival are evident in the form of falling unemployment, improving business sentiment on fixed investment, and rising exports helped by the depreciation of the yen; however, deflation risks linger.For EMEs, the outlook is gradually improving, with indications that the slowdown characterising 2016 could be bottoming out. In China, supportive macroeconomic policies, surging credit growth and a booming property market have held up the momentum of growth albeit amidst concerns about financial stability and capital outflows. In Brazil, hardening commodity prices are providing tailwinds to reforms undertaken by the authorities to pull the economy out of recession, although financial fragilities remain a risk. Russia is benefiting from the firming up of crude prices and it is widely expected that growth will return to positive territory in 2017.Inflation is edging up in AEs to or above target levels on the back of slowly diminishing slack, tighter labour markets and rising commodity prices. Among EMEs, Turkey and South Africa remain outliers in an otherwise generalised softening of inflation pressures. Global trade volumes are finally showing signs of improvement amidst shifts in terms of trade, with exports rising strongly in several EMEs as well as in some AEs whose currencies have depreciated.International financial markets have been impacted by policy announcements in major AEs, geo-political events and country-specific factors. Equity markets in AEs were driven up by reflation trade, stronger incoming data and currency movements. Equity markets in EMEs had a mixed performance, reflecting domestic factors amidst a cautious return of investor appetite and capital flows. In the second half of March, dovish guidance on US monetary policy lifted equities across jurisdictions, especially in Asia, as the reach for EME assets resumed strongly, although doubts about the realisation of US policies, Brexit and softer crude prices tempered sentiments. Bond markets have mirrored the uncertainty surrounding the commitment to fiscal stimulus in the US and yields traded sideways in AEs, while they generally eased across EMEs. In the currency markets, the US dollar¡¯s bull run lost steam by mid-March. EME currencies initially rose on optimism on the global outlook, but some of them have weakened in recent days with the fall in commodity prices. Crude prices touched a three-month low in March on rising shale output and US inventories. Food prices have been firming up globally, driven by cereals."

wildfires,"There was a time when fire season in California started around May and went through September. Now, thanks to a drought that’s stretching into its fourth year, the state seems to have become a year-round tinderbox.
The long running drought has “created explosive fire conditions,” said Mike Mohler, a fire captain with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE). “Five years ago without a drought in California you would still get wildland fires. But the vegetation wouldn’t burn as quickly. Now there’s zero moisture and you get explosive fire growth.”
The drought has fed into a trend that’s been developing for over the past decade, said Daniel Berlant, chief of public information for CAL FIRE.
“Since 2000 we’ve been seeing larger and more damaging fires,” he said. “What we’re seeing now is that the rain is starting later and stopping much earlier. The fires are burning at explosive speed because the vegetation is so dry and that allows them to get much larger.”
It’s not just the low precipitation that’s the problem, Berlant says. It’s also the higher temperatures.
Those high temperatures are baking the moisture out of the soil and air, leaving vegetation especially dry and vulnerable to catching fire, said Park Williams, an assistant research professor at the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University.
Rising temperatures alone can boost the risk of wildfires, Williams said. “When you see wildfires in the Sierra Nevada and Northern Coast Ranges occurring early in the season it’s a testament to how warm conditions have become in spring,” he adds.
In a recent study published in the International Journal of Wildland Fire, Williams found that, in the Southwest, rising temperatures raised fire risk even in wetter years. That finding is likely to hold true for California, too, he said.
“Forests are excellent gauges of climate because they are not irrigated and they live for a very long time, allowing for tree-ring records and other aspects of forests to tell us how recent conditions fit into a long-term context,” Williams said. “As temperatures rise, the amount of water necessary to reduce a forest’s flammability goes up. In the absence of substantial increases in precipitation, warming causes increased flammability, and that very reliably translates to increased areas of forest burned.”"
wildfires,"A new wildfire in California grew to nearly 9,000 acres (3,700 hectares) on Friday, sending thousands of people fleeing and further stretching resources in a state struggling with a spate of wildfires this season.
The so-called Maria Fire erupted Thursday evening in Ventura County, 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of Los Angeles, and burned out of control through the night, driven by high winds and threatening 2,300 structures.
By Friday afternoon, the wind-fueled blaze that risked consuming citrus and avocado orchards as well as other crops was zero percent contained. Authorities said 8,000 people were under evacuation orders and at least two structures had been burned.
Ventura County Sheriff Bill Ayub said fire crews had been thwarted by people flying drones in the area.
""Last night and early morning we had individuals flying small drones in the area of the flight operations for the fire suppression,"" he told a media briefing.
""This creates a very significant hazard for our airborne fire fighting assets and causes them to land and stop firefighting efforts as long as that aircraft is in the area.""
The Maria Fire erupted as crews continue to battle multiple blazes that have broken out across the state in the last two weeks, prompting massive evacuations and power cuts.
Another fire, the Easy Fire, which broke out Wednesday in Ventura County and came dangerously close to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, was almost fully contained on Friday.
""We're in the middle of a big fight, and we're about a week into this and the end is not yet in sight,"" Ventura County Fire Chief Mark Lorenzen told reporters Friday afternoon.
""It has been an uphill battle ever since."" Up in Sonoma County, north of San Francisco, there was some good news as authorities reported that the Kincade Fire, the largest in the state this season, was 68 per cent contained.
The devastating fires that have exploded across the state this season were addressed by teen climate activist Greta Thunberg on Friday as she spoke at a rally in Los Angeles to pressure California lawmakers to pass stricter environmental policies."
other,"As set out above, domestic financial market segments have been mainly driven by idiosyncratic factors, barring phases of overwhelming global spillovers that impacted equity and forex markets intermittently. Excess liquidity, which had persisted till January following demonetisation, turned into deficit towards close of the year. Bond markets have experienced some drying up of liquidity as yields rose amidst concerns about inflation and the fiscal situation. The credit market, which was overcast with risk aversion and disintermediation, has exhibited a steady improvement in recent months with credit growth being in double digits since December. Sizeable investments by mutual funds into equity displaced the hitherto dominant position of foreign investors."
drought,"Meteorological drought events result from a prolonged deficiency of precipitation. If persistent, they can lead to decreased agricultural production, forest fires, inadequate public water supplies, reduced energy production, and even permanent land degradation and desertification. Their impacts are difficult to assess as they affect extended areas and can take months or even years to develop.
Recent damages caused by droughts in Europe were estimated at over €100 billion. Of the 21 major droughts that hit Europe from 1950 to 2012, six occurred after 2000. While water shortage has historically been common in southern European countries, almost the whole of Europe has been repeatedly affected by drought in the past 30 years, and especially in the past decade.
The objective of the report is to provide decision makers with comprehensive information on meteorological drought hotspots and trends for better managing drought challenges in the future. It describes the construction of the first ever database of European meteorological drought events that occurred from 1950 to 2012, classified by country and region according to their duration, severity, intensity, peak and area involved. It also develops a dataset of drought impacts based on damage functions that correlate the severity of the drought events with the impacts, which it tested on two sectors: cereal production and hydropower generation.
Global warming will be a key factor regarding the more extreme impacts of drought in Europe, particularly in the last decades of the 21st century. Future drought events are likely to be more frequent, longer, and more severe and intense in most of southern Europe, while increased precipitation in northern Europe is likely to lead to a reduction in the frequency, duration, severity and intensity of drought events. Results suggest that cereal yields and hydropower production are likely to be more often and more severely impacted in southern Europe, and less frequently and severely in northern Europe.
The new database of past European drought events can be used as the basis for studying their impacts in different sectors and to project the potential impacts of future events.  It is planned to apply the new methodologies to drought trends on a seasonal basis, different climate scenarios and other sectors of the economy."
other,"World trade volume growth is expected to have been robust in Q1, as gauged from the data on container trade throughput, air freight and export orders. Crude oil prices have become volatile in the recent period. After softening in February from multi-year highs on increased production in the US, crude prices hardened in the second half of March, driven by rebalancing of supply by OPEC and Russia, and drawdown of US inventories. Metal prices have come under selling pressure, with copper touching a three-month low in March on uncertainty stemming from global trade protectionism and US monetary policy. Gold prices, which touched a two-month low in March, have recently witnessed some uptick on fears of intensification of a trade war. Inflation remains below target in many key AEs and EMEs.Financial markets turned volatile in February-March, triggered by uncertainty regarding the pace of normalisation of US monetary policy, and concerns surrounding global trade. Equity markets globally have shed most of the gains of the previous quarter in a heavy sell off in February-March, caused by optimistic US job reports and the US imposition of new tariffs on Chinese goods. Yields in the US traded sideways on weaker than expected inflation pressures and the anticipated rate hike by the Fed. Yields in other major AEs have fallen, while among EMEs, they have remained divergent on country-specific factors. In currency markets, the US dollar, which recovered somewhat in early March on an optimistic outlook of the economy, shed most of its gains in the latter part of the month on a less hawkish stance of the Fed and on anxieties surrounding a possible trade war. Among other major currencies, the euro continued to appreciate on an improving growth outlook for the region. Most EME currencies have retreated in the wake of the recent market volatility and the improving US economic outlook, though investors continued to discriminate on country-specific factors."
other,"The Singapore economy will continue to expand at a modest pace in 2017. MAS Core Inflation is envisaged to rise gradually, largely on account of higher global oil prices. However, demand-driven inflationary pressures will likely be restrained. Over the medium term, core inflation is expected to trend towards but average slightly below 2%.  MAS will therefore maintain the rate of appreciation of the S$NEER policy band at zero percent. The width of the policy band and the level at which it is centred will be unchanged. As indicated in the October 2016 MPS, a neutral policy stance is appropriate for an extended period and should ensure medium-term price stability."
other,"Australia's new daily cases of Covid-19 topped 1,000 on Thursday for the first time since the global pandemic began, as two major hospitals in Sydney set up emergency outdoor tents to help deal with a rise in patients.
Sydney, the country's largest city and the epicenter of the current outbreak, is struggling to stamp out a surge in the fast-spreading Delta variant, with daily infections hitting record levels even after two months under lockdown.
The state of New South Wales (NSW), where Sydney is the capital, reported 1,029 new locally acquired cases, exceeding the previous record of 919 from a day earlier. Of the new cases, 969 were detected in greater Sydney, up from 838.
The rapid rise in Covid-19 patients has forced Sydney's Westmead and Blacktown hospitals, which service the city's sprawling western suburbs, to erect tents to screen and swab patients to help manage capacity.
The makeshift unit in the emergency department for Covid-19 patients will help ""to offload delays"", a Western Sydney Local Health District spokesperson told Reuters.
State Premier Gladys Berejiklian said authorities had quadrupled the number of the state's intensive care ventilators to 2,000 early last year. Although the system is ""under pressure"", it can withstand the current crisis once vaccination rates rise, she said.
""It might be different to the help you got before because of the situation, but please know the system is kicking in,"" Berejiklian said at a televised media conference.
Of 116 people in intensive care in NSW, 102 are not vaccinated. Three new deaths were reported, including a man in his 30s who died at home, taking deaths from the latest outbreak to 79, although the death rate has slowed since last year.
In a video posted on Twitter Wednesday night, the Australian Paramedic Association said paramedics were given a choice to wait in their vehicles with infected people or ""wait outside in the freezing rain"" due to the rise in patients.
The fast-moving Delta strain has taken the gloss off Australia's early success against the virus that kept its coronavirus numbers relatively low, with some 47,700 cases and 989 deaths. About 32% of people above 16 have been fully vaccinated while just over 54% have had at least one dose.
Besides Sydney, the country's second-largest city, Melbourne, and the capital, Canberra, are also in hard lockdowns, putting more than half of the country's 25 million population under strict stay-at-home orders."
Typhoon,"Heavy rain and howling winds are lashing the northern Philippines and Taiwan as Typhoon Usagi goes through the Luzon Strait which divides them.
Villages have been evacuated, ferries suspended and flights cancelled.
Meteorologists say the storm is the most powerful this year and will bring a cumulative rainfall of 1,000mm (39in) as it heads towards China.
The authorities there have announced a red alert ahead of the expected arrival of the storm on Monday.
The US Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Centre said on Friday that Usagi was packing sustained winds of 240 km/h (150 mph), with gusts of up to 296 km/h (185mph), making it the equivalent of a strong category four Atlantic hurricane.
Taiwan is reported to have deployed more than 1,600 soldiers in ""high risk"" areas prone to flooding and landslides while placing 24,000 others on standby.
Authorities in the Philippines are reported to have evacuated nearly 250 people in the northern agricultural province of Tarlac, while ferries are restricted to their ports.
There are particular concerns about the impact of the storm on the Batanes islands in the north of the Philippines, with warnings that large trees could be uprooted, plantations flattened and power and communications severely disrupted by flash flooding, landslides and storm surges."
other,"Going forward, the inflation trajectory is likely to be shaped by uncertainties impinging on the upside and the downside. The rising trajectory of international commodity prices, especially of crude, together with logistics costs, pose upside risks to the inflation outlook. Excise duties, cess and taxes imposed by the Centre and States need to be adjusted in a coordinated manner to contain input cost pressures emanating from petrol and diesel prices. A normal south-west monsoon along with comfortable buffer stocks should help to keep cereal price pressures in check. Recent supply side interventions are expected to ameliorate the tightness in the pulses market. Further supply side measures are needed to soften pressures on pulses and edible oil prices. With declining infections, restrictions and localised lockdowns across states could ease gradually and mitigate disruptions to supply chains, reducing cost pressures. Weak demand conditions may also temper the pass-through to core inflation. Taking into consideration all these factors, CPI inflation is projected at 5.1 per cent during 2021-22: 5.2 per cent in Q1; 5.4 per cent in Q2; 4.7 per cent in Q3; and 5.3 per cent in Q4:2021-22; with risks broadly balanced (Chart 1).Turning to the growth outlook, rural demand remains strong and the expected normal monsoon bodes well for sustaining its buoyancy, going forward. The increased spread of COVID-19 infections in rural areas, however, poses downside risks. Urban demand has been dented by the second wave, but adoption of new COVID-compatible occupational models by businesses for an appropriate working environment may cushion the hit to economic activity, especially in manufacturing and services sectors that are not contact intensive. On the other hand, the strengthening global recovery should support the export sector. Domestic monetary and financial conditions remain highly accommodative and supportive of economic activity. Moreover, the vaccination process is expected to gather steam in the coming months and should help to normalise economic activity quickly. Taking these factors into consideration, real GDP growth is now projected at 9.5 per cent in 2021-22, consisting of 18.5 per cent in Q1; 7.9 per cent in Q2; 7.2 per cent in Q3; and 6.6 per cent in Q4:2021-22 (Chart 2).The MPC notes that the second wave of COVID-19 has altered the near-term outlook, necessitating urgent policy interventions, active monitoring and further timely measures to prevent emergence of supply chain bottlenecks and build-up of retail margins. A hastened pace of the vaccination drive and quick ramping up of healthcare infrastructure across both urban and rural areas are critical to preserve lives and livelihoods and prevent a resurgence in new waves of infections. At this juncture, policy support from all sides _ fiscal, monetary and sectoral _ is required to nurture recovery and expedite return to normalcy. Accordingly, the MPC decided to retain the prevailing repo rate at 4 per cent and continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward.All members of the MPC _ Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das _ unanimously voted to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 4.0 per cent. Furthermore, all members of the MPC unanimously voted to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward."
valcano eruption,"UNHCR rushing to help displaced after volcano eruption in DR Congo This is a summary of what was said by UNHCR spokesperson Boris Cheshirkov _ to whom quoted text may be attributed _ at today's press briefing at the Palais des Nations in Geneva. Following the eruption of the Mount Nyiragongo volcano in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) on 22 May, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is assessing the needs of affected communities in the city of Goma. Thousands of people fled their homes on foot on Saturday night, carrying mattresses and other belongings as lava flowed towards Goma, burning down villages on the way. Many of them were welcomed by host families in Goma and surrounding areas, while several thousand fled across the border into Rwanda."
other,"Following weaker global economic conditions through the middle of the year, the recent economic data have generally been a little more positive. In the United States, growth is continuing at a moderate pace and there are now signs that growth may have stabilised in China, helped by a pick-up in infrastructure investment. In Europe, although economic activity across the region remains weak, reflecting in part the impact of fiscal consolidation, recent policy announcements have helped to stabilise financial conditions. Economic activity in east Asia has been weighed down by slower growth of global trade and consequently monetary and fiscal policies have been eased a little in some countries in the region.World GDP growth is currently expected to be around 3_ per cent in 2012 and to pick up gradually to 3_ per cent in 2013, which is around the long-run average. A modest recovery in the euro area during next year and a continuation of moderate US growth are expected to help boost growth in the east Asian economies to around its trend pace. This is likely to be supported by a gradual pick-up in growth in China in response to the earlier easing in financial conditions and a further modest easing in fiscal policy. While conditions are expected to improve gradually across the globe, activity in the euro area and the United States is expected to remain below potential for some time."
flood,"Thousands homeless as Sri Lanka floods death toll hits 17 Army relief workers in aluminium dinghies handed out rice and other food to residents in submerged parts of the Sri Lankan capital as the death toll from monsoon floods across the country rose to 17 Monday.  The monsoon hits the South Asian country twice a year, bringing vital rain for irrigation and hydro-power generation, but it can be deadly and destructive.  At least 17 people have died since Friday, after heavy downpours inundated 10 of the country's 25 districts.  ""Our kitchen is still flooded and we managed thanks to cooked food distributed by the military,"" Kusuma Dahanayake told AFP by telephone from Gampaha, the worst-affected district, just outside Colombo."
other,"In April 2013, MAS maintained the modest and gradual appreciation path of the S$NEER policy band, with no change to its slope, width, and the level at which it was centred.  This policy stance, which has been in place since April 2012, has helped to alleviate inflationary pressures and anchor inflation expectations, as well as facilitate the restructuring of the economy.   Over the last six months, the S$NEER remained in the upper half of the policy band.  It experienced some volatility, mainly reflecting market reactions to the prospective tapering of asset purchases by the US Federal Reserve.  More recently, the S$NEER appreciated on account of the relative weakness of regional currencies against the US$, as well as the Fed¡¯s decision in mid-September to defer tapering.  With global monetary conditions still accommodative, the domestic three-month interbank rate has remained low, averaging 0.40% from April through September 2013."
drought,"Ethiopia is in the grip of its worst drought in recent history. More than ten million people are in need of assistance according to the Government and humanitarian agencies. On Sunday 31 January, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) Executive Director Ertharin Cousin and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon visited Ethiopia to see first-hand the consequences of the drought in one of the worst affected areas.
Humanitarian needs in Ethiopia have tripled since early 2015 as severe drought in some regions, exacerbated by the strongest El Nino in decades, caused successive harvest failures and widespread livestock deaths.
Acute malnutrition has risen sharply, and one quarter of Ethiopia’s districts are now officially classified as facing a nutrition crisis. Out of 10.2 million people now requiring urgent humanitarian assistance, WFP is tasked with supporting the government in meeting the needs of 7.6 million people in 2016."
earthquake,"A magnitude 6.4 earthquake has struck Argentina's west-central province of San Juan on Monday night, according to a preliminary report from the United States Geological Survey.
A series of aftershocks around the country followed. A magnitude 5.0 aftershock struck 27 kilometers (about 16.8 miles) south-southwest of Nueve de Julio, around 1,000 km (620 miles) east of the first quake and almost 20 minutes later.
Then, a magnitude 4.9 quake came in the same area as the first, followed by a magnitude 5.3 aftershock.
The 4.9, 5.0 and 5.3-magnitude quakes are considered aftershocks as they are smaller in magnitude than the main quake and in the same area.
No injuries have been reported so far, according to San Juan Governor Sergio U?ac. Based on available data, there is no tsunami threat at this time, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC).
Speaking at a press conference early Tuesday, U?ac said local authorities are still analyzing the damage, which impacted streets and highways in the province. Some locations experienced power cuts, and homes experienced damage in the town of Caucete. Four people had to be evacuated from their homes in the town of Zonda, in San Juan.
The governor added that the electricity service is now gradually being reestablished. No public buildings have been damaged; some hospitals reported broken glass, but experienced no major structural damage.
U?ac urged people to stay calm after the quakes hit. ""Let's put into practice all the measures that we have learned to prevent incidents, while we are committed to knowing the impact of the (earthquake) to collaborate in everything necessary,"" he tweeted.
He added that the province was working with civil and security forces to respond, as well as with municipalities to respond to ""take care of them.""
In its preliminary statement, the PTWC recorded the depth of the quake at about 20 kilometers (12.43 miles)."
earthquake,"CANBERRA, Australia -- A strong, deep earthquake shook inland Papua New Guinea on Friday, and officials said there were no immediate reports of casualties or major damage.
Shaking was felt in the capital Port Moresby but not strongly.
The U.S. Geological Survey said the 7.0 magnitude quake was 80 kilometers (53 miles) deep. Shallower quakes tend to cause more surface damage.
The epicenter was close to Morobe Patrol Post, with a population of 15,000 in Morobe province. Locals reported on social media the wharf at Morobe Patrol Post had “cracked in half.""
Some damage was reported on social media in coastal villages. Residents were advised to go inland if there were any sign of tidal changes or irregular ocean patterns.
Mark Maniaol, a hotel employee in Lae, the capital of Morobe and the country's second-largest city, said he left the quake but it was not severe. He was not aware of any damage in the city.
The Morobe Provincial Disaster Office Director Charley Masange said he did not expect to receive damage reports from the epicenter until Saturday.
“The epicenter is in the mountains. Not many people live there and it's very remote so it takes a long time to get information,” Manage said. “I'm not expecting major damage.”
Papua New Guinea is prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions because it lies along the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” the string of faults around the Pacific Ocean where most of the world's seismic activity occurs."
drought,"As Texas continues to bake in record heat, the drought news for the state continues to be bleak _ Texas is now in the midst of its most severe one-year drought on record, according to John Nielsen-Gammon, the Texas State Climatologist and professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University.
Preliminary reports from the National Climatic Data Center indicate that July 2011 was the warmest month ever recorded statewide for Texas, with data going back to 1895, Nielsen-Gammon reports. The average temperature of 87.2 degrees broke the previous record of 86.5 degrees set in 1998. The June average temperature of 85.2 was a record for that month and now ranks fifth warmest overall.
Rainfall totals were also unusually light across the state. The July monthly total of 0.72 inches ranks third driest, surpassed by the 0.69 inches recorded in both 1980 and 2000. This is the fifth consecutive month in which precipitation totals were among the 10 driest for that month, says the Texas A&M professor.
Among the other rainfall records set this month: least year-to-date precipitation (6.53 inches; historical average 16.03 inches; previous record 9.36 inches in 1917); driest consecutive 8, 9 and 10 months on record (7.25 inches 8.35 inches, and 9.17 inches respectively); and driest 12 months ending in July (15.16 inches, previous record 16.46 inches in 1925)."
earthquake,"Rescuers race to find Turkey quake survivors, at least 39 dead BAYRAKLI, Turkey: Rescuers dug through heavy blocks of concrete with their bare hands on Saturday (Oct 31) in a desperate search for survivors from a powerful earthquake that levelled buildings across Greece and Turkey, killing at least 30 people. The 7.0-magnitude quake killed 28 people and injured nearly 900 in Turkey after striking on Friday afternoon near the west coast town of Seferihisar in Izmir province. Also killing two teenagers on their way home from school in Greece, it caused a mini-tsunami on the Aegean island of Samos and a sea surge that turned streets into rushing rivers in one Turkish coastal town. Felt in both Istanbul and Athens, it also created a diplomatic opening for the two historic rivals, with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis placing a rare call to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to offer his condolences and support."
drought,"Arizona is getting a jump start on what will be a yearslong process to address a dwindling but key water source in the U.S. West.
Several states and Mexico rely on the Colorado River for drinking water and growing crops. But climate change, drought and demand have taken a toll on the river that no longer can deliver what was promised in the 1920s.
Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, California, Utah, Wyoming and Nevada have been operating under a set of guidelines approved in 2007. Those guidelines and an overlapping drought contingency plan will expire in 2026.
Arizona water officials gathered Thursday to outline a plan for what comes next. Other states in the river basin have had more informal discussions.
“Hold on to your seats because the reconsultation will be technical and complicated, and it will take a long time,” said Ted Cooke, general manager of the Central Arizona Project, who is co-chairing Arizona’s effort.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation is reviewing the effectiveness of the 2007 guidelines that address shortages and surpluses of water, and efforts to conserve water in Lake Mead along the Nevada-Arizona border. A draft is expected in August, and a final report in December.
“It’s prudent water management to review how well something has worked before determining what might replace it,” said Carly Jerla of the Bureau of Reclamation.
When those guidelines went into effect, the river had been in drought conditions for several years. It hasn’t let up. A drought contingency plan approved by the Western states last year was meant as a stop-gap. It requires Arizona, Nevada and Mexico to prop up Lake Mead earlier than under the 2007 guidelines. It also looped in California for water cuts.
A Reclamation audit published last month found that water use in the Colorado River’s lower basin dropped by more than 575,000 acre-feet from 2018 to 2019, a level not seen since 1986. That allowed Lake Mead and Lake Powell — key indicators of the river’s health — to increase by several feet but both remain well below capacity.
As of this week, Mead was 41% full. Powell, along the Arizona-Utah line, was 53% full.
Arizona is looking to build upon the work done on the drought contingency plan. The committee of about three dozen people that worked it helps develop what might replace the existing guidelines, focusing on how to sustain the river while meeting the state’s water needs, officials said."
other,"Monetary policy affects aggregate demand and the level of economic activity by increasing or decreasing the availability of credit, which can be seen through decreasing or increasing interest rates. Recall that an open market purchase by the Fed adds reserves to the banking system. Banks turn those reserves into new loans, making credit available to more borrowers and increasing the supply of money.Consider the market for loanable bank funds, shown in Figure 1. The original equilibrium (E0) occurs at an interest rate of 8% and a quantity of funds loaned and borrowed of $10 billion. An open market purchase by the Fed will shift the supply of loanable funds to the right from the original supply curve (S0) to S1, leading to an equilibrium (E1) with a lower interest rate of 6% and a quantity of funds loaned of $14 billion. This is an example of an expansionary monetary policy.Conversely, an open market sale by the Fed reduces the amount of reserves in the banking system which requires banks to decrease their loans outstanding, reducing the availability of credit and decreasing the supply of money. This will shift the supply of loanable funds to the left from the original supply curve (S0) to S2, leading to an equilibrium (E2) with a higher interest rate of 10% and a quantity of funds loaned of $8 billion. This is an example of contractionary monetary policy."
wildfires,"Thousands of people have fled their homes in northern Alberta where two out-of-control wildfires breached a town's defences and have burned down hundreds of buildings, including the town hall, police station and the radio station.
The RCMP said the Town of Slave Lake is on fire and many homes have burned down. The fire is apparently out of control, engulfing about half of the town.
The fires are in the north and east portion of the town, but winds are slowing down, giving officials hope the fires could be brought under control.
But residents are describing chaos.
""It's horrible; it's just going to spread because houses are ten feet apart,"" Myrna Franklin told CTV Edmonton. ""Our house is out of town, I don't know if it's gone yet or not.""
The Town of Slave Lake has issued a mandatory evacuation order and there have been reports that police are arresting anyone who does not comply.
""We are asking people who are able to travel and have the fuel to get to Athabasca, to leave the community,"" Mayor Karina Pillay said. ""If they do not have transportation or fuel we are asking them to come down to the Northern Lakes College (evacuation centre) and register with us.""
Earlier Sunday, the highways leading out of the town were blocked, forcing officials to tell people to flee to parking lots, the beach or any other wide-open green space.
But one highway is running late Sunday, and residents are now told to get out. Traffic is moving out, but at a slow pace.
There have been no reports of injuries yet, but communication is troublesome as power keeps going out. The local radio station was issuing emergency reports until it succumbed to fire.
There are about 200 firefighters in the town but conditions are lined up against them. Wind gusts of up to 100 kilometres an hour, have made water-bombers ineffective.
The first fire broke out to the southwest of Slave Lake, at about noon local time on Saturday.
The second blaze started to the east of Slave Lake in the Poplar Lane and Mitsue area.
The town has declared a local state of emergency and set up evacuation centres for those without a place to stay."
earthquake,"“The Secretary-General extends his condolences to the families of the victims, as well as to the people and Government of Turkey”, UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said in a statement issued on Saturday. “He wishes those injured a speedy recovery”.
Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority, AFAD, said that 25 people were killed in Elazig province _ some 465 miles east of the capital, Ankara _ and four in the neighbouring province of Malatya.
And the country’s Health Minister recorded more than 1,450 injured people.
State media in Syria and Iran both reported feeling tremors in their countries, and local media in Lebanon said that Beirut and Tripoli also felt the quake.
More than 400 aftershocks have been recorded, 14 of which had magnitudes over 4.0, according to AFAD.

Hundreds of residents were left homeless or with damaged homes as rescue teams from neighboring provinces worked throughout the night with floodlights, using their hands, drills and mechanical diggers to remove bricks and plaster from collapsed buildings in search of survivors."
other,"The Australian economy is gradually coming out of a soft patch. GDP growth has been recovering since its low point last year; it picked up a little in the first half of 2019 and moderate growth is expected over the remainder of the year. Growth is expected to reach 2_ per cent over 2020 and around 3 per cent by the end of 2021. This outlook is largely unchanged from three months ago, and is supported by the low level of interest rates, recent tax cuts, ongoing spending on infrastructure, the upswing in housing prices in some markets and a brighter outlook for the resources sector.The labour market has been resilient to this period of slow growth. In particular, employment has continued to expand noticeably faster than growth in the working-age population. Labour supply has increased to meet rising demand, with the participation rate at record highs in recent months. The unemployment rate has been broadly steady at around 5_ per cent for some months. It is expected to decline only gradually over the next couple of years, to a little below 5 per cent. At this level, the unemployment rate will still be somewhat short of the central estimate of the rate consistent with full employment, of around 4_ per cent."
earthquake,"An estimated magnitude 4.2 earthquake was recorded Friday in a rural area along Oklahoma's border with Kansas, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
The earthquake was recorded at 7:56 a.m. near Manchester, a town of about 100 residents about 100 miles (161 kilometers) north of Oklahoma City, the USGS reported.
Grant County Commissioner Max Hess, whose district includes Manchester, said no injuries or damage were reported.
The rural area in northern Oklahoma is about 55 miles (89 kilometers) northwest of where a recent series of earthquakes were recorded. Geologists say those quakes were likely connected to the underground injection of wastewater that is produced by oil and gas companies.
In response to the quakes, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission ordered oil and gas operators to stop disposal of wastewater within 3 miles (5 kilometers) of the earthquake epicenters and to reduce disposal volumes within 3 to 10 miles (5 to 16 kilometers) of the epicenters."
wildfires,"Wildfires, peat fires and controlled burns on farming lands kill 339,000 people worldwide each year, said a study released on Saturday that is the first to estimate a death toll for landscape fires.
Most of those deaths are concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa, where an estimated 157,000 people die as a result of being exposed to such fires annually, with southeast Asia ranking second with 110,000 deaths.
""I was surprised at our estimate being so high when you consider that the exposure to fire smoke is quite intermittent for most people,"" said lead author Fay Johnston of the University of Tasmania.
""Even in southeast Asia and Africa, (fire) is a seasonal phenomenon. It is not year round,"" Johnston said at the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting in Vancouver where she presented her research.
The study, which Johnston said was the first of its kind to attempt to estimate a death toll from wildfires and landscape burns, was published Saturday in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives.
Researchers looked at the number of deaths from all causes in areas that were exposed to heavy smoke and landscape fire between 1997 and 2006.
They used satellite data and chemical transport models to assess the health impacts of particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers, a major byproduct of landscape fire smoke.
The number of deaths from wildfires came in far below the previously estimated global tolls for indoor air pollution at two million people per year and urban air pollution at 800,000.
However, the study authors said their findings indicated that ""fire emissions are an important contributor to global mortality.""
The research also suggested a significant link between climate and fire mortality.
About twice as many people died during El Nino years when the surface ocean temperature rises in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean (averaging 532,000) as during cooler La Nina years (averaging 262,000)."

Hundreds of people have been forced to leave the island of Evia, as fire destroyed houses and power lines.
A team of 21 firefighters, which includes officers from Merseyside, West Midlands, London, Lancashire and South Wales, arrived in Greece on Sunday.
Team leader Nick Searle said the scale of what they faced was ""unprecedented"".
The deputy chief fire officer, who serves with Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service and is co-ordinating the support effort, said the fires were ""very scary"".
He said the team were ""hard at work"", but the conditions were not making the job easy.
We've all seen the high temperatures throughout Europe and if you twin that with high winds, that really is an explosive mixture,"" he said."
other,"The overall condition of the labor market continued to strengthen over the first half of 2015, albeit at a more moderate pace than in 2014. So far this year, payroll employment has increased by about 210,000 on average per month compared with the robust 260,000 average in 2014, and the unemployment rate has declined about 1/4 percentage point to 5.3 percent in June, close to most Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants' estimates of its longer-run normal level. Other measures of labor market activity also point to ongoing improvement in labor market conditions even as they continue to suggest that further improvement is needed to achieve the Committee's maximum employment mandate. In particular, the labor force participation rate has generally been holding steady but nevertheless remains below most assessments of its trend, and the number of people working part time when they would prefer full-time employment has declined further but remains elevated. And, while some measures of labor compensation are starting to rise more rapidly, they nevertheless remain consistent with the view that labor resources likely are still not being fully utilized."

other,"Many safety and security features and measures for redress of grievances have been ushered in by the Reserve Bank of India for enhanced digital payments experience of users. The Payment Systems Vision document of RBI envisages setting up a 24x7 helpline for addressing customer queries in respect of various digital payment products. The helpline will, in addition to building trust and confidence, also reduce expenditure on both financial and human resources, otherwise incurred for addressing queries and grievances. The major payment system operators would be required to facilitate setting-up of a centralised industry-wide 24x7 helpline for addressing customer queries in respect of various digital payment products and give information on available grievance redress mechanisms by September 2021. Going forward, the facility of registering and resolving the customer complaints through the helpline shall be considered.The operators and participants of various authorised payment systems carry out a bouquet of specialised activities on account of the products offered by them and design of payment systems they operate. Often, such activities are outsourced to optimise efficiency and lower costs. However, vulnerabilities in the systems of entities who provide such outsourced services can pose cyber security risks to the principal entity. To manage the attendant risks in outsourcing and ensure that a code of conduct is adhered to while outsourcing payment and settlement related services, the Reserve Bank shall issue guidelines to operators and participants of authorised payment systems.The Cheque Truncation System (CTS) is in use since 2010 and presently covers around 1,50,000 branches across three cheque processing grids. All the erstwhile 1219 non-CTS clearing houses have since been migrated to CTS. It is observed that about 18,000 bank branches are still outside any formal clearing arrangement. In order to bring operational efficiency in paper based clearing and make the process of collection and settlement of cheques faster resulting in better customer service, it is proposed to bring all such branches under the CTS clearing mechanism by September 2021. Separate operational guidelines will be issued in a month¡¯s time.Financial consumer protection has gained significant policy priority across jurisdictions. In line with the global initiatives on consumer protection, RBI has taken various initiatives to strengthen Grievance Redress Mechanism of regulated entities. As an alternate dispute resolution mechanism, three Ombudsman schemes, i.e. (i) Banking Ombudsman Scheme (ii) Ombudsman Scheme for Non-Banking Financial Companies and (iii) Ombudsman Scheme for Digital Transactions are in operation from 22 ombudsman offices of RBI located across the country. RBI had operationalised complaint management system (CMS) portal as one stop solution for alternate dispute resolution of customer complaints not resolved satisfactorily by the regulated entities. To make the alternate dispute redress mechanism simpler and more responsive to the customers of regulated entities, it has been decided to implement, inter alia, integration of the three Ombudsman schemes and adoption of the ¡®One Nation One Ombudsman¡¯ approach for grievance redressal. This is intended to make the process of redress of grievances easier by enabling the customers of the banks, NBFCs and non-bank issuers of PPIs to register their complaints under the integrated scheme, with one centralised reference point. The Integrated Ombudsman Scheme will be rolled out in June 2021."

Cristobal is now the third named storm of the season. It's the earliest a third named storm has ever formed. 2020 Atlantic Hurricane Season Facts >>> Right now Cristobal is a tropical storm with sustained winds of 40 mph with higher gusts. It is moving to the southwest at 3 mph. On its current track, it is expected to continue to interact with southern Mexico over the next several days. The main risk for this storm will continue to be rain. Ten to 20 inches of rain is possible across the Mexican states of Tabasco, Veracrus and Campeche. There could be isolated amounts of more than 2 feet of rain. Some of the Pacific locations in southern Mexico received 20 inches of rain over the weekend, and could get an additional foot of rain. According to the National Hurricane Center, ""Rainfall in all of these areas may produce life-threatening flash floods and mudslides."" ""The Bay of Campeche is notoriously the warmest part of the Gulf region this time of year,"" said CNN Meteorologist Chad Myers. In fact, sea surface temperatures for this area are running 3-4 degrees Fahrenheit above normal right now, providing a lot of fuel for the storm."
wildfires,"Firefighters are battling to keep a large bushfire which has come within 700 metres of a small township on an Australian holiday island at bay.
Dozens of residents of Happy Valley were earlier urged to evacuate as the blaze raged east across Fraser Island.
For six weeks, firefighters have been struggling to control the blazes on the island - a popular tourist destination off the coast of Queensland.
However efforts have been thwarted by a continuing heatwave and dry ground.
The bushfire was sparked by an illegal campfire in mid-October and has burnt through over half of the island - about 83,000 hectares."
other,"On April 4, 1955, a massive crowd flocked to Taiwan's Keelung Harbor.
Firecrackers were lit. Champagne corks popped. Speeches were made.
The celebratory atmosphere was a rare spectacle in Taiwan at the time. The island was in the midst of the first Taiwan Strait crisis against the Communists in mainland China, while the effects of World War II and the Korean War lingered.
Politicians, media and residents of Keelung City had come out to bid farewell to the Free China, a half-century-old junk boat, and its six crew members.
The boat's name was bestowed by the governor of Taiwan -- a reference to the ongoing battle with the mainland -- who sponsored part of the adventure after reading about the crew's ambitious plans in a newspaper. A special commemorative postmark was even created for the occasion.
Carrying the hopes and dreams of the six crew members and their supporters, this small junk boat with a politically laden name was about to set sail across the Pacific Ocean to compete in an international yacht race.
The event would kick off on the other side of the world, starting from Newport, Rhode Island in the US, ending across the Atlantic in Gothenburg, Sweden.
There was just one problem. What the revelers in Keelung Harbor didn't realize was that none of the five Chinese crew, nor the American vice-consul who joined at the last minute, knew how to sail a junk boat."
wildfires,"While the summer can mean warm weather, swimsuits, and sunshine, it can also mean wildfire season for parts of North America. And so far, the 2015 wildfire season has been a damaging one across the Pacific Northwest, western Canada, and Alaska in June and July.
In the far north, Alaska’s 2015 wildfire season tally is already over 700 fires, ranking it ninth in history.  (The typical fire season ends during August.) The fires have burned nearly 5 million acres, the fourth largest total already and only 200,000 acres away from #2 in the rankings.  For perspective, the state’s largest wildfire season on record, 2004, saw 6.5 million acres burned in 701 fires. This year is already at 708 fires which have burned or are burning around 4.8 million acres (numbers as of July 22 from Alaska’s division of Forestry). Fires have destroyed dozens of buildings, and several communities required partial evacuations during June.
Farther south in western/central Canada, wildfires have burned through extensive areas. In an average year, Canada sees around 8,000 fires, which burn around 8,100 square miles. As of July 22, according to the Canadian National Forestry Database, 5,603 fires have burned almost 15,000 square miles of land. That total is larger than the state of Maryland."
other,"With unemployment well above normal levels and inflation subdued, progress toward the Federal Reserve's mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability has required a highly accommodative monetary policy. Under normal circumstances, policy accommodation would be provided through reductions in the FOMC's target for the federal funds rate--the interest rate on overnight loans between banks. However, as this rate has been close to zero since December 2008, the Federal Reserve has had to use alternative policy tools.These alternative tools have fallen into two categories. The first is ""forward guidance"" regarding the FOMC's anticipated path for the federal funds rate. Since longer-term interest rates reflect market expectations for shorter-term rates over time, our guidance influences longer-term rates and thus supports a stronger recovery. The formulation of this guidance has evolved over time. Between August 2011 and December 2012, the Committee used calendar dates to indicate how long it expected economic conditions to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate. At its December 2012 meeting, the FOMC agreed to shift to providing more explicit guidance on how it expects the policy rate to respond to economic developments. Specifically, the December postmeeting statement indicated that the current exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate ""will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.""2 An advantage of the new formulation, relative to the previous date-based guidance, is that it allows market participants and the public to update their monetary policy expectations more accurately in response to new information about the economic outlook. The new guidance also serves to underscore the Committee's intention to maintain accommodation as long as needed to promote a stronger economic recovery with stable prices.The second type of nontraditional policy tool employed by the FOMC is large-scale purchases of longer-term securities, which, like our forward guidance, are intended to support economic growth by putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates. The Federal Reserve has engaged in several rounds of such purchases since late 2008. Last September the FOMC announced that it would purchase agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month, and in December the Committee stated that, in addition, beginning in January it would purchase longer-term Treasury securities at an initial pace of $45 billion per month.4 These additional purchases of longer-term Treasury securities replace the purchases we were conducting under our now-completed maturity extension program, which lengthened the maturity of our securities portfolio without increasing its size. The FOMC has indicated that it will continue purchases until it observes a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in a context of price stability."

Typhoon,"Another busy hurricane season appears likely, although it won’t be as bad as last year, according to a prediction released Wednesday by AccuWeather, a private weather forecasting service.
The prediction calls for seven to 10 hurricanes. Three to five of these are expected to reach major hurricane strength, which means winds of at least 111 mph.
“Current indications are this will be another above-normal season,” said Dan Kottlowski, AccuWeather’s lead hurricane forecaster. “This can translate into high impacts on the United States.”
The season still is unlikely to be as busy as last year’s record-breaking season, which generated 30 storms, including 13 hurricanes, subjecting the United States to 12 direct hits and exhausting the storm names selected for that year.
But the danger to the U.S. east coast may be higher this year because of the weakening of the Bermuda high, a high-pressure zone that last year stiff-armed many storms into the Gulf of Mexico. This year, the Bermuda high’s rim could be farther northeast, allowing storms to curve north earlier and strike the east coast.
The Accu-Weather forecast cited warm Atlantic temperatures as one factor in the prediction of an active season.
Hurricane season officially starts June 1, although there’s been discussion of shifting the date into May, since the past few years have produced several pre-season storms."
other,"As stated earlier, headline inflation dynamics in H1:2018-19 have reflected divergent movements among constituents which are revealed when momentum and base effects are disentangled. In the case of food items, there has been an unusually low momentum in prices of vegetables and an unexpected decline in prices of fruits in H1. In Q2, base effects turned favourable and along with unseasonally low momentum pulled down food inflation to just 1.3 per cent (up to August 2018) well below its quarterly trend level of six years (7.1 per cent). In the case of items excluding food and fuel, momentum in prices remained strong during April-May in Q1. Thereafter, in Q2 so far, momentum effects have been offset by favourable base effects. As a result, the monotonic hardening of headline inflation from 4.3 per cent in March 2018 to 4.9 per cent by June reversed and inflation fell to 3.7 per cent in August (Chart II.3).On an average, the distribution of inflation across CPI groups in 2018 so far had striking similarities with the outcomes in 2017, a period that also saw soft inflation readings coming from moderation in food inflation in the post-demonetisation period. Median inflation rates were in the range of 4.3-4.8 per cent in both the years and inflation exhibited considerable negative skew on account of deflation in pulses and sugar prices (Chart II.4). Diffusion indices of price changes in CPI items suggest that on a seasonally adjusted basis, a broadening swathe of goods and almost all services have experienced price increases since July, implying that soft headline inflation reading is occurring alongside generalised price increases across goods and services (Chart II.5)."
other,"Turning to the domestic economy, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) released its second advance estimates for 2017-18 on February 28, revising India¡¯s real gross domestic product (GDP) growth marginally upward to 6.6 per cent from 6.5 per cent in the first advance estimates released on January 5. GDP growth in 2017-18 at 6.6 per cent was lower than 7.1 per cent in 2016-17 and the deceleration was broad-based, but each component revealed intra-year turning points. Private consumption growth _ whose contribution to GDP growth in 2017-18 was 68 per cent _ moderated in the second half. Goods and services tax (GST) implementation had an adverse, even if transient, effect on urban consumption through loss of output and employment in the labour-intensive unorganised sector. Government expenditure provided sustained support to aggregate demand, with a pick-up in pace in the second half. Gross fixed capital formation turned around in Q2 and accelerated in the second half _ markedly so in Q3 _ reflecting the first signs of a sustained expansion in capital goods production and a modest revival of construction activity. Net exports dragged down aggregate demand in 2017-18 due to a surge in imports and deceleration in exports in Q3, the latter being driven in part by GST-related working capital disruptions.For Q4, high frequency indicators point to a further strengthening of demand conditions. Private consumption seems to be improving on the back of strong growth in domestic air passenger traffic and foreign tourist arrivals, rising sales growth of passenger vehicles and a strong upturn in the production of consumer durables. The growth in sales of two-wheelers and tractors reflects buoyant rural consumption. Capital goods production registered a 19-month high growth in January 2018, indicative of the likely traction in investment demand. Housing loans extended by banks have increased significantly, which is a positive for residential investment. External demand remains a weak link. Merchandise import growth has slowed because of gold imports; simultaneously export growth has also weakened."
drought,"A potent combination of record-breaking heat and a lack of rain has led to the rapid development of drought across the southeastern United States and Tennessee and Ohio Valleys during September 2019. Coming off an extremely wet 2018 east of the Rockies, the fast onset of widespread extensive drought has been quite the climate whiplash for millions across the Southeast.  With warmer than average temperatures expected to continue and October being a generally dry month based on climatology, drought conditions are likely to continue and possibly expand and intensify over the next week.
The extent to which drought has overtaken the southeastern United States by the end of September would have been hard to explain to residents of the region just a month prior.  While a few localized areas in Georgia/Alabama were already mired in drought, the broader region extending into the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys was drought free. In fact, the twelve-month period (September 2018-August 2019) coming to an end was record wet. But then, while it continued to be hot, things turned incredibly dry.
The rapid onset and severity of the event qualified it as a “Flash drought.” Generally, droughts are caused by a lack of precipitation over an extended period of time. In contrast, a flash drought is preceded not just by a lack of rain, but also very high temperatures and/or lots of sunny days. Even if the dry period is not especially severe, the latter two can suck moisture from the ground quickly.
For operational purposes, NOAA National Weather Service’s Climate Prediction Center defines a flash drought as an event during which an area experiences degradation by two or more drought categories in a four week period, based on the U.S. Drought Monitor."

other,"The baseline scenario assumes global growth to gain upward momentum during 2018, buoyed by the boost to US investment demand from corporate tax cuts, strong activity in the euro area supported by accommodative monetary policy and improvement in growth prospects of EMEs. There are upside risks to the baseline with the synchronised cyclical rebound, revival of global trade and easy financing conditions reinforcing each other. If global growth turns out to be 50 bps over the baseline, it could strengthen domestic growth by 20 bps above the baseline and raise domestic inflation by around 10 bps.On the other hand, protectionist policies, continuing uncertainty associated with the pace and timing of normalisation of monetary policy in the US and other systemic central banks, and higher crude oil prices pose downside risks to global demand. In such a scenario, if global demand weakens by 50 bps vis-¨¤-vis the baseline, domestic growth and inflation could be 20 bps and around 10 bps, respectively, below the baseline."

earthquake,"At least 9 dead in Turkey after magnitude 5.7 earthquake strikes northwest Iran ISTANBUL — Nine people died and hundreds of buildings collapsed in southeastern Turkey on Sunday after a magnitude-5.7 earthquake struck near the border with Iran, injuring dozens in villages and towns in both countries, government officials said. Three of those killed were children and 37 Turkish people were injured, including nine critically, Turkey's health ministry said. The shallow tremor caused more than 1,000 buildings to collapse in Turkey, prompting a brief rescue effort to find those trapped under rubble. The quake damaged buildings some 56 miles to the west in the Turkish city of Van, and to the east in dozens of villages in Iran, where state TV said 75 people were injured including six in hospital, though there were no fatalities. Turkish TV footage showed people digging with shovels and their hands in the rubble, as well as furniture and belongings strewn on cracked and snowy roads. In one village the ground cratered under several buildings, while in others residents were wrapped in blankets outside homes with crumbled and cracked exterior walls, fallen metal roofs and twisted wiring. ""The damage caused loss of life,"" the governor of Van, Mehmet Bilmez, told reporters standing in front of a pile of cinder blocks and sheet metal. ""There is destruction in all four villages"" he visited on Sunday morning, he added. The European Mediterranean Seismological Center (EMSC) said the quake, which hit at 8:53 a.m. local time, had a depth of 3.1 miles.

other,"The U.S. economy performed impressively in 2005. Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased a bit more than 3 percent, building on the sustained expansion that gained traction in the middle of 2003. Payroll employment rose 2 million in 2005, and the unemployment rate fell below 5 percent. Productivity continued to advance briskly.The economy achieved these gains despite some significant obstacles. Energy prices rose substantially yet again, in response to increasing global demand, hurricane-related disruptions to production, and concerns about the adequacy and reliability of supply. The Gulf Coast region suffered through severe hurricanes that inflicted a terrible loss of life; destroyed homes, personal property, businesses, and infrastructure on a massive scale; and displaced more than a million people. The storms also damaged facilities and disrupted production in many industries, with substantial effects on the energy and petrochemical sectors and on the region's ports. Full recovery in the affected areas is likely to be slow. The hurricanes left an imprint on aggregate economic activity as well, seen, in part, in the marked deceleration of real GDP in the fourth quarter. However, the most recent evidence--including indicators of production, the flow of new orders to businesses, weekly data on initial claims for unemployment insurance, and the payroll employment and retail sales figures for January--suggests that the economic expansion remains on track.Inflation pressures increased in 2005. Steeply rising energy prices pushed up overall inflation, raised business costs, and squeezed household budgets. Nevertheless, the increase in prices for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, at just below 2 percent, remained moderate, and longer-term inflation expectations appear to have been contained."

earthquake,"A ferocious tsunami spawned by one of the largest earthquakes ever recorded slammed Japan’s eastern coast Friday, killing hundreds of people as it swept away boats, cars and homes while widespread fires burned out of control.
Hours later, the tsunami hit Hawaii and warnings blanketed the Pacific, putting areas on alert as far away as South America, Canada, Alaska and the entire U.S. West Coast. In Japan, the area around a nuclear power plant in the northeast was evacuated after the reactor’s cooling system failed.
Police said 200 to 300 bodies were found in the northeastern coastal city of Sendai, the city in Miyagi prefecture (state) closest to the quake’s epicenter. Another 88 were confirmed killed and at least 349 were missing. The death toll was likely to continue climbing given the scale of the disaster.
The magnitude-8.9 offshore quake unleashed a 23-foot (seven-meter) tsunami and was followed by more than 50 aftershocks for hours, many of them of more than magnitude 6.0.
Dozens of cities and villages along a 1,300-mile (2,100-kilometer) stretch of coastline were shaken by violent tremors that reached as far away as Tokyo, hundreds of miles (kilometers) from the epicenter.

earthquake,"A rare earthquake centered in Virginia rattled parts of New Jersey and New York shortly before 2 p.m. today, causing buildings to sway in cities and towns across the region.
There were no immediate reports of any injuries or structural damage, but the quake rattled nerves.
The U.S. Geological Survey reported that a magnitude 5.9 earthquake hit at 1:51 p.m. and the epicenter was northwest of Richmond, Va., about halfway to Charlottesville. The Associated Press is reporting the quake was felt in Washington, D.C., New York City and North Carolina.
The quake was later downgraded to a magnitude 5.8.
U.S.G.S. Geophysicist Julie Dutton said an earthquake of this magnitude is rare for the East Coast but that the effects are felt widely in our region because quakes move more easily through the bedrock."
other,"Global trade continued to expand, underpinned by strong investment and robust manufacturing activity. Crude oil prices touched a three-year high as production cuts by the OPEC coupled with falling inventories weighed on the global demand-supply balance. Bullion prices touched a multi-month high on a weak US dollar. Inflation remained contained in most AEs, barring the UK, on subdued wage pressures. Inflation was divergent in key EMEs due to country-specific factors.Financial markets have become volatile in recent days due to uncertainty over the pace of normalisation of the US Fed monetary policy in view of January payrolls data showing rapidly accelerating wage growth and better than expected employment. The volatility index (VIX) has climbed to its highest level since Brexit. Equity markets have witnessed a sharp correction, both in AEs and EMEs. Bond yields in the US have hardened sharply, adding to the upward pressures seen during January, with concomitant rise in bond yields in other AEs and EMEs. Forex markets have become volatile as well. Until this episode of recent volatility, global financial markets were buoyed by investor appetite for risk, corporate tax cuts by the US, and stable economic conditions. Equity markets had gained significantly in January, driven by robust Chinese growth, uptick in commodity prices, and positive corporate sentiment in general. In currency markets, the US dollar had touched a multi-month low on February 1 on fiscal risks and improving growth prospects in other AEs."
other,"A preliminary ruling by a three-judge panel in North Carolina is clearing the way for roughly 56,000 of the state's residents who have been convicted of felonies -- but who aren't currently serving prison time -- to register to vote, civil rights groups said.
The action comes out of a lawsuit by civil rights groups and ex-offenders who have challenged a North Carolina law that denies the right to vote to felons until they have completed all aspects of their sentence, including probation and parole.
On Monday, Superior Court Judge Lisa Bell told participants during a brief hearing that two judges on a three-judge panel would issue a preliminary injunction that bars the state from denying voter registration from North Carolinians convicted of felonies who were on probation, parole or post-release supervision, voting rights groups said.
The ruling was made verbally and no written order has been issued yet. Kellie Myers, the trial court administrator in the Wake County, North Carolina, judicial district handling the case, confirmed the preliminary injunction in a statement to CNN. She said it applies to people convicted in federal and state courts and takes effect immediately.
As a result, the North Carolina State Board of Elections announced that county boards of elections across the state ""must immediately begin to permit such individuals to register to vote.""
Voting rights groups say the ruling marks the largest expansion of the franchise in the state since the Voting Rights Act of 1965. And plaintiffs said the North Carolina law disproportionately affected African Americans.
""History has been made in North Carolina,"" Diana Powell, executive director of Justice Served NC, said during a virtual news conference about the decision. ""A change has come!""
An appeal of the ruling is still possible. And the court still has to issue a final ruling on a trial it conducted on the lawsuit last week on the constitutionality of the North Carolina statute. The state board of elections officials said their attorneys are reviewing Monday's decision and will consider ""the written ruling upon its release."""
other,"The recovery in economic activity, which began in Q2:2017-18, seems to be robust. Consumption is expected to remain resilient, buoyed by rising income levels and staggered implementation of the 7th Central Pay Commission (CPC) award at the states¡¯ level in the urban areas. Rural consumption is likely to remain strong in view of the sizeable hike in MSPs and debt waivers by the states. The record agricultural production achieved in recent years, is expected to be maintained on the back of a hike in MSPs of kharif crops, normal monsoon rains in most of the kharif crop growing regions of the country and comfortable water reservoir storage. Easier supply conditions in the agrarian economy support backward and forward linkages and thereby brighten the prospects for the manufacturing and services sectors. Upbeat construction activity, fading away of the slack in banking sector financial intermediation activities, and higher public expenditure in an election year, suggest that stability of services sector growth would be maintained.A more durable momentum in investment activity holds the key to sustaining the Indian economy on the higher growth path that has become evident in the last two quarters. Rising capacity utilisation and improving credit offtake bode well for investment gaining traction. The deteriorating global trade and geo-political environment are, however, negative risks to the investment outlook."

In Sabah, there were  4,999 flood victims as at 8 am today, from 5,037 people yesterday afternoon.  Sabah Disaster Management Committee Secretariat, in a statement today, said  the flood victims, who are in the Tenom and Beaufort districts, are housed at 41 relief centres (PPS), which were opened in stages since last Thursday.  “Tenom still recorded the highest number of flood victims at 4,396 people involving 1,269 families at 37 PPS,  with most of them, involving 476 victims, at the PPS at Dewan Sri Onmtoros,  while Beaufort has 603 victims at four PPS, with Dewan DSP Mohd Dun Banir having the most number of evacuees, totalling 231 victims,” it ​​said.  It also said the flood in Beaufort affected 75 villages and 47 villages in Tenom.  Meanwhile, the flood in the northern part of Sarawak has slightly improved with some of the 233 people, involving 70 families, who were evacuated as of  yesterday afternoon, having returned home, leaving only 145 people from 42 families still at the relief centres at 8 am today."

other,"Turning to monetary policy, let me emphasize that I expect a great deal of continuity in the FOMC's approach to monetary policy. I served on the Committee as we formulated our current policy strategy and I strongly support that strategy, which is designed to fulfill the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate of maximum employment and price stability.Prior to the financial crisis, the FOMC carried out monetary policy by adjusting its target for the federal funds rate. With that rate near zero since late 2008, we have relied on two less-traditional tools--asset purchases and forward guidance--to help the economy move toward maximum employment and price stability. Both tools put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and support asset prices. In turn, these more accommodative financial conditions support consumer spending, business investment, and housing construction, adding impetus to the recovery.Our current program of asset purchases began in September 2012 amid signs that the recovery was weakening and progress in the labor market had slowed. The Committee said that it would continue the program until there was a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in a context of price stability. In mid-2013, the Committee indicated that if progress toward its objectives continued as expected, a moderation in the monthly pace of purchases would likely become appropriate later in the year. In December, the Committee judged that the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions warranted a modest reduction in the pace of purchases, from $45 billion to $40 billion per month of longer-term Treasury securities and from $40 billion to $35 billion per month of agency mortgage-backed securities. At its January meeting, the Committee decided to make additional reductions of the same magnitude. If incoming information broadly supports the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings. That said, purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on its outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.The Committee has emphasized that a highly accommodative policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after asset purchases end. In addition, the Committee has said since December 2012 that it expects the current low target range for the federal funds rate to be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above our 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. Crossing one of these thresholds will not automatically prompt an increase in the federal funds rate, but will instead indicate only that it had become appropriate for the Committee to consider whether the broader economic outlook would justify such an increase. In December of last year and again this January, the Committee said that its current expectation--based on its assessment of a broad range of measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments--is that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6-1/2 percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the 2 percent goal. I am committed to achieving both parts of our dual mandate: helping the economy return to full employment and returning inflation to 2 percent while ensuring that it does not run persistently above or below that level."
drought,"As Ethiopia emerges from the worst drought in decades, you'll have to look very hard to find the expected results of severe drought: emaciated children, skin-and-bones cattle, malnourished nursing mothers desperate for food, skeletal elders hovering in doorways.
Unlike the horrifying images that garnered world attention during Ethiopia's infamous drought from 1983 to 1985, most of the 10 million people directly affected by the current drought don't look like they are on the brink of starvation for one simple reason: They aren't.
""We have avoided a major catastrophe because of major accomplishments that Ethiopia has been able to do,"" said Choice Okoro, the head of the Strategic Communications Unit for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Ethiopia. ""These national systems are behind Ethiopia's success -- these are the backbones of the response of the current drought,"" Okoro said, crediting government programs for the free flow of international aid.
The drought has affected most of the country, imperiling crops in six of the country's eight administrative regions, in addition to other countries such as Zimbabwe, South Africa, Sudan and South Sudan, and some parts of Kenya and Uganda.
The Catholic church is deeply involved with drought relief in Ethiopia and across Africa, although Catholics make up less than 1 percent of Ethiopia's population.
In December 2015, the government, in cooperation with international aid agencies like the United Nations and Catholic Relief Services, estimated that more than 10 million people, 10 percent of the population, were in need of food assistance, and 400,000 children were severely malnourished. The cost of providing immediate drought relief, they said, is $1.2 billion, revised to $1.4 billion in May.
Catholic Relief Services is at the head of a conglomerate of international aid organizations providing food to 2.8 million people, about a quarter of the people affected by the drought. The Catholic Near East Welfare Agency is providing drought assistance to about 8,000 people."
other,"Growth of Australia's major trading partners over the past year has been a little above its historical average. In the June quarter, the pace of growth looks to have eased a little with a decline in Japan's output following the increase in the consumption tax in April. At the same time, however, growth of Chinese economic activity has picked up, driven by a rebound in exports and a pick-up in investment. This improvement in economic conditions reflects, in part, the modest stimulus provided by the Chinese authorities, which is designed to achieve their target of 7.5 per cent GDP growth in 2014. The US economy grew strongly in the June quarter (after adverse weather contributed to weakness earlier in the year) and the gradual recovery of economic activity in the euro area appears to be continuing. Inflation remains low in most countries, but has picked up in Japan and has shown some signs of lifting in the United States and in parts of Asia. Globally, financial conditions remain very accommodative.Australia's trading partner growth is forecast to be a little above its long-run average in 2014 and 2015. The slight strengthening in growth compared with recent years reflects the expectation of stronger growth in the advanced economies as well as the growing share of Australian exports destined for China, an economy that is growing much faster than Australia's other trading partners. In China, GDP growth is expected to be close to the authorities' target in 2014 and then slow gradually thereafter. In Japan, abstracting from the volatility through the year induced by the consumption tax increase, growth is expected to be a bit above the average of the past decade in 2014, but then ease a little next year. Growth in the rest of east Asia is expected to strengthen a little in 2015, aided by continued recovery in the advanced economies."
earthquake,"An unusual swarm of temblors in southern Colorado accompanied the state’s strongest earthquake in more than 40 years, shaking bricks and stones loose from buildings and rattling some residents.
“The whole house shook, the bookshelves, the paintings,” said Melissa Mestas, a barista at the What’a Grind Coffee House in Trinidad. “It was really scary and just this helpless feeling.”
The 5.3-magnitude earthquake hit Monday shortly before midnight about 9 miles southwest of Trinidad. Throughout the night and into Tuesday morning, aftershocks — several measuring at a magnitude of 3 or above — continued to unsettle residents. No injuries were reported.
Tuesday morning, the conversation at the coffee house centered on where everybody was when the earthquake hit, Mestas said. Along with the coffee house, several older historical buildings in Trinidad’s downtown had minor damage.
The longtime resident said she is familiar with smaller earthquakes but has never been through one as powerful as Monday night’s.
“It’s piqued a lot of curiosity as to what’s caused this,” Mestas said."
wildfires,"The number of fires in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest jumped 28% in July from a year ago, official data showed on Saturday, as some environmentalists warned a jump this week could signal a repeat of last year’s surging destruction of the world’s largest rainforest.
Brazil’s space research agency Inpe recorded 6,803 fires in the Amazon last month, up from 5,318 in July 2019.
Although that is a three-year high for July, the figure pales in comparison to last year’s peak of 30,900 fires in August _ a nine-year high for that month.
Still, environmental groups say there are worrying signs of what may come, with the final days of the month showing a sharp spike. More than 1,000 fires were registered on July 30, the highest number for a single day in July since 2005, according to an analysis by advocacy group Greenpeace Brasil.
“It’s a terrible sign,” said Ane Alencar, science director at Brazil’s Amazon Environmental Research Institute (IPAM). “We can expect that August will already be a difficult month and September will be worse yet.”Environmental advocates blame right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro for emboldening illegal loggers, miners and land speculators to destroy the forest with his vision of economic development for the region. Bolsonaro defends his plans to introduce mining and farming in protected reserves as a way to lift the region out of poverty.
This year, the president authorized a military deployment from May to November to combat deforestation and forest fires. He has also banned setting fires in the region for 120 days.
In 2019, Brazil instituted the same temporary policies later in the year, only after fires in the Amazon provoked global outcry in August.
Scientists say the rainforest is a vital defense against climate warming because it absorbs greenhouse gases.
Non-government organization Amazon Conservation says it has tracked 62 major fires for the year as of July 30. Many of those came after July 15, when the fire ban went into affect, indicating it has not been entirely effective, said Matt Finer, who leads the NGO’s fire tracking project.
The overwhelming majority of large fires, where elevated levels of aerosols in the smoke indicate large amounts of burning biomass, happened in recently deforested areas, with none found in virgin forest, Finer said."
other,"In recent months, growth in Australia's major trading partners appears to have remained at around its long-term average rate. The pace of growth in China has increased a little through the year and is consistent with the Chinese Government's target of 7_ per cent. The expansion in activity has been driven by domestic demand. In Japan, following the adoption of more expansionary fiscal and monetary policies late last year, the economy looks to have picked up further in the second half of this year. In the rest of east Asia, growth has continued at around its decade-average pace, while conditions remain fairly subdued in India. The US economy appears to have been growing at a moderate pace; the partial shutdown of the US federal government in the first half of October is expected to have had only a minor effect on activity. The economy in the euro area remains weak but has shown some signs of improvement. Globally, inflation pressures are contained and monetary conditions remain highly accommodative in most economies.Overall, the outlook for the global economy is much as it was a few months ago and so the forecast for growth in Australia's major trading partners in both 2013 and 2014 is little changed from the August Statement. Trading partner growth in 2013 is expected to be slightly below its longer-run average, reflecting a short period of slower growth around the beginning of the year. Growth in 2014 is expected to be a little above average. The prospect of a pick-up in conditions in many advanced economies is likely to see growth for the world as a whole improve from a below-average pace in 2013 to around average in 2014."

earthquake,"Turkey earthquake: Scores rescued from collapsed buildings, many still trapped More than 40 people have been pulled to safety after spending hours trapped under collapsed buildings following Friday's earthquake. Hopes are fading for dozens of others still imprisoned under concrete ruins. Emergency services in the eastern Turkish city of Elazig continued efforts on Sunday to rescue residents from collapsed buildings after a 6.8 magnitude earthquake shook the region and left at least 38 people dead. A total of 45 people had been pulled alive from under the rubble, officials said. But hopes of finding more survivors are fading as rescue teams struggle to comb through debris in freezing temperatures. Many people in Elazig province and nearby Malatya spent several hours, and some of them days, under piles of rubble before rescue crews were able to reach them. A 35-year-old woman named Ayse Yildiz was trapped for 28 hours under her apartment building in Elazig with her 2-year-old daughter, Yusra. According to Turkish media, rescue workers pulled the young girl from the wreckage at around 8:30 p.m. local time (1730 UTC) on Saturday, but it took nearly five more hours to rescue Yildiz, whose arm was trapped under a pile of rubble."
wildfires,"Towns on the devastated Tasman Peninsula in the state's south-east are cut off and only accessible via sea.
Meanwhile, a fire emergency warning has been issued between Inala Road at Forcett and the Tasman Peninsula.
The Tasmania Fire Service (TFS) says the out-of-control blaze has spread south of Murdunna and has active fire edges back to Forcett and Dodges Ferry.
The service says Taranna is currently being affected by the fire and it is too late for residents to leave the town.
It is understood a number of properties near Eaglehawk Neck have been lost.
The peninsula remains cut off with the Arthur Highway closed until further notice.
Phil Douglas from the TFS says people need to keep off the highway near the Forcett and Nubeena areas.
""There is a strong potential for trees and power lines to fall across those roads at any time without any warming,"" he said.
An emergency warning has also been issued for the Bicheno area in the state's east, where a 4,000-hectare fire is burning out of control.
Firefighters warned the communities of Friendly Beaches and Bicheno may be affected by smoke, embers and ash.
They said Coles Bay Road, south of the Apsley River, and the Tasman Highway, south of Tower Hill, were at very high fire risk.
Coles Bay Road has been closed in both directions, cutting road access to Coles Bay on the Freycinet Peninsula.
The TFS says it is likely too late for residents to leave the affected area, with residents urged to activate their bushfire plans and defend their homes or leave, but only if the path is clear.
There is a community fire refuge for Bicheno residents at Bicheno Community Hall and another for Coles Bay and Swanwick residents at the Swansea Football Ground."
earthquake,"Powerful earthquake strikes between Jamaica and Cuba A magnitude 7.7 earthquake occurred between Cuba and Jamaica on Tuesday afternoon. The epicenter was located in the Caribbean Sea about 83 miles north of Montego Bay, the capital of St. James, and about 87 miles south of Granma, Cuba, according to the United States Geological Survey service. It was a relatively strong but shallow quake with a depth of about 6 miles. A 7.7 magnitude earthquake is at the high end of the Richter Scale. It was initially reported at 7.3 but was quickly revised up to 7.7. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damages. Residents as far as Miami said they felt tremors from the powerful quake. Robert Lee, who was working on the 25th floor of the Miami Tower in Downtown Miami at the time, said he could feel the building ""swaying back and forth."" ""It was crazy! I looked up and saw a light fixture swaying and I got out,"" Lee told ABC News. He said there were easily hundreds of people outside at one point."
wildfires,"A firework at a gender reveal party triggered a wildfire in southern California that has destroyed 7,000 acres (2,800 hectares) and forced many residents to flee their homes, the fire department said Sunday.
More than 500 firefighters and four helicopters were battling the El Dorado blaze east of San Bernardino, which started Saturday morning, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said.
Residents of several communities in the area have been ordered to evacuate.
""CAL FIRE Law Enforcement has determined the El Dorado Fire, burning near Oak Glen in San Bernardino County, was caused by a smoke generating pyrotechnic device, used during a gender reveal party,"" Cal Fire said on Twitter.
""Those responsible for starting fires due to negligence or illegal activity can be held financially and criminally responsible,"" it warned.
Gender reveal parties are held during pregnancy to unveil the sex of the expected child, sometimes announced by pink or blue smoke fireworks.
California has been baking under scorching conditions with temperatures reaching a record 121 degrees Fahrenheit (49 Celsius) on Sunday in Woodland Hills, an all-time high for Los Angeles county, the National Weather Service said.
With the hot and dry conditions, California has suffered a particularly busy fire season this year, with more than 1.6 million acres destroyed so far, including in three of the biggest blazes in the state's history.
In northern California, more than 200 people were airlifted to safety over the weekend after a fast-moving wildfire trapped them near the Mammoth Pool Reservoir northeast of Fresno.
They were rescued by military helicopters, with dozens packed into a Chinook, a photograph posted by the California National Guard showed.
The Creek Fire, which started on Friday in steep and rugged terrain, has so far spread to 73,000 acres, according to the US Forest Service, making it one of the largest. More than 800 firefighters were battling the blaze.
Another rapidly-spreading fire near San Diego, Valley Fire, has so far spread to 10,000 acres and destroyed 11 structures, Cal Fire said.
California governor Gavin Newsom on Sunday declared a state of emergency for five counties affected by the Creek, El Dorado and Valley fires.
""The fires have burned tens of thousands of acres, destroyed homes and caused the evacuation of thousands of residents,"" the governor's office said.
Record temperatures over the three-day Labor Day weekend have aggravated already dangerous fire conditions and further stressed exhausted California firefighters."
Typhoon,"Gonzalo a hurricane risk to Caribbean (maybe US), Hanna a rainfall risk to Texas Two tropical storms, Gonzalo and Hanna, each of which has broken records as the earliest seventh and eighth named storms to form of the Atlantic tropical storm and hurricane season, are threatening impacts in the coming days. The 2020 Atlantic hurricane season is following true to forecasts for a very active season in terms of number of storms, as it is currently running ahead of records. Of course, these forecasts for high levels of activity do not necessarily mean high levels of insurance and reinsurance market losses, as it is landfalls that matter, in highly urbanised locations by strong storms and hurricanes. Tropical storm Gonzalo is forecast to become hurricane Gonzalo in the coming day or so, as it tracks towards the southern Caribbean windward islands. Gonzalo was the earliest seventh named storm of a tropical season and is now heading for the Caribbean with sustained winds of over 60mph and higher gusts. Expected to reach hurricane status, Gonzalo could then weaken slightly and head into the eastern Caribbean Sea, before then regaining strength on its passage northwest. Gonzalo is a relatively small tropical storm, with tropical-storm-force winds only extending outward up to 25 miles from the centre, which should save some islands from as strong a hit as it passes. Once through the Caribbean Gonzalo could enter the Gulf of Mexico and while there is significant uncertainty in precisely where the storm will track to, a U.S. Gulf Coast landfall is in the forecast for certain model runs. The below is taken from TropicalTidbits.com and shows a GFS model run for storm Gonzalo."

Typhoon,"An ominous tweet appeared on a historic North Carolina community’s Twitter feed about 2 a.m. Friday.
It came as rivers swelled, tides crested and the rain wouldn’t stop. And that’s when people found themselves trapped in their homes as the water rose.
“WE ARE COMING TO GET YOU,” the tweet said. “You may need to move up to the second story, or to your attic, but WE ARE COMING TO GET YOU.”
More than 360 people had been rescued by midafternoon Friday, hours after then-Hurricane Florence swept through, but another 140 were still waiting for help, city spokeswoman Colleen Roberts told The Associated Press.
Crews from the city and the Federal Emergency Management Agency were working with citizen volunteers to get people to dry ground, Roberts said. There had been no reports of injuries or fatalities, though most of the city was without power and thousands of buildings had been damaged, she said.
Sixty-seven-year-old Sadie Marie Holt was among those rescued Friday.
Holt, who has diabetes and clogged arteries, said she stayed for doctor’s appointments that were canceled at the last minute. She tried to row out of her neighborhood Thursday night with a boat that was in her yard after her home began to flood, but had to retreat because of the poor conditions."

The typhoon made landfall Thursday near Haikou, in China’s Hainan Province, with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph. Nesat earlier struck the Philippines, where Oakland, Calif.-based EQECAT estimated insured damages at less than $100 million.
EQECAT noted that Hainan is primarily an agrarian province, and that insurance penetration as a whole in China is below 20%, depending on region and economic development.
“Low levels of damage combined with low insurance penetration produce an expectation that losses from the catastrophe will remain below $50 million,” EQECAT said in an analysis released Friday."

Winds of up to 150 kilometers (93 miles) per hour killed a man by knocking him off his roof as he was trying to reinforce it in south-central Quang Ngai province. Another man was pinned to death by a fallen tree in the coastal province, the official Vietnam News Agency reported.
The navy deployed two rescue boats to search for the 26 fishermen off Binh Dinh province, according to state-run VTV network. It was not immediately clear if anyone was saved in the storm-tossed waters."
wildfires,"Wildfires can cause overwhelming stress: The red-orange hues beyond the plumes of smoke seemed so far away, but now threaten the only place some have ever called home. Communities of people told they're not in danger one moment are put on high alert the next. There's not always time to grab family photos, your grandmother's ring or your beloved pets. It only takes a few minutes for fires to grow at an incomprehensible velocity, forcing people out of their homes, says Scott Vest, spokesman for the Red Cross' Ogden, Utah, Northern Chapter. He was stationed in Middletown, California, which is about two hours north of San Francisco, for about two weeks _ just days after emergency officials announced on Sept. 15 that 23,000 people had been displaced by wildfires in Northern California this year. More than 300,000 acres have burned in California so far in 2015, and the fires continue.
“When everything has been destroyed and all you have is a pile of ashes, you don’t really have anything to hold on to,” Vest says.
The notion that there's a specific wildfire season is a thing of the past, says Merritt Schreiber, an associate professor of clinical emergency medicine and director of psychological programs at the Center for Disaster Medical Sciences at the University of California—Irvine Medical Center and School of Medicine_. ""The last few years, fire season has become all year long. It's seriously aggravated by the drought, and the drought is a big stressor in the area,"" says Schreiber, who's also director for pediatric trauma psychology consultation services _there.
When Distress Gets Serious
Grant Marshall, a senior behavioral scientist at the RAND Corporation in Santa Monica, California, has focused his research on trauma resulting from wildfires and other disasters. In August, he and other researchers published a study in EcoHealth that examined the psychological distress faced by 1,387 of the 6,000 households displaced by wildfires that burned 733 square miles in Apache County, Arizona, from May through June 2011.
""We found relatively high rates _ 35 percent _ of people who were still experiencing emotional distress that could be indicative of a mental health problem even months after the event took place,"" Marshall says.
Those experiencing such an event might feel more irritable, nervous or anxious or even depressed, Vest says._ They might have detailed memories of the evacuation or witnessing the fire raging toward their community.
Schreiber adds there are two trajectories people tend to take when they've experienced a wildfire or similar disaster that displaces them: distress with resilience and distress without resilience.
""Many people have distress, and many people who have distress are going to have resilience. They're going to bounce back to how they were doing before in a relatively short period of time,"" Schreiber explains, adding that the other group who can't seem to deal may have a greater risk for developing a condition such as _depression or post-traumatic stress disorder.
How a person responds may depend on whether he or she had a chance to prepare to evacuate their home, whether the evacuation was during daylight or in the middle of the night and if there was an opportunity to collect belongings and pets."

The earthquake occurred at a shallow depth of 10 km beneath the epicenter early morning on Tuesday 12 January 2021 at 5:33 am local time. The exact magnitude, epicenter, and depth of the quake might be revised within the next few hours or minutes as seismologists review data and refine their calculations, or as other agencies issue their report. A second report was later issued by the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC), which listed it as a magnitude 6.2 earthquake. Based on the preliminary seismic data, the quake should have been widely felt by almost everyone in the area of the epicenter. It might have caused light to moderate damage. Moderate shaking probably occurred in Turt (pop. 2,100) located 34 km from the epicenter. VolcanoDiscovery will automatically update magnitude and depth if these change and follow up if other significant news about the quake become available.

Four people have died and dozens have been taken to hospital. An investigation has been launched to determine if some of the fires were a result of arson.
During a visit to Manavgat, Turkey's Agriculture Minister Bekir Pakdemirli, said bringing the fires under control might take time."
other,"Nicaragua's crackdown on opposition leaders and activists ahead of elections this fall shows no sign of ending, with police detaining yet another leading figure -- lawyer Roger Reyes -- on Friday.
Reyes, a member of the Political Council of the opposition Blue and White National Unit (UNAB), was given a 90-day judicial detention, according to a statement by the country's Public Ministry on Monday.
By CNN's tally, he is the 34th opposition figure to be arrested since May 28, ahead of the November 7 elections in which President Daniel Ortega plans to run for re-election.
Reyes, according to the ministry, is being investigated by the police for allegedly attacking ""Nicaraguan society and the rights of the people in accordance with Law 1055 and the Penal Code.
The statement claims that Reyes has engaged in ""acts that undermine the sovereignty, independence and self-determination of Nicaragua"" and that he has ""celebrated the imposition of sanctions against the State of Nicaragua and its citizens.""
UNAB posted on its Twitter account that Reyes had been arrested on Friday night by the National Police. ""So far his whereabouts are unknown. We demand that his physical integrity and those of more than 140 political prisoners be respected,"" said the opposition alliance.
The group told CNN that Reyes already has a defense attorney, but would not give their name, citing security reasons.
The Blue and White Unit shared a video that Reyes recorded in mid-June where he anticipates his arrest. In the video, he calls for the country's social and political sectors to unite against the Daniel Ortega government.
Many opposition leaders and activists detained in recent months are being investigated for alleged actions against national sovereignty or alleged money laundering -- claims that they, their relatives and lawyers have broadly rejected."
other,"The economic expansion in the United States became increasingly well established in the first half of 2004, but the pace of inflation picked up from its very low rate in 2003. At the time of the February Monetary Policy Report to the Congress, considerable evidence was already in hand indicating that the U.S. economy had made the transition from a period of subpar growth to one of more-vigorous expansion. Nevertheless, job creation remained limited, and gains in investment, although sizable, still seemed restrained by a lingering caution on the part of some businesses. In the event, businesses stepped up their hiring in the spring, and capital spending seems to have continued apace."
valcano eruption,"Guatemala volcano alert too late to save lives, officials admit EL RODEO, Guatemala (Reuters) - A communication breakdown between a disaster agency and volcanologists in Guatemala delayed evacuations as gas and ash clouds cascaded down the Fuego volcano last Sunday in its most violent eruption in four decades, authorities have admitted. Compounding the situation, rain and clouds hid signs of the toxic shower of debris, known as a pyroclastic flow, hurtling down the mountainside, hindering visual observation. The scalding material that poured out of Fuego, which means “Fire” in Spanish, has killed 100 people, with more than 190 missing, authorities say, as rescue work on Thursday was suspended as it was too dangerous for the workers."
valcano eruption,"DR Congo volcanic eruption damages crops in Rwanda's Rubavu District Lava from Nyiragongo eruption damaged between three and five hectares of crops in Cyanzarwe Sector of Rubavu District in western Rwanda. The volcanic eruption in eastern DR Congo, which happened on Saturday, May 22, also had other implications in Rwanda where it triggered a wave of earthquakes—which damaged houses and road in Rubavu. The New Times has established that the flowing lava crossed into Rwanda and destroyed people’s crops."
Typhoon,"The turbulent Atlantic hurricane season passed a grim new milestone as Subtropical Storm Theta formed on Monday night.
The arrival of Theta means that 2020 has now broken the record for the number of storms strong enough to be given names in a single season.
Theta is the 29th named storm of the hurricane season, and meteorologists say another could strike the Caribbean in the coming days.
So far, a dozen storms have made landfall in the US this year. Storms have also caused severe damage across Central American and Caribbean countries including Belize, Bermuda, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua and Panama."
other,"Peloton is cutting the price of its original at-home exercise bike for the second time in a year, a sign that the trendy fitness company is facing fiercer competition from rivals producing significantly cheaper products and people returning to gyms.
Beginning Thursday, its core bike will cost $1,495 — a roughly 20% reduction — with the monthly financing rate dropping $10 to $39 a month. Peloton said in a press release that the price cut is part of its mission to making the company's products ""more accessible and attainable.""
Peloton also announced new financing terms for its recently released Tread and pricier Bike+ with the monthly prices dropping by several dollars and the company offering 0% APR. Peloton (PTON) previously cut the price of the Bike by 15% to $1,895 in September 2020.
Peloton CEO John Foley recently said that the price cuts and introduction of cheaper machines, such as the Tread, is aimed at attracting new members that might think it's just for the wealthy. The company is also growing its app membership base, which feature workouts that don't need Peloton machines, with price reductions for qualified people and star-studded classes.
Peloton stock dropped 15% after hours Thursday and shares of the company are down about 20% this year. Investors have soured on the company in light of the massive recall surrounding its treadmill and delivery delays. The company also posted disappointing earnings and an underwhelming outlook."
valcano eruption,"Volcano erupts near Congolese city of Goma; residents flee GOMA _ Congo’s Mount Nyiragongo erupted for the first time in nearly two decades Saturday, turning the night sky a fiery red and sending lava onto a major highway as panicked residents tried to flee Goma, a city of nearly 2 million. There was no immediate word on any casualties, but witnesses said that lava already had engulfed one highway that connects Goma with the city of Beni in North Kivu province. Mount Nyiragongo’s last eruption, in 2002, left hundreds dead and coated airport runways in lava. More than 100,000 people were left homeless in the aftermath, adding to the fear in Goma on Saturday night."
drought,"The drought situation in the Yucatan Peninsula in 2020 is shaping up to be worst in the past 34 years. Three years of below-average rainfall are merging, and groundwater levels are already pummeling to minimum levels, making this year's drought projections similar to major droughts that occurred in 1986 and 1962.
Aside from the devastating consequences of a dry period including extraction of water for agricultural use and human consumption, wildfires are also at high risk, with some of it already started.
February to May is Yucatan's dry season-- the time when farmers traditionally burn and clear fields for crops. However, the situation is also an urban crisis.
""The theory of climate change tells us that extraordinary meteorological events will occur in large urban spots,"" said meteorologist Juan Vasquez Montalvo from the Autonomous University of Yucatan (UADY) Meteorological Center. ""Therefore, Merida will be the city where the hot environment and high temperatures throughout the southeast of Mexico will suffer the most.""
""Everything indicates that the 2020 dry season will be the strongest since 1986,"" Montalvo said, adding that the situation is of utmost significance, considering that this year's dry spell ties in with that of 2019 and a part of 2018 when the rainfall was less than average.
Three years of below-average rainfall are merging, and groundwater levels are already pummeling to minimum levels.
The meteorologist, however, said the cause is still unknown. ""What is causing it? We don't know. The explanation may be a cycle that is repeating itself because the atmosphere lives cycles.""
""It could be the dry, descending air that is dominating and the high pressures that came this year-long before time, arriving at the end of January, when they normally do so in late March or early April, and these conditions have brought the drought ahead of time,"" he added.
Montalvo also enumerated signs that the worst of the situation is coming. First, the Maculis trees bloomed in February, instead of in March as what is usual. Also, the Ceiba trees bore fruit prematurely. Moreover, ants have been bringing food to their nests, which is ""an omen that a very severe drought is coming, and they are stocking up,"" he stated."
earthquake,"A severe 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck off the east of New Zealand's North Island on Friday, prompting a tsunami warning, and authorities advised people in some coastal areas to move immediately to high ground.
There were no immediate reports of damage, but the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) said there was land and marine threat in some areas of the east coast of North Island.
""Coastal inundation (flooding of land areas) is expected in areas under Land and Marine threat,"" NEMA said in a tweet.
The closest major city to the epicentre is Gisborne with a population of about 35,500. People near the coast from Cape Runaway to Tolaga Bay were told to evacuate.
Authorities said the first waves may have already reached areas around East Cape from Cape Runaway to Tolaga Bay at about 3:34 a.m. local time.
They said tsunami activity will continue for several hours and the threat must be regarded as real until the warning is cancelled.
""Hope everyone is ok out there - especially on the East Coast who would have felt the full force of that earthquake,"" Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern posted on Instagram.
There was no tsunami threat to the capital Wellington and other regions, but civil defence authorities asked residents across the country to stay away from beaches and marine areas as there could be strong and unusual currents.
The New Zealand government's seismic monitor Geonet pegged the quake at a magnitude of 7.2 with a depth of 94 km (58 miles).
More than 60,000 people reported feeling the quake on GeoNet's website, with 282 describing the shaking as ""severe"" and 75 saying it was ""extreme"". Most others described it as light.
Aftershocks were still being recorded in the area."
valcano eruption,"Japanese Red Cross medical teams join rescue efforts following Mount Ontake volcanic eruption At least 31 people are known to have perished following the unexpected volcanic eruption of Japan’s Mount Ontake on Saturday. The bodies of the dead were found by rescue teams from the police and fire departments who reached the peak yesterday afternoon in their search for survivors. Over 250 hikers were at the peak when the volcano which lies about 130 miles west of Tokyo, began spewing rocks, ash and thick smoke. Most managed to find their way to safety but 45 remained missing. The Japanese Red Cross immediately dispatched seven Disaster Medical Assistance Teams (DMAT) to the area to care for survivors. They also distributed over 400 blankets and 35 sleeping kits to hikers coming off the mountain."
wildfires,"Dozens of wildfires raging in rain-starved Texas are now reported to have engulfed more than 1,000 homes.
The biggest of the blazes - 16 miles (26km) wide - in rural Bastrop County, is burning out of control for a third day, having destroyed 600 homes.
Two people were reported to have died in the Bastrop blaze, a local sheriff said, amid hopes for calmer winds to help control the fires.
Texas has been suffering its worst drought since the 1950s.
Schools closed
Speaking at a news conference on Tuesday, Texas Governor Rick Perry said more than 100,000 acres (40,470ha) had been scorched by at least 57 wildfires in Texas over the past week.
More than 1,000 homes had been burned over the past week, added Texas emergency management chief Nim Kidd.
On Monday, officials said about 500 homes had been destroyed."
flood,"Flash floods, towns evacuated and dams on the brink of spilling over as wild weather slams NSW A rain bomb is slowly pushing down the NSW coastline, leaving a trail of flash floods and destruction in its wake. Multiple warnings and evacuation orders are still in place for the NSW mid-north coast amid fears of record flood levels and overflowing levees, with authorities warning the situation could be life-threatening. Sydney is next in line with some areas predicted to cop more than 150 millimetres of rain on Saturday."

CARE staff and partners on the ground report that many areas remain isolated with people unable to receive support for days due to damaged highways and roads."
wildfires,"Fanned by strong winds, two new big wildfires erupted Monday in hard-hit Greece, triggering evacuation alerts for villages southeast and northwest of Athens — only days after blazes consumed large tracts of forest north of the Greek capital.
No injuries have been reported but Greek media said a few buildings had been damaged.
Greece has been roiled by hundreds of wildfires this month, on the heels of its most severe heat wave in decades, which left its forests tinder dry. Other Mediterranean countries — Turkey, Italy, Algeria and Spain among them — have suffered similar problems.
Scientists say there is little doubt that climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas is driving more extreme weather events.
Monday's first blaze in Greece broke out in the morning in the Keratea region southeast of Athens, burned shrubland and threatened a national park in the Sounion area. Three communities were ordered evacuated. Some residents desperately drenched their homes, while volunteers with hoses and branches helped fight the fires. More than 100 firefighters, eight water-dropping planes and 11 helicopters were striving to contain the blaze, which appeared to be on the wane by evening.
Local mayor Dimitris Loukas told Greek television that authorities were investigating reports of arson. He said residents had seen someone in a car setting a dumpster on fire.
On the other side of the capital, to the northwest, another blaze broke out Monday in the Vilia area, triggering an evacuation alert for eight other villages. Strong winds hampered the firefighting effort, with flames threatening to spread onto a nearby wooded mountain.
That blaze was being fought by 240 firefighters — including 143 from Poland — supported by eight water-dropping planes and nine helicopters.
The fire service said 45 wildfires erupted across the country between late Sunday and late Monday. Most were quickly contained.
Two major fires in Greece that began in early August, one on the island of Evia and another in a national park north of Athens, were still smoldering Monday, and firefighters were trying to secure their perimeters. On Evia, water-bombing planes were deployed again Monday to assist ground forces.
On Monday, Greece's civil protection chief, Nikos Hardalias, who coordinates the fight against wildfires as well as the country's response to the coronavirus pandemic, was taken to an Athens hospital where he underwent unscheduled heart surgery. A health ministry statement said the operation was successful.
Weeks of wildfires have stretched Greece’s response capabilities to the limit. About 24 European and Mideast countries sent ground crews, aircraft and vehicles to help. Most have left, although 40 Austrian firefighters remained in the southern Peloponnese region, where two major fires have been burning for days.
Several other Mediterranean countries have suffered intense heat and quickly spreading wildfires in recent weeks, including Algeria, where wildfires killed at least 75 people; Turkey, where at least 16 people have died during wildfires and Italy, which saw several fire-related deaths.
Worsening drought and heat have also fueled wildfires this summer in the western United States and in Russia’s northern Siberia region."
other,"The Australian economy has continued to record a strong performance during 2000. While many of the economic statistics have been affected by the impact of unusual events, such as the introduction of the new tax system, and the Olympic Games, the underlying rate of growth of GDP still appears to have been over 4 per cent. This has been associated with fast growth in employment over much of the year, and a significant further decline in the unemployment rate.Conditions have been particularly favourable for Australian exporters, with world economic growth at its strongest for a decade. This strength owes a good deal to the acceleration in the US economy during the first half of the year, but stronger performances in Europe, east Asia and Japan have also contributed. Most commodity prices have firmed in foreign currency terms and, along with the depreciation in the Australian dollar, have contributed to the value of exports rising by 25 per cent over the past year (abstracting from the recording of Olympic effects in the month of September)."
other,"The U.S. economy weakened markedly in the second half of 2008 as the turmoil in financial markets intensified, credit conditions tightened further, and asset values continued to slump. Conditions in the labor market worsened significantly after early autumn, and nearly all major sectors of the economy registered steep declines in activity late last year. Meanwhile, inflation pressures diminished appreciably as prices of energy and other commodities dropped sharply, the margin of resource slack in the economy widened, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar strengthened."
flood,"Sri Lanka floods death toll rises to 17 COLOMBO: Army relief workers in aluminum dinghies handed out rice and other food to residents in submerged parts of the Sri Lankan capital as the death toll from monsoon floods across the country rose to 17 on Monday.  The monsoon hits the South Asian country twice a year, bringing vital rain for irrigation and hydro-power generation but it can be deadly and destructive. At least 17 people have died since Friday after heavy downpours inundated 10 of the country's 25 districts.  ""Our kitchen is still flooded and we managed, thanks to cooked food distributed by the military,"" Kusuma Dahanayake told Agence France-Presse (AFP) by telephone from Gampaha, the worst-affected district, just outside Colombo.  The 73-year-old said it was the worst flooding she had experienced at her home since she moved there in 1995. Officials said floodwaters in the area were receding but about 161,000 people were still unable to return to their homes.  poster The flooding in the area was exacerbated by the illegal filling of low-lying lands reserved for stormwater retention, they added.  Residents of Kelaniya, on the outskirts of Colombo, waded through waist-deep waters while some used makeshift rafts and oars to get around on streets, which now resembled canals.  In Malwana, just northeast of Colombo, Hassen Maulavi told AFP he had to negotiate flooded streets for an urgent medical appointment on Monday from his partially submerged two-story home."
Typhoon,"At least 13 people were killed and over 50 missing, with nearly 20,000 people ordered to evacuate and hundreds of flights cancelled as Typhoon Wipha pummelled Japan’s Pacific coast on Wednesday, leaving piles of wreckage on one small island but largely sparing the capital Tokyo.
Operators of the wrecked Fukushima nuclear power plant north of Tokyo pumped rainwater out of protective containers at the base of some 1,000 tanks storing radioactive water, and were taking other precautions, as the typhoon brushed past Tokyo and moved up the coastline.
Television footage showed roads clogged with heaps of wreckage and houses with gaping holes.
“I heard a crackling sound and then the trees on the hillside all fell over,” a woman on Oshima island told NHK national television. “Then mud slid as far as the house.”
The storm brought hurricane-force winds and drenching rain to the metropolis of 30 million people at the peak of the morning rush hour, halting some train services. Other trains operated at partial capacity.
The storm, which was picking up speed as it moved north, was 170 km (105 miles) south of the city of Miyako and moving north northeast at 75 kph (47 mph) at 11am (0200 GMT), according to the Japan Meteorological Agency’s website.
It carried sustained winds at its centre of 126 kph (78 mph) and gusts up to 180 kph (112 mph) and was expected to weaken into a tropical depression later on Wednesday.
Over 500 flights at Tokyo’s Haneda and Narita airports were cancelled, and several subway lines in the city stopped running due to the high winds. Thousands of schools closed as a precaution.
The typhoon passed close to the crippled Fukushima plant, 220 km (130 miles) north of Tokyo, shortly before noon.
The operator of the plant, Tokyo Electric Power Corp , which has been struggling to contain radioactive leaks, said it would cancel all offshore work and would decide whether to continue work onshore after assessing the weather.
It was pumping out rainwater at the tanks storing radioactive water, a by-product of a jerry-rigged cooling system designed to control reactors wrecked in a 2011 earthquake and tsunami.
The rainwater will be pumped into an empty tank, checked for radioactivity and, if uncontaminated, released into the sea, the company said.
Nissan Motor Co cancelled the Wednesday morning shift at its Oppama and Yokohama plants south of Tokyo and said it was waiting to decide what to do about later shifts. Oppama makes the all-electric Leaf and other models.
Typhoon Wipha is the strongest storm to approach eastern Japan since October 2004. The cyclone that year triggered floods and landslides that killed almost 100 people, forced thousands from their homes and caused billions of dollars in damage."
drought,"alifornia's prehistoric droughts used to last for centuries and even millennia, but new research suggests greenhouse gases might be setting the state up for conditions equally as dire.
Published late last week in the journal Scientific Reports, the study found natural variations in climate – caused by things like sun spots, a decrease in volcanic activity or a small alteration in the planet's orbit – have warmed the region for prolonged periods of time over the last 10,000 years. It's a process known as radiative forcing, and now, greenhouse gases have been added to the list.
""Radiative forcing in the past appears to have had catastrophic effects in extending droughts,"" Glen MacDonald, a UCLA professor who led the study, said in a news release. ""When you have arid periods that persist for 60 years, as we did in the 12th century, or for millennia, as we did from 6,000 to 1,000 B.C., that’s not really a 'drought.' That aridity is the new normal."""
Typhoon,"Earth’s strongest storm of 2013 so far, typhoon Utor, did a number on the northern Philippines.  Now it’s destined for southeastern China.
Utor, referred to as Labuyo in the Philippines, packed maximum sustained winds of 140 mph as it battered the northern island of Luzon.
The storm killed at least two people and destroyed 80 percent of the infrastructure in town of Casiguran near where it came inland according to reports.
In the hours prior to landfall, Utor’s intensity peaked at 150 mph, the equivalent of high-end category 4 hurricane and earning it “super typhoon” status (winds must be 150 mph for “super typhoon” classification), briefly.  That intensity bested any storm globally in 2013 writes Jeff Masters at wunderground.
“Earth’s previous most powerful tropical cyclone of 2013 was Typhoon Soulik, which reached Category 4 strength with 145 mph winds on July 10,” Masters says.
As it passed over Luzon, Utor dumped over 7.5 inches of rain in the cities of Dagupan and and Baguio notes AccuWeather.
The storm weakened markedly as it crossed over Luzon’s mountainous terrain, but is likely to regain some strength as it passes over the South China Sea.  As of 11 a.m., the Joint Typhoon Warning Center says its maximum sustained winds are around 100 mph and it forecasts gradual strengthening over the next two days:"
drought,"California is at the edge of another protracted drought, just a few years after one of the worst dry spells in state history left poor and rural communities without well water, triggered major water restrictions in cities, forced farmers to idle their fields, killed millions of trees, and fueled devastating megafires.
On Thursday, the unofficial end of California’s wet season, officials announced that the accumulation of snow in the Sierra Nevada mountains and the Cascades was about 40% below average levels. The state doesn’t have enough snow and rain banked to replenish its groundwater supplies, feed its rivers and streams or fill depleted reservoirs.
“It’s not just that we’re anticipating a dry year, it’s that this is our second extremely dry year, in a row,” said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California Los Angeles and the Nature Conservancy. California _ along with much of the US west _ is parched, Swain added, and should brace for water cuts and arid conditions that could trigger more destructive wildfires.
Just four years since the state’s last drought emergency, experts and advocates say the state isn’t ready to cope with what could be months and possibly years of drought to come. Heading into the summer, battles are heating up between cities, farms and environmentalists over how scarce supplies are rationed."
drought,"Brazil is experiencing its worst dry spell in 91 years, government agencies warned and declared an ""emergency drought alert"" for June to September as rains are forecast to remain scarce during that period. 
The country’s Electricity Sector Monitoring Committee (CMSE) said that water regulator ANA should recognize a situation of ""water scarcity"" in the Parana River Basin as central and southern Brazil are suffering from the country's worst drought in nearly a century.
""As highlighted by the National Electricity System Operator, in May 2021, significant values ​​of precipitation were not observed, typical behavior of the dry season, a condition that should continue in the coming months, especially in the southeast/midwest region,"" the CMSE said in a statement.
Separately, a weather monitoring agency linked to the Agriculture Ministry issued its first emergency drought alert for five Brazilian states, from June to September.
The lack of rain across much of the country is feared to have negative impacts on livestock, grain cultivation, and electricity generation, as the nation heavily depends on hydro dams for its power.
Scientists also warned that the dry spell could spark more severe fires in the Amazon rainforest and Pantanal wetlands.
On Friday, May 28, the Ministry of Mines and Energy said it has sought to expand the supply of energy in Brazil, but decided on conducting an emergency process for hiring capacity.
""The current situation is challenging. There is no provision for emergency energy contracting,"" it said in a statement, citing lower than normal reservoirs.
Among the worst-hit sectors in Brazil were sugar and coffee production, which led to price hikes for the commodities. The country is the world's largest supplier of the said products."
earthquake,"'It was a pretty good shaker': 7.5 magnitude earthquake in Pacific Ocean prompts short-lived tsunami scare for Alaska, Hawaii A magnitude 7.5 earthquake jolted Alaska's southern coast on Monday afternoon, triggering a tsunami warning for The Last Frontier and a short-lived tsunami advisory nearly 2,500 miles away in Hawaii. The quake struck in the North Pacific Ocean just before 1 p.m., about 67 miles southeast of Sand Point, a town of about 900 people off the Alaskan Peninsula, according to the Alaska Earthquake Center. The tsunami warning was downgraded about two hours later to an advisory that stretched until about 9 p.m. before being canceled. “It was a pretty good shaker here,” said David Adams, co-manager of Marine View Bed and Breakfast in Sand Point. “You could see the water kind of shaking and shimmering during the quake."" A magnitude 5.2 quake was reported 11 minutes later in roughly the same area, according to the earthquake center. Wave levels reached 2 feet along Alaska's southern coast, according to the National Tsunami Warning Center."
other,"The nominal GDP (NGDP) gap, a measure of unexpected changes in the dollar size of the US economy, is the percentage difference between the actual and the neutral levels of NGDP. The neutral level of NGDP, in turn, is a sum of all dollar incomes expected by households and businesses coming into a specific time period. In the second quarter of 2021, the NGDP gap was _0.10 percent, down from the _2.11 percent NGDP gap experienced in the first quarter of 2021 (see figures below).The _0.10 percent NGDP gap means that the dollar size of the economy, $22.722 trillion, was very close to the expected $22.746 trillion. This closing of the NGDP gap implies that aggregate spending and income in dollar terms have largely caught up to their prepandemic trend levels.By way of comparison, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) output gap reveals that the real economy was 1.72 percent smaller than its true potential in the second quarter in 2021 (see table). Also, relative to the previous quarter, actual NGDP grew by 3.11 percent (13.01 percent on annualized basis) over the same period. NGDP growth in the second quarter of 2021 picked up compared to the previous quarter and is a key reason that the NGDP gap is close to zero."

Blue discolorations appeared on their limbs following the incident at Darmstadt Technical University, German police and the public prosecutor in the federal state of Hessen said in a press release Tuesday.
A police spokesman told CNN on Wednesday that six people were hospitalized, one of whom was a 30-year-old student who was initially in a life-threatening condition.
Darmstadt Technical University said in a tweet late Tuesday that all six were feeling better and had now left hospital.
One person did not need medical assistance.
Police found several milk and water containers contaminated with a hazardous substance.
The substance is still unknown and is being examined, police said. They noted the acrid smell of the liquids was particularly striking.
Police said the perpetrator must have had access to the kitchen between Friday 20 and Monday 22 August.
The Police and Steering Committee of Darmstadt University has warned people not to consume any food stored at the Lichtwiese campus where the incident took place.
Buildings at the university campus were searched by police but no other suspicious objects have so far been found.
Police said there was no imminent threat but urged everybody to only consume food they had control of at all times."
flood,"Flood evacuees in Sabah, Sarawak continue to increase The situation in flood-hit areas in Sabah and Sarawak has worsened, with Sabah recording 1,447 evacuees and Sarawak registering 350 as at this morning. Sabah had 332 flood victims while Sarawak recorded 79 as at yesterday evening. The Sabah State Disaster Management Committee, in a statement today, said Tenom was the worst hit district with 1,149 flood victims, followed by Beaufort (294) and Sipitang (four)."
earthquake,"A magnitude-5.0 offshore earthquake occurred in the Caribbean Sea off central Panama at around 01:13 May 1. The epicenter was about 18 km (11 miles) north of Santa Isabel in Colon Province. The tremor occurred at a depth of about 27 km (17 miles), and weak-to-light shaking was probably felt throughout central and eastern regions, including eastern Cocle, Colon, northern Darien, Guna Yala, Panama, and Panama Oeste provinces. There have been no initial reports of damage or casualties as a result of the earthquake. It could take several hours until authorities can conduct comprehensive damage assessments, especially in remote areas. Aftershocks are possible over the coming days.
Officials may temporarily shut down transportation infrastructure in the tremor zone to check for damage. Minor disruptions could occur during shutdowns, but service will likely resume quickly if no damage is found. Utility outages are possible, particularly near the earthquake's epicenter. The event has not prompted any tsunami advisories."
other,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met in December 2017 and February 2018 in accordance with the pre-announced bi-monthly schedule. The MPC voted to keep the policy rate on hold in these meetings, maintaining its neutral stance of the fourth bi-monthly resolution of October 2017. The MPC¡¯s resolutions as well as individual minutes and voting patterns reflected concerns about the changing inflation trajectory _ upside risks to the inflation outlook from food and fuel prices, rising input cost conditions, fiscal slippages, and volatile global financial markets in its December resolution; and increase in HRAs by state governments, crude oil and other commodity prices, revisions to minimum support prices (MSPs) and fiscal slippages in its February resolution. The seasonal moderation in prices of vegetables and fruits, subdued capacity utilisation, and moderate rural real wage growth were seen as mitigating factors.Against this backdrop, the MPC voted in December by a majority of 5-1 to maintain status quo on the policy rate, while continuing with a neutral stance. As in the October meeting, one member voted for a rate cut to support economic activity. In February, the MPC persevered with status quo on the policy rate with a vote of 5-1 and a neutral stance, while reiterating its commitment to keep headline inflation close to 4 per cent on a durable basis. In view of several drivers of inflation firing at the same time and the upper tolerance band of inflation target under threat, one member voted for a 25 basis points (bps) increase in the policy rate to commence the withdrawal of accommodation. These subtle variations in voting patterns reflecting individual members¡¯ views on the current and evolving macroeconomic outlook as well as policy preferences on the weights they assign to deviations of inflation and output from target/ potential are also observed in recent experiences of the MPCs in other countries (Table I.1)."
earthquake,"One of the strongest earthquakes to hit the South Pacific in modern history triggered tsunami warnings across the ocean and forced thousands of people in New Zealand to evacuate coastal areas Friday. Small tsunami waves were seen, but little damage was apparent hours later.
The magnitude 8.1 quake in the Kermadec Islands region about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) from New Zealand was the largest in a series of tremors over several hours, including two earlier quakes that registered magnitude 7.4 and magnitude 7.3.
The tsunami threat caused traffic jams and some chaos in New Zealand as people scrambled to get to higher ground.
Residents recorded videos of small wave surges in some places, including at Tokomaru Bay near Gisborne. In the afternoon, the National Emergency Management Agency said the threat had passed and people could return to their homes, although they should continue avoiding beaches.
One of the earlier quakes hit much closer to New Zealand and awoke many people as they felt a long, rumbling shaking. “Hope everyone is ok out there,” New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern wrote on Facebook during the night."
other,"Amidst the global downturn and continuing stresses in world financial markets, external and domestic inflationary pressures are dissipating.  Meanwhile, the domestic economy is likely to remain below potential till a decisive recovery is seen in Singapore¡¯s export markets.In our assessment, the current level of the S$NEER is appropriate for maintaining domestic price stability over the medium term, taking into account the prospects for growth in the Singapore economy.  MAS will therefore re-centre the exchange rate policy band to the prevailing level of the S$NEER, while keeping the zero percent appreciation path.  The width of the band will remain unchanged.  The Singapore economy continues to be anchored by sound fundamentals and a resilient financial system.  There is therefore no reason for any undue weakening of the Singapore dollar."

Currently, State Governments can avail of Special Drawing Facility (SDF) from the Reserve Bank against the collateral of the funds in CSF and GRF. The rate of interest charged is 100 bps below the Repo Rate at which Ways and Means Advances are extended to the State Governments. In order to further incentivise adequate maintenance of these funds by the State Governments and to encourage them to increase the corpus of these funds, it has been decided to lower the rate of interest on SDF from 100 bps below the Repo Rate to 200 bps below the Repo Rate. A circular in this regard will be issued by June 30, 2018.With the maturing of the retail payments market, it is important that the concentration risk in retail payment systems is minimized from a financial stability perspective. The Reserve Bank plans to encourage more players to participate in and promote pan-India payment platforms so as to give a fillip to innovation and competition in the sector. A policy paper in this regard will be put out for public consultation by September 30, 2018.The Reserve Bank has been sensitive to the challenges faced by the visually challenged in conducting their day to day business with Indian banknotes. While different fora have been consulted from time to time before making any change in the Indian banknotes, the Reserve Bank is of the view that technological progress has opened up new vistas for making Indian banknotes more recognizable for the visually challenged, facilitating their day to day transactions. Accordingly, it has been decided that the Reserve Bank, in consultation with various entities representing the visually challenged, will explore the feasibility of developing a suitable device or mechanism for aiding them in the identification of Indian banknotes. The Reserve Bank will issue necessary guidelines in this regard within six months."
earthquake,"Death toll from Mexican quake rises to 10 as Oaxaca assess damage The area surrounding the popular Huatulco beach resort in the southern state of Oaxaca was hardest hit by the 7.4 magnitude quake, but the temblor was felt as far away as Mexico City. The death toll from a powerful earthquake that struck southern Mexico on Tuesday has risen to 10 people. Authorities confirmed the fatalities on Wednesday as locals began to clear the rubble and assess the damage from the temblor. The area surrounding the popular Huatulco beach resort in the southern state of Oaxaca was hardest hit by the 7.4 magnitude quake, but the shaking could be felt as far away as Mexico City, where tall buildings swayed and thousands of people raced into the streets. Roughly 30 buildings in the capital were damaged and in a northern neighbourhood that was hard hit by a 2017 earthquake, some residents had to evacuate their homes. ""This apartment has always been my home. It's where I was born, where I grew up, where I have all my memories,"" Aura Preisser said while removing her belongings from the building, which was cordoned off by authorities. ""If I lost it, I would lose not only my home, but a large part of my heart."""
other,"In December, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the target for the federal funds rate by _ percentage point to a range of 1/2 to 3/4 percent. The FOMC¡¯s decision reflected realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation. Moreover, the decision to raise the target range was consistent with the Committee¡¯s expectation that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace, labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further, and inflation would rise to the FOMC¡¯s 2 percent objective over the medium term. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. In addition, the Committee anticipates reinvesting principal payments of its securities holdings until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way."
other,"Inflation in Australia picked up over the past year in an environment of limited spare capacity and earlier strong demand. In these circumstances, a significant slowing in the growth of demand from the rapid pace of 2007 will be needed in order to return inflation to the target over time. There are signs that such moderation is now occurring.Whether or not this more moderate pace is sustained will depend on the net effect of a range of contrasting forces likely to be affecting the economy in the period ahead. Several factors, including a slowdown in global growth, continuing strains in world financial markets and tight domestic financial conditions, are working to dampen demand. Working in the other direction, a further increase in Australia's terms of trade this year will provide a substantial stimulus to incomes and spending. Given the nature of these forces, their net effect is subject to significant uncertainty. On balance, the Board's judgment at this stage is that growth in domestic demand will remain moderate this year, and that this will help to reduce inflation over time."

Most deaths occurred in metropolitan Manila, which already was soaked by heavy monsoon rains ahead of Typhoon Nesat's arrival with more downpours and wind gusts of up to 93 mph (150 kph). Downtown areas along Manila Bay suffered their worst flooding in decades.

""We have secured assurances necessary to support our diverse creator community and have suspended the planned October 1 policy change,"" the company said in a tweet. ""OnlyFans stands for inclusion and we will continue to provide a home for all creators.""
Asked by CNN Business whether the announcement means the policy change might take effect at a later date, and whether the company agreed to make any changes to appease banks and allow for this reversal, OnlyFans said: ""The proposed October 1, 2021 changes are no longer required due to banking partners' assurances that OnlyFans can support all genres of creators.”
The reversal comes just days after OnlyFans announced it would bar creators from posting ""content that contains sexually explicit conduct,"" sparking an outcry among sex workers who had helped create the company's success and popularity. OnlyFans said the changes followed requests by ""banking partners and payout providers.""
In an interview with the Financial Times that published earlier this week, OnlyFans CEO Tim Stokley blamed banks such as Bank of New York Mellon and JP Morgan, whom he said had blocked OnlyFans' payments to creators and shut down their accounts. (Those companies declined to comment to CNN Business on Tuesday.)
Some sex workers were in disbelief following the company's sudden about-face. Just days earlier, OnlyFans had emailed creators with a link to its new acceptable use policy detailing more specifics about the planned sexually explicit conduct ban and informing creators that ""existing content that does not meet the standards of the new policy will need to be removed before December 1, 2021."""
other,"A Chinese nuclear plant has shut down one of its reactors for maintenance after minor damage to fuel rods.
The plant operator said in a statement it had shut Unit 1 at the Taishan nuclear plant in Guangdong province after ""lengthy"" talks with technicians.
Taishan is the first site in the world to have this kind of reactor.
The type of reactor - known as EPR - is also set to be built in other countries, including Finland, France and at Hinkley Point C in the UK.
The latest move comes a month after the Chinese government acknowledged damage to fuel rods at the Taishan unit, but said it was a ""common"" problem, with no need for concern.
China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN) said in a statement on Friday that the reactor was ""completely under control"".
Engineers would find the cause of the damage and replace the fuel rods, the statement read.
In June CNN reported the US government was assessing a reported leak at the site.
CNN said French energy firm EDF, which helps run the site, had warned the US government that China's nuclear regulator had raised limits on permissible levels of radiation outside the plant to avoid shutting it down.
EDF later said a problem with fuel rods had led to the build-up of gases, which had to be released into the atmosphere.
Fuel rods are sealed metal tubes which hold nuclear materials used to fuel the nuclear reactor.
Last week an EDF spokesperson told CNN the French company would shut the plant down if it could.
They said the decision lay with the Chinese operator.
The situation at Taishan was ""not an emergency"" but nevertheless a ""serious situation"", the spokesperson added."

Typhoon,"Tropical storm Edouard is fifth named storm of 2020, earliest such Atlantic storm on record Mother Nature put on her own modest Fourth of July fireworks over the weekend, when Tropical Depression 5 formed near Bermuda on July 4. Despite marginal conditions for development _ sea surface temperatures (SSTs) near 25 degrees Celsius (77°F), moderate wind shear, and dry air _ TD 5 managed to intensify into Tropical Storm Edouard at 11 p.m. EDT July 5. By 11 a.m. EDT July 6, Edouard had intensified to 45 mph winds as it sped northeast at 37 mph over the open Atlantic. Edouard was the earliest fifth Atlantic named storm formation on record, beating the record set by Emily on July 12, 2005. The fifth named storm of the year typically does not occur until August 31, so we are nearly two months ahead of climatology. None of this year’s named storms have been hurricanes, and the first hurricane of the season usually arrives by August 10. According to the Colorado State University real-time hurricane activity site, the North Atlantic has had about 340% of the usual amount of Accumulated Cyclone Energy, or ACE, by July 6: 6.5 units, compared to the 30-year average of 1.9 units. For comparison, the Northeast Pacific has had 3% of its average ACE expected by that same date; the Northwest Pacific 17%; and the North Indian Ocean 234%. All told, the Northern Hemisphere is running at less than half of its usual activity up as of July 6, as the Pacific normally produces the great majority of the hemisphere’s ACE up to that date."

other,"The Committee took note of the upturn in the prices of several items that is masked by the easing of inflation on base effects during October. Despite some supply disruptions, the abrupt compression of demand in November due to the withdrawal of SBNs could push down the prices of perishables in the reading that becomes available in December. On the other hand, prices of wheat, gram and sugar have been firming up. While discretionary spending on goods and services in the CPI excluding food and fuel _ constituting 16 per cent of the CPI basket _ could have been affected by restricted access to cash, the prices of these items may weather these transitory effects as they are normally revised according to pre-set cycles. Prices of housing, fuel and light, health, transport and communication, pan, tobacco and intoxicants, and education _ together accounting for 38 per cent of the CPI basket _ may remain largely unaffected. Going forward, base effects are expected to reverse and turn unfavourable in December and February. If the usual winter moderation in food prices does not materialise due to the disruptions, food inflation pressures could re-emerge. Furthermore, CPI inflation excluding food and fuel has been resistant to downward impulses and could set a floor to headline inflation. With the OPEC¡¯s agreement to cut production, crude prices may firm up in the coming months. Global developments, especially as financial markets factor in the future stance of US monetary and fiscal policy, could impart volatility to the exchange rate thereby feeding into inflation. The withdrawal of SBNs could result in a possible temporary reduction in inflation of the order of 10-15 basis points in Q3. Taking these factors into account, headline inflation is projected at 5 per cent in Q4 of 2016-17 with risks tilted to the upside but lower than in the October policy review. The fuller effects of the house rent allowances under the 7th CPC award are yet to be assessed, pending implementation, and have not been reckoned in this baseline inflation path (Chart 1).The outlook for GVA growth for 2016-17 has turned uncertain after the unexpected loss of momentum by 50 basis points in Q2 and the effects of the withdrawal of SBNs which are still playing out. Downside risks in the near term could travel through two major channels: (a) short-run disruptions in economic activity in cash-intensive sectors such as retail trade, hotels & restaurants and transportation, and in the unorganised sector; (b) aggregate demand compression associated with adverse wealth effects. The impact of the first channel should, however, ebb with the progressive increase in the circulation of new currency notes and greater usage of non-cash based payment instruments in the economy, while the impact of the second channel is likely to be limited. In October 2016, GVA growth in H2 was projected at 7.7 per cent and for the full year at 7.6 per cent. Incorporating the expected loss of growth momentum in Q3 and waning effects in Q4 alongside the boost to consumption demand from higher agricultural output and the implementation of the 7th CPC award, GVA growth for 2016-17 is revised down from 7.6 per cent to 7.1 per cent, with evenly balanced risks (Chart 2)."

other,"While household spending has been reasonably vigorous, we have yet to see convincing signs of a rebound in business outlays. After having fallen sharply over the preceding two years, new orders for capital equipment stabilized and, for some categories, turned up in nominal terms in 2002. Investment in equipment and software is estimated to have risen at a 5 percent rate in real terms in the fourth quarter and a subpar 3 percent over the four quarters of the year.However, the emergence of a sustained and broad-based pickup in capital spending will almost surely require the resumption of substantial gains in corporate profits. Profit margins apparently did improve a bit last year, aided importantly by the strong growth in labor productivity.Of course, the path of capital investment will depend not only on market conditions and the prospects for profits and cash flow but also on the resolution of the uncertainties surrounding the business outlook. Indeed, the heightening of geopolitical tensions has only added to the marked uncertainties that have piled up over the past three years, creating formidable barriers to new investment and thus to a resumption of vigorous expansion of overall economic activity."
drought,"a partnership between the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration – reports that more than 60 million Americans are currently affected by drought conditions.
A multi-agency webinar discussing the status of the drought and response efforts in the region was held Tuesday, hosted by the National Integrated Drought Information System.
The webinar featured remarks from USDA and Interior Department officials, and an update from NOAA Administrator Richard Spinrad, who said the lingering drought costs the U.S. $63 billion annually, in addition to multibillion-dollar losses from wildfires. 
It's a crisis that Spinrad said will only worsen – citing the 1-in-1,000-year June heat wave – as climate change exacerbates the frequency, duration and intensity of drought.
David Simeral, a climatologist with the Western Regional Climate Center, blamed an overall lack of precipitation and rising  temperatures on top of 20 years of drought in the West for creating the current crisis. 
Above-normal temperatures are predicted to continue for the West and northern Plains through the fall, with below-normal precipitation ""modestly favored"" for that season as well.
Jon Gottschalck of the National Weather Service Climate Prediction Center also noted that La Niña climate conditions could also re-emerge in the autumn and winter months of 2021 to 2022."
wildfires,"Californian officials warned on Saturday that ""historic and extreme"" wind conditions were set to fan raging wildfires in the north of the state as millions of residents face power cuts.
Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency as the so-called Kincade Fire spread to 23,700 acres (9,591 hectares) after breaking out on Wednesday in the Sonoma wine region.
The blaze, which is burning in remote steep terrain, has destroyed about 50 structures and forced the evacuation of the small community of Geyserville and of nearby vineyard operations.
""This is definitely an event that we're calling historic and extreme,"" David King, meteorologist for the US National Weather Service, told Saturday's Los Angeles Times.
""What's making this event really substantial... is the amount of time that these winds are going to remain."" Hot, intense winds are expected to pick up on Saturday and last into Monday.
The state's largest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric Co., said it expected to cut off power to 850,000 customers -- a precautionary shutdown that local media say would affect about two million people.
""The weather event could be the most powerful in California in decades,"" PG&E said, with dry northeast winds forecast to gust up to 70 miles per hour (112 kilometers per hour).
""PG&E will need to turn off power for safety several hours before the potentially damaging winds arrive,"" it added.
""Winds of this magnitude pose a higher risk of damage and sparks on the electric system and rapid wildfire spread."" About 1,300 firefighters battled the Kincade Fire, which is only five percent contained, according to the California Department of Forestry and Protection.
""I can't explain it,"" 70-year-old Tina Tavares, who was evacuated from her Geyserville home, told the San Francisco Chronicle.
""It's like you're in a bad earthquake, the ground is opening up... and you're seeing it and don't know what to do."" PG&E has come under fierce scrutiny after it reported that even though power had already been shut down to nearly 28,000 customers in Sonoma County this week, some high-voltage transmission lines were still operating when the fire broke out.
The same type of lines was responsible for California's deadliest wildfire ever -- last year's Camp Fire, which killed 86 people.
PG&E, which filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this year, has been blamed for several other fires in the state in recent years.
Governor Newsom hit out at the company on Friday, saying it had put ""profits over the people of California for too long."" He said it was ""infuriating beyond words"" that a state such as California had to endure blackouts."
other,"Over the past year, growth of Australia's major trading partners (MTPs) has been around its historical average. In China, GDP growth eased marginally over the year to the September quarter, with weakness in the property sector weighing on growth of industrial production, which has slowed a little. Nevertheless, overall growth remains consistent with the authorities' target of 7.5 per cent for this year. In Japan, activity looks to have increased modestly following the sharp decline in output after the consumption tax increase in April. In the rest of east Asia, over the past two quarters output looks to have grown at around its average pace of recent years, while the US economy has grown at an above-trend pace over the same period. Meanwhile, the recovery in the euro area remains fragile, with activity growing only very modestly in recent months. Inflation has been low in all major regions of the world and global financial conditions remain very accommodative.With global economic conditions not changing much over recent months, the outlook is still for Australia's MTP growth to be a little above its long-run average in 2014 and 2015. Growth in China is expected to trend gradually lower, one reason being that policymakers may be willing to accept some easing in growth in order to place financing on a sounder footing. GDP growth in Japan, the rest of east Asia and the euro area is expected to be around their averages of the past decade, which are quite a bit slower than their longer-term averages. Growth in the US economy is expected to continue at an above-trend pace."
other,"Measures of inflation other than the CPI have shown mixed movements since the April MPR. After the HRA-linked spike in January 2018, inflation in terms of CPI for industrial workers (CPI-IW) declined in line with inflation in CPI for agricultural labourers (AL) and rural labourers (RL), reflecting inter alia soft food inflation readings. CPI-IW reflects changes in its housing index once in six months _ in January and July every year. The revision in CPI-IW housing index _ from 3.0 per cent in December 2017 to 10.2 per cent in January 2018 and further to 26.1 per cent in July _ created sizeable upside impulses pushing CPI-IW inflation significantly above headline CPI inflation in July.7 Accordingly, as the impact of the HRA increase intensified, CPI-IW inflation shot up to 5.6 per cent in August from 3.9 per cent in June.In contrast, wholesale price index (WPI) inflation firmed up significantly in Q1, driven up by international prices of crude petroleum and high speed diesel. Inflation in respect of electricity, naphtha, furnace oil, manufacture of plastic products, manufactured vegetable and animal oils and fats also fuelled WPI inflation. GDP and GVA deflators also ticked up in Q1 in line with WPI inflation (Chart II.17a) which moderated somewhat in July and August with the collapse in food inflation.Volatile prices of items such as transport fuel, vegetables, pulses and precious metals impart high dispersion, asymmetry and non-normality to the distribution of inflation. High positive as well as negative skew and chronic fat tails in the inflation distribution could be removed by trimming the outliers. Trimmed means of CPI, including its weighted median, rose sharply in Q1:2018-19 before softening in July and August (Chart II.17b)."
other,"To address both the near- and longer-term issues, the Congress and the Administration should consider replacing the sharp, frontloaded spending cuts required by the sequestration with policies that reduce the federal deficit more gradually in the near term but more substantially in the longer run. Such an approach could lessen the near-term fiscal headwinds facing the recovery while more effectively addressing the longer-term imbalances in the federal budget.The sizes of deficits and debt matter, of course, but not all tax and spending programs are created equal with respect to their effects on the economy. To the greatest extent possible, in their efforts to achieve sound public finances, fiscal policymakers should not lose sight of the need for federal tax and spending policies that increase incentives to work and save, encourage investments in workforce skills, advance private capital formation, promote research and development, and provide necessary and productive public infrastructure. Although economic growth alone cannot eliminate federal budget imbalances, in either the short or longer term, a more rapidly expanding economic pie will ease the difficult choices we face."

other,"The Australian economy has remained robust in the recent period, notwithstanding a more difficult international environment. Domestic demand and activity have remained strong and capacity usage is high after a long period of economic expansion. These conditions have been associated with a rise in inflation. Hence Australian monetary policy has had to take into account sharply contrasting domestic and international developments.The global economic situation in recent months has been marked by ongoing turbulence in financial markets, reflected most obviously in a decline in world equity prices. The primary drivers have been the ongoing write-downs of credit exposures by major global financial institutions and increased concerns about the US and global economic outlook. Equity markets in the major industrial economies have fallen back to around their levels at the beginning of 2007, as has the Australian market. Emerging stock markets, which initially had been relatively resilient, have also experienced declines."
other,"In the services sector, some of the high frequency indicators improved. Commercial vehicle sales growth touched an eight-year high in December. Cargo carried by sea, rail and air also registered higher growth in November, but showed mixed performance in December. Other indicators such as domestic and international air passenger traffic and foreign tourist arrivals grew at a fast pace in November-December. The services PMI expanded sequentially in December and January on the back of higher business activity.Retail inflation, measured by the year-on-year change in the consumer price index (CPI), increased for the sixth consecutive month in December on account of a strong unfavourable base effect. After rising abruptly in November, food prices reversed partly in December, reflecting mainly the seasonal moderation, albeit muted, in prices of vegetables along with continuing decline in prices of pulses. Cereals inflation moderated with prices remaining steady in December. However, inflation in some components of food _ eggs; meat and fish; oils and fats; and milk _ increased. Fuel and light group inflation, which showed a sharp increase in November, softened somewhat in December, driven by moderation in electricity, LPG and kerosene inflation.CPI inflation excluding food and fuel increased further in November and December, largely on account of increase in housing inflation following the implementation of higher house rent allowances (HRA) for government employees under the 7th central pay commission (CPC) award. Inflation also picked up in health and personal care and effects. Reflecting incomplete pass-through to domestic petroleum product prices, inflation in transport and communication remained muted in December. Inflation also slowed down in clothing and footwear, household goods and services, recreation, and education."
other,"The phenomenon of cryptocurrency is on its way to transforming the global monetary system. That¡¯s not going to happen right away, or next year, or any specific time in the foreseeable future, but it¡¯s here to stay. You might compare it to the advent of coins made of precious metals as the way to buy and sell products a few thousand years ago rather than simply trade one product for another. Or perhaps to understand its enormity, consider the rise of paper currency in place of coins or perhaps the advent of accounts to and from which money flows by paper checks.At last, the Treasury Department has taken the initiative by decreeing that the Internal Revenue Service has to know about any movement of cryptocurrency above $10,000. The whole point is to make it more difficult to avoid taxes by investing in cryptocurrency, but enforcement will be difficult considering that so many transactions are outside the U.S. Who¡¯s to know what¡¯s going on?Now, with the rise of the internet, cryptocurrency is so easily used as a medium of payment, of buying and selling, even of saving money, that it¡¯s tempting to ask why all of us are not getting into it.

U.S. real exports of goods and services increased at an annual rate of about 11 percent in the second half of last year, boosted by continuing economic growth abroad and the lower foreign exchange value of the dollar.  Strengthening exports, together with moderating imports, have in turn led to some improvement in the U.S. current account deficit, which likely narrowed in 2007 (on an annual basis) for the first time since 2001.  Although recent indicators point to some slowing of foreign economic growth, U.S. exports should continue to expand at a healthy pace in coming quarters, providing some impetus to domestic economic activity and employment.As I have mentioned, financial markets continue to be under considerable stress.  Heightened investor concerns about the credit quality of mortgages, especially subprime mortgages with adjustable interest rates, triggered the financial turmoil.  However, other factors, including a broader retrenchment in the willingness of investors to bear risk, difficulties in valuing complex or illiquid financial products, uncertainties about the exposures of major financial institutions to credit losses, and concerns about the weaker outlook for economic growth, have also roiled the financial markets in recent months.  To help relieve the pressures in the market for interbank lending, the Federal Reserve--among other actions--recently introduced a term auction facility (TAF), through which prespecified amounts of discount window credit are auctioned to eligible borrowers, and we have been working with other central banks to address market strains that could hamper the achievement of our broader economic objectives.  These efforts appear to have contributed to some improvement in short-term funding markets.  We will continue to monitor financial developments closely.As part of its ongoing commitment to improving the accountability and public understanding of monetary policy making, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) recently increased the frequency and expanded the content of the economic projections made by Federal Reserve Board members and Reserve Bank presidents and released to the public.  The latest economic projections, which were submitted in conjunction with the FOMC meeting at the end of January and which are based on each participant's assessment of appropriate monetary policy, show that real GDP was expected to grow only sluggishly in the next few quarters and that the unemployment rate was seen as likely to increase somewhat.  In particular, the central tendency of the projections was for real GDP to grow between 1.3 percent and 2.0 percent in 2008, down from 2-1/2 percent to 2-3/4 percent projected in our report last July.  FOMC participants' projections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2008 have a central tendency of 5.2 percent to 5.3 percent, up from the level of about 4-3/4 percent projected last July for the same period.  The downgrade in our projections for economic activity in 2008 since our report last July reflects the effects of the financial turmoil on real activity and a housing contraction that has been more severe than previously expected.  By 2010, our most recent projections show output growth picking up to rates close to or a little above its longer-term trend and the unemployment rate edging lower; the improvement reflects the effects of policy stimulus and an anticipated moderation of the contraction in housing and the strains in financial and credit markets.  The incoming information since our January meeting continues to suggest sluggish economic activity in the near term."
other,"The Singapore economy is expected to continue its recovery path going forward.  Nevertheless, it will take time for the expansion to gather momentum and become more broad-based, before a significant improvement in the labour market can be seen.  Against this backdrop, it is necessary for monetary policy to remain supportive of the recovery in the domestic economy, while keeping inflation low. MAS will therefore maintain the current neutral policy stance of a zero percent appreciation of the S$NEER policy path in the period ahead, with no change in the level at which the policy band is centred and in the width of the band.

other,"The central bank's lending and deposit facilities are policy instruments through which it supplies loans to or receives deposits from individual financial institutions (under the Bank of Korea Act, financial institutions are limited to banking institutions). Traditionally, a central bank's monetary policy instruments refer to its lending facilities along with its open market operations and reserve requirement regime. As a number of central banks have introduced standing facilities allowing individual financial institutions to both take out temporary loans and make temporary deposits, their lending facilities have developed into lending and deposit facilities.The Bank of Korea also extended and reformed its existing lending facilities to turn them into lending and deposit facilities, by newly introducing Liquidity Adjustment Loans and Deposits, the standing facilities, in March 2008."
earthquake,"A 6.8 magnitude earthquake that also measured a strong 5 on the shindo (intensity) scale struck off Japan’s northeastern coast on Saturday but no tsunami warning was issued, Japanese and U.S. authorities said, with no immediate reports of damage.
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) said the midmorning quake hit at a depth of 47 kilometers (29 miles) in the Pacific, off Ishinomaki, Miyagi prefecture, near the epicenter of the huge March 2011 quake that triggered a towering tsunami, killing more than 18,000 people.
The USGS and Meteorological Agency said there was no tsunami risk following the jolt, which produced strong shaking along parts of the eastern coast and was also felt in Tokyo.
Officials in Aomori, Fukushima and Iwate said no casualties had been reported and public broadcaster NHK said there were no immediate reports of damage.
But a Meteorological Agency official warned strong aftershocks may hit the region in about a week, adding that expected bad weather may trigger landslides following the latest ground shaking.
Two people were slightly injured after windows were broken at a station in Onagawa, Miyagi, NHK said.
“We are aware of the news but still collecting information,” said Kazuto Takeda, an official with the prefecture’s disaster management office.
NHK also said a woman in her 80s was treated in hospital after she fell at a supermarket in Fukushima.
Some sections of expressways and train services, including those on the Tohoku Shinkansen Line, were suspended following the temblor, which was also felt in Tokyo.
Tokyo Electric Power Co. Holdings is checking for any irregularities at its nuclear power plant in Fukushima, according to NHK. Tohoku Electric Power Co. found no abnormalities at its Onagawa, Higashidori nuclear plants, according to a spokesperson.
Saturday marked the first day of a five-day holiday and a number of people were seen evacuating from JR Sendai Station, with university student Asuka Koike, who was on her way to her hometown in Fukushima Prefecture, saying, “I don’t know what to do. I’m afraid as there have been many earthquakes recently.”
Japan sits on the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” an arc of intense seismic activity that stretches through Southeast Asia and across the Pacific basin.

other,"The surge in low cost current account and savings account (CASA) deposits into the banking system post demonetisation, coupled with the aggressive reduction in term deposit rates, aided the pass through of policy rate cuts to lending rates of commercial banks (Table IV.3). The speed of transmission gathered momentum from November 2016, with lending rates falling faster than term deposit rates. This also reflected the still subdued demand for credit and the availability of alternative non-bank sources of financing. The extent of reduction in lending rates on outstanding loans continued to be relatively small though, due to sticky interest rates on base-rate- linked loans and the 1-year reset period of MCLR-linked loans.Since January 2015 _ when the accommodative cycle of monetary policy commenced _ the median base rate has declined by 80 basis points (bps) as against the cumulative decline of 200 bps in the policy repo rate. Significantly, the pace of decline in the base rate slackened drastically after the introduction of the MCLR in April 2016. As the proportion of outstanding loans linked to the base rate (which were contracted during July 2010 _ March 2016) declined only gradually through 2016-17 and in 2017-18, the transmission of policy rate cuts to outstanding loans amounted to 55 bps during 2017-18 (up to February), albeit higher than 40 bps during 2016-17. As a result, the monthly median spread between the WALR and one-year MCLRs of individual banks declined after scaling a peak in January 2017 (Chart IV.25)."
other,"On the supply side, growth of gross value added (GVA) at basic prices decelerated to 6.9 per cent in Q2, reflecting moderation in agricultural and industrial activities. Slowdown in agricultural GVA was largely the outcome of tepid growth in kharif production. Within industry, growth in manufacturing decelerated due to lower profitability of manufacturing firms, pulled down largely by a rise in input costs, while that in mining and quarrying turned negative, caused by a contraction in output of crude oil and natural gas. Growth in electricity, gas, water supply and other utility services strengthened. Services sector growth remained unchanged at the previous quarter¡¯s level. Of its constituents, growth in construction activity decelerated sequentially, but it was much higher on a y-o-y basis. Growth in public administration and defence services accelerated sharply.Looking beyond Q2, rabi sowing so far (up to end-November) has been 8.3 per cent lower as compared with the same period last year due mainly to lower soil moisture levels resulting from a deficient monsoon and a delayed kharif harvest across states. Precipitation during the north-east monsoon as on November 28 was 49 per cent below the long period average. Storage in major reservoirs, the main source of irrigation during the rabi season, was at 61 per cent of the full reservoir level as on November 29.Growth in the index of industrial production (IIP) slowed down to 4.5 per cent in September 2018. Capacity utilisation (CU), measured by the Reserve Bank¡¯s Order Books, Inventories and Capacity Utilisation Survey (OBICUS), increased from 73.8 per cent in Q1 to 76.1 per cent in Q2, which was higher than the long-term average of 74.9 per cent; seasonally adjusted CU also increased to 76.4 per cent. Available high frequency indicators suggest that industrial activity has been improving in Q3. The growth in core industries recovered in October on the back of double-digit expansion in coal, cement and electricity. The purchasing managers¡¯ index (PMI) for manufacturing touched an eleven-month high of 54.0 in November, supported by an expansion in output, and domestic and export orders. According to the assessment of the Reserve Bank¡¯s Industrial Outlook Survey (IOS), the overall business sentiment in Q3 remained stable, with sustained optimism about production and exports."
wildfires,"California firefighters coping with limited resources and worsening weather struggled for a fifth day on Thursday to subdue flames menacing the famed Napa Valley wine region, while major progress was reported against a separate, deadly blaze in the Cascades.
The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said more than 17,000 fire personnel remained on the front lines of two dozen major wildfires across the state, with over 96,000 residents under evacuation orders.
Roughly half of those evacuees have been displaced by a fast-spreading blaze dubbed the Glass Fire, which erupted on Sunday near the Napa Valley resort of Calistoga, some 75 miles (120 km) north of San Francisco, then spread into neighboring Sonoma County.
After a brief respite from fierce gusts that had fanned early growth of the blaze, fire crews on Thursday faced a return of strong winds, combined with above-normal heat and extremely low humidity, prompting red-flag warnings of heightened wildfire risks.
The incendiary weather, supercharging fuel beds overgrown with tinder-dry grass and scrub, is expected to challenge firefighters through the weekend as they battle to defend Napa Valley’s homes and wineries in the midst of its harvest season.
“It’s going to be a big firefight for us in the next 36 hours,” Cal Fire operations section chief Mark Brunton told a late-morning briefing. He added commanders were forced to make due with “a limited amount of resources” due to competing demands for fire personnel throughout the state.
As of Thursday, firefighters have managed to carve firm containment lines around just 5% of the Glass Fire perimeter, which has grown to encompass nearly 57,000 acres (23,000 hectares)."
drought,"From ground level, Australia's drought looks like a featureless brown dustbowl, but from the air it transforms into an artistry of colour and texture as the land cracks under a blazing sun.
Circular dry plough tracks resemble the concentric circles in Aboriginal dot paintings that tell of an ancient mythology, starving cattle queuing for feed look like an abstract painting, and their black shadows stretching across the land a surrealist image.
But for farmer Ash Whitney there is no such beauty, just blood, sweat and tears as he struggles to feed his cattle, cutting the drying branches of Kurrajong trees _ a last resort during the worst of droughts.
“I have been here all my life, and this drought is feeling like it will be around a while,” says a despairing Whitney, whose property near the town of Gunnedah is on the Liverpool Plains _ a usually fertile area now withered, having received the lowest average rainfall in nearly 30 years.
The worst drought in living memory is sweeping parts of eastern Australia, leaving farmers struggling to cope and asking questions about the future.
Cattle farmer Tom Wollaston, born 70 years ago in the same house he lives in today, is afraid for what this drought will mean for his children, who aim to takeover the 2,300 hectare (5,683 acre) property when Tom “hangs up his boots”.
“I can't seem to be able to do anything else apart from just feed, and keep things going. The drought seems to be one step ahead of me all the time. We'll battle it out, but it puts a strain on everyone,” says Wollaston.
His wife Margo says droughts have a very negative impact, not only on her family but on the whole farming community around the nearby town of Tamworth in northwest New South Wales (NSW) state.
“I find droughts a little bit like cancer _ it sort of eats away at you, and it just gets drier and drier and more severe and more severe, and impacting on your life a lot worse. I do try really hard to keep the house and the garden clean and green because that keeps your head in the right space at night time”.
May McKeown, 79, and her son Jimmie live on a property near the northwest NSW town of Walgett and say they are extremely worried about the future, having had almost no rain since 2010.
“My great grandfather settled on this land in 1901, and he never had to remove cattle from the paddocks over there,” she says pointing to the west. “But we have had to remove them all and bring them closer to the homestead so we can more easily feed them.”"
other,"Beginning in mid-March, economic activity fell at an unprecedented speed in response to the outbreak of the virus and the measures taken to control its spread. Even after the unexpectedly positive May employment report, nearly 20 million jobs have been lost on net since February, and the reported unemployment rate has risen about 10 percentage points, to 13.3 percent. The decline in real gross domestic product (GDP) this quarter is likely to be the most severe on record. The burden of the downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans. Instead, those least able to withstand the downturn have been affected most. As discussed in the June Monetary Policy Report, low-income households have experienced, by far, the sharpest drop in employment, while job losses of African Americans, Hispanics, and women have been greater than that of other groups. If not contained and reversed, the downturn could further widen gaps in economic well-being that the long expansion had made some progress in closing.Recently, some indicators have pointed to a stabilization, and in some areas a modest rebound, in economic activity. With an easing of restrictions on mobility and commerce and the extension of federal loans and grants, some businesses are opening up, while stimulus checks and unemployment benefits are supporting household incomes and spending. As a result, employment moved higher in May. That said, the levels of output and employment remain far below their pre-pandemic levels, and significant uncertainty remains about the timing and strength of the recovery. Much of that economic uncertainty comes from uncertainty about the path of the disease and the effects of measures to contain it. Until the public is confident that the disease is contained, a full recovery is unlikely.Moreover, the longer the downturn lasts, the greater the potential for longer-term damage from permanent job loss and business closures. Long periods of unemployment can erode workers' skills and hurt their future job prospects. Persistent unemployment can also negate the gains made by many disadvantaged Americans during the long expansion and described to us at our Fed Listens events. The pandemic is presenting acute risks to small businesses, as discussed in the Monetary Policy Report. If a small or medium-sized business becomes insolvent because the economy recovers too slowly, we lose more than just that business. These businesses are the heart of our economy and often embody the work of generations.With weak demand and large price declines for some goods and services¡ªsuch as apparel, gasoline, air travel, and hotels¡ªconsumer price inflation has dropped noticeably in recent months. But indicators of longer-term inflation expectations have been fairly steady. As output stabilizes and the recovery moves ahead, inflation should stabilize and then gradually move back up over time closer to our symmetric 2 percent objective. Inflation is nonetheless likely to remain below our objective for some time."
Typhoon,"Tropical Storm Arthur forms in the Atlantic (CNN)Two weeks before the official start to Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Arthur has become the first named storm of the year -- but it's expected to brush the US coast before heading back out to sea. At 8 p.m. Sunday, Arthur's outer bands were skirting the North Carolina coast, the National Hurricane Center said. A tropical storm warning was in effect for Surf City north to Duck, an area that includes the Outer Banks barrier islands, meaning tropical storm conditions are expected sometime in the next 24 hours. Heavy rain, dangerous coastal surf conditions and rip currents are expected in the warning area, the hurricane center said. Arthur was about 260 miles south-southwest of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, moving toward the state at around 9 mph, the National Hurricane Center said in its 8 p.m. advisory. ""A turn toward the northeast with an increase in forward speed is forecast to occur later tonight or on Monday,"" the NHC said. ""A turn toward the east is expected on Tuesday."" The storm's center is forecast to stay ""well offshore of the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina"" Sunday night and move near or just east of the North Carolina coast on Monday, the hurricane center said. Arthur is forecast to turn away from the United States on Monday night and into Tuesday."
Typhoon,"Heavy rainfall was expected all through the weekend in northern and northeastern Taiwan due to the approach of Typhoon Fitow, the Central Weather Bureau said Saturday.
The bureau issued a land warning for Taipei, New Taipei, Keelung and Yilan Saturday afternoon, though it added that torrential rain was possible as far south as Taichung and Nantou County.
At 9 p.m. Saturday, Fitow was located about 440 kilometers east of Taipei and moving west-north-west at a speed of 19 km per hour, according to the weather bureau. The storm was packing sustained winds of 137 km per hour with gusts of up to 173 km per hour. The storm’s route was 20 to 40 km more southerly than originally expected, which meant Taoyuan and Hsinchu could eventually also be covered by the land warnings, reports said.
By early Sunday afternoon, the center of the storm would have moved to 240 km northeast of Taipei over the ocean, the bureau said. The eye of the typhoon was unlikely to make landfall but nevertheless, forecasters still cautioned residents to be prepared for strong winds and heavy rains as well as flooding and mudslides, even in southern mountain areas.
The total amount of rainfall in the north could reach 350 millimeter over the next 24 hours, according to the bureau. The highest amount of rain Saturday until 9:20 p.m. was the 151 mm recorded in New Taipei City’s Wulai District.
Sea warnings were also in effect on Taiwan’s east side and in most of the Taiwan Straits with the exception of the Kaohsiung and Pingtung coastal areas. Strong waves were expected to hit most coastal areas, including those of Orchid Island and Green Island in the southeast, the bureau said.
The typhoon would leave Taiwan behind on Monday, but another storm was already on the way, according to the bureau.
The next tropical storm on the horizon, Danas, was unlikely to speed up sufficiently to combine forces with Fitow, experts said. Fitow was expected to make landfall in China Monday and to weaken considerably thereafter, while Danas was likely to move in the direction of Japan, though it was not clear yet how serious its impact on Taiwan might be. Some forecasters have suggested that the storm might affect the island’s Double Ten National Day celebrations Thursday.
President Ma Ying-jeou and Premier Jiang Yi-huah visited the national emergency center late Saturday afternoon to receive an overview of the situation, reports said."
other,"Hong Kong police are investigating an incident where a crowd watching the Olympics booed China's anthem.

Hundreds gathered at a shopping mall on Monday to watch a broadcast and cheer on Hong Kong fencer Edgar Cheung, who won gold in the men's individual foil.

When the Chinese national anthem was played, some in the crowd began jeering while others shouted ""We are Hong Kong"", video filmed at the scene shows.

It is illegal to insult the anthem under a recently passed law.

Anyone found guilty of flouting the national anthem law could be jailed up to three years and fined HK$50,000 (£4,600, $6,400).

Reports also said that the British colonial flag was flown and some had chanted protest slogans, which could possibly violate the national security law which forbids anything that incites ""secession"" and could result in life in jail.

Police sources told local media that they are collecting and examining footage from the mall's security cameras.

The incident took place in the same week as the conviction of the first person charged under the national security law.

Both laws were passed last year and have been met with huge controversy, with critics saying they clamp down on free speech.

But Hong Kong authorities and the Chinese government deny this and say the laws are necessary to preserve peace and patriotism.

Hong Kong saw widespread protests in 2019 when tens of thousands took to the streets demanding democratic reforms. Some of those demonstrations turned violent as protesters and police clashed.

Since then China has cracked down hard, introducing several strict laws aimed at curbing violence and what it deems as ""separatism"".

Hong Kong, a former British colony, was handed back to China in 1997.

Since then it has been ruled under the ""one country, two systems"" principle that preserves freedoms in the city that the mainland does not have.

Critics say those freedoms are now under threat with China's recent moves and the UK has accused China of flouting the terms of its handover agreement, but China denies this."
Typhoon,"Rescuers continued to search central Japan on Monday as the death toll from the worst typhoon to hit the country in seven years climbed to 26.
Typhoon Talas, later downgraded to a tropical storm, lashed coastal areas at the weekend before moving offshore into the Sea of Japan. Fifty-two people were missing and thousands stranded as the typhoon washed away bridges, railways and roads.
The scenes of destruction were an unwelcome reminder of Japan's vulnerability to natural disasters as the country attempts to recover from the 11 March earthquake and tsunami.
The prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, who was sworn in a day before the storm, said the government would provide assistance as quickly as possible.
His predecessor, Naoto Kan, was forced out of office chiefly because of public anger over the government's response to the tsunami, which left nearly 21,000 people dead or missing and sparked the world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986."
other,"The effectiveness of the new regulations, however, will depend critically on strong enforcement.  To that end, in conjunction with other federal and state agencies, we are conducting compliance reviews of a range of mortgage lenders, including nondepository lenders.  The agencies will collaborate in determining the lessons learned and in seeking ways to better cooperate in ensuring effective and consistent examinations of, and improved enforcement for, all categories of mortgage lenders.The Federal Reserve continues to work with financial institutions, public officials, and community groups around the country to help homeowners avoid foreclosures.  We have called on mortgage lenders and servicers to pursue prudent loan workouts and have supported the development of streamlined, systematic approaches to expedite the loan modification process.  We also have been providing community groups, counseling agencies, regulators, and others with detailed analyses to help identify neighborhoods at high risk from foreclosures so that local outreach efforts to help troubled borrowers can be as focused and effective as possible.  We are actively pursuing other ways to leverage the Federal Reserve's analytical resources, regional presence, and community connections to address this critical issue.In addition to our consumer protection efforts in the mortgage area, we are working toward finalizing rules under the Truth in Lending Act that will require new, more informative, and consumer-tested disclosures by credit card issuers.  Separately, we are actively reviewing potentially unfair and deceptive practices by issuers of credit cards.  Using the Board's authority under the Federal Trade Commission Act, we expect to issue proposed rules regarding these practices this spring."

Typhoon,"Cyclonic storm Tauktae has intensified and may hit the Gujarat coast by Tuesday, the weather office said on Saturday. Gujarat and Diu coasts are under a cyclone watch. This is the first cyclonic storm this year as India fights a deadly second wave of Covid, which has led to a frightening surge in the country's caseload over the last two months.
The cyclone could also bring ""very heavy to extremely heavy rainfall"" triggering flash floods and landslides over the coastal districts of Kerala, Karnataka and Goa till Sunday. Mumbai can expect showers from Sunday afternoon, officials said.
""Cyclone Tauktae is very likely to intensify further into a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm during next 12 hours and intensify further. It is very likely to move north-northwestwards and reach Gujarat coast in the morning of 18th and cross Gujarat coast between Porbandar and Naliya around 18th May Afternoon / evening,"" the IMD said in its latest update.

The Western Railway said it has cancelled 56 trains either originating or terminating in Gujarat''s Saurashtra region as a precaution.
In Delhi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi reviewed the preparedness of states, central ministries and agencies tasked with dealing with the situation arising out of cyclone Tauktae and asked them to take every possible measure to ensure that people are safely evacuated.
Heavy rain was reported in Maharashtra's coastal Ratnagiri district on Saturday, said K S Hosalikar, head SID, Climate Research and Services, IMD, Pune.
The IMD has issued an ""orange alert""' which means heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely over entire Konkan and hilly areas of western Maharashtra, mainly Kolhapur and Satara on Sunday and Monday, she said.

drought,"Water companies, government bodies and environmental groups have warned that the extreme weather this summer could lead to a drought in spring next year.
Heatwaves across the country saw hosepipe bans come into force and put pressure on farmers, whose harvests were affected by the dry conditions.
The National Drought Group (NDG), which is made up of various water and environment organisations, gathered on Thursday to discuss how to maintain supplies in the event of a 2019 drought.
Water companies, government bodies and environmental groups have warned that the extreme weather this summer could lead to a drought in spring next year.
Heatwaves across the country saw hosepipe bans come into force and put pressure on farmers, whose harvests were affected by the dry conditions.
The National Drought Group (NDG), which is made up of various water and environment organisations, gathered on Thursday to discuss how to maintain supplies in the event of a 2019 drought.
Sir James Bevan, chief executive of the Environment Agency, chaired the NDG meeting and said that early action and planning would be necessary to avert this situation.
“Ensuring sufficient water for the public, the economy and the environment is one of biggest challenges we face as a country,” he said.
“The Environment Agency will continue to work actively with the water companies and other water users to seek to ensure that.”
Dry conditions over the summer were linked to devastating fires around Oldham and Bolton, and caused disruption to British wildlife including hedgehogs, birds and frogs.
The Environment Agency responded to more than 300 dry-weather related incidents over the past few months, more than three times the usual number for the summer.
Farmers accused the government of taking “little action” after environment secretary Michael Gove pledged to help them recover from the challenging summer conditions.
Recent efforts to save water combined with spells of rain have helped the sector recover, but for some crops and species the full effects of the summer are yet to be seen."
other,"The global economy has continued to recover, with growth over the past year generally exceeding earlier expectations. There are, however, signs that global growth is now moderating from its above-trend pace over the past year, and the extent of the recovery varies significantly across regions. It has been strongest in Asia, with a number of countries in the region again approaching capacity constraints. In contrast, growth in the major North Atlantic economies has been more subdued, with these economies likely to continue operating with high levels of excess capacity for some years to come.Overall, the Bank expects global growth to be around trend over the coming year, although uncertainty about the outlook remains elevated. In May and June, risk aversion rose globally as investors' concerns about the outlook for public finances in Europe and the health of the European banking system increased. Since then, risk aversion has abated somewhat reflecting a number of factors, including the establishment of new financial stability arrangements in Europe; the announcement of fiscal consolidation programs by most European governments; and the publication of the results of the stress test of the banking system. The recent economic data in Europe have also been more positive, although the outlook remains subdued. In the United States, the economy is also continuing to recover, although growth over the second half of the year is likely to be slower."

The Bhutan villagers, who had been collecting cordeyceps, a fungus used in medicine, were sleeping when the floodwaters hit just after midnight. Their camp near Laya, about 60 km (37 miles) north of the capital Thimphu, was washed away, local media reported.

earthquake,"6.9-magnitude quake hits Papua New Guinea A powerful 6.9-magnitude earthquake struck eastern Papua New Guinea Friday, rocking residents across the pacific nation, the US Geological Survey reported. The quake struck at a depth of 85 kilometres (51 miles) near the eastern coast around 150 kilometres from the capital, Port Moresby, it said. People scrambled from office buildings in the capital after being jolted by the quake, which hit around 12:50pm local time (0250 GMT). Reports said the quake was felt in towns and cities across a wide swathe of the country and as far as Bougainville island, 900 kilometres off the coast. There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre initially issued a warning of potentially hazardous waves in nearby coastal areas, but later cancelled the alert."

Typhoon,"With one of the largest storms seen for years bearing down upon the Korean Peninsula, both Koreas have today warned of the potential for danger.
Chosun Central News Agency reported on the approach of ‘Typhoon Bolaven’ this afternoon, saying, “Typhoon-15 is now moving northwestward at a velocity of 12km/h, as of 09:00 Thursday.”
“It is expected to come to the sea off Shanghai, China on around August 27th and move northward along the west coastal area of Korea before reaching the Chinese northeastern region on the evening of August 28th. The typhoon-15 will trigger strong wind and heavy rains in overall areas of Korea on August 27th and 28th,” the brief report added.
According to South Korea’s meteorological authorities, meanwhile, Typhoon Bolaven was 460km south of Sogwipo, the largest city on the south coast of Jeju Island, at 12PM today, moving at 34km/h in a north-northwesterly direction. It appears set to make landfall over Hwanghae Province in North Korea late on the afternoon of the 28th.
With that particular region only just recovering from serious flooding, the typhoon is likely to be an unwelcome, and damaging, addition to what has been a difficult summer."
wildfires,"A wildfire is burning out of control on North Mountain in Pendleton County in the Monongahela National Forest. More than 80 foresters and local firefighters are battling the blaze that started on Sunday near Upper Tract.
“[The fire] started on private land and it’s moved west/northwest on to national forest land, southwest of Petersburg,” according to Sarah Hankens with the U.S. Forest Service.
The blaze is 20 percent contained. It’s being called the North Mountain Fire and so far has destroyed 720 acres.
Bob Beanblossom with the U.S. Forest Service said crews are having a hard time reaching some parts of the fire because of the terrain in the Potomac Highlands.
“It is steep, rocky terrain. There are a lot of standing, dead trees that firefighters have to be careful of. It does certainly pose some hazards.” Beanblossom said half the battle is reaching those remote areas.
The fire is so large, the U.S. Forest Service has called in crews from out west.
“We have a lot of folks here from the Monongahela National Forest but there are crews from as far west as Oregon, Idaho and Washington,” explained Beanblossom.
Even more foresters are set to arrive from Tennessee, Virginia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Wisconsin.
Most of the fire is contained within the national forest and that’s where crews want to keep it.
“There is private property adjacent to the forest, not too far from where the fire is located,” said Hankens. “We do have personnel out on the fire line assessing both direct and indirect ways to create fire lines to try and keep the fire on national forest.”
So far, that part of Pendleton County has not seen any of the rain or snow much of the state received Tuesday morning. However, the humidity is high and that’s keeping the flames from spreading faster. Beanblossom said precipitation would drastically help the effort to gain control of the blaze."
flood,"Bhutan: Flash floods kill 10 cordeycep collectors in Laya According to Tshering, the head of Laya, five others were severely injured. Two choppers were mobilised to evacuate the injured. Rescue and relief efforts are still on. In a tragic incident at Laya village under Gasa district in North Bhutan, 10 people died and five others were injured after a camp full of cordeycep (fungus used in medicines) collectors was washed away in a flash flood that occurred after midnight on Wednesday. The Cordyceps Collection Site is at Tshari-Jathang, Ri-Druzhi.  Laya is located 3,800 metres above sea-level in the northern Himalayan region of Bhutan bordering Tibet."
wildfires,"An evacuation order for the community of Mineral was issued at 10 p.m. by the Tehama County Sheriff’s Office on Tuesday night, making the area the latest to be threatened by the Dixie Fire.
The sheriff’s office said Mineral residents could evacuate to the Veterans Hall in Los Molinos and should leave Mineral westbound on Highway 36.
With winds shifting to the north overnight, red flag warnings were extended to 8 p.m. Wednesday. The winds were expected to reach 15-25 mph with 35 mph gusts. Combined with humidity in the 9-15% range, according to the National Weather Service, conditions were ripe for another day of rapid fire growth.
Red flag warnings remained in place throughout the east and west zones of the Dixie Fire with additional evacuation warnings issued in Lassen County.
The new evacuation warnings issued are for Lake Forest Estates and Eagle Lake Road A1 from Highway 36 north to the County Access gate and east to Prattville Road and north to Paiute Creek. Additional evacuation warnings were put in place for west of Highway 395 from the A25 Herlong Access Rd intersection south to the A26 Garnier Road intersection
The evacuation orders announced Monday evening are still in place with the Lassen County Sheriff’s Office and Cal Fire releasing updates through Facebook. Included in the evacuation areas is south of Highway 36 from Devil’s Corral east to Britt Lane and Thumper Hill, and south to Cheney Creek Road.
Additional mandatory evacuation orders were issued for Janesville west of Highway 395 from Janesville Grade south to Mill Street just before Milford Grade, for the Bizz Johnson Trail area south of Highway 36 from Thumper Hill east to Miller Crossing and south to Bauer Road, and for the Janesville area west of Highway 395 from the Bass Hill area south to Janesville Grade, including the Janesville side of Wingfield Road and west to the Lassen County line.
All previous evacuation warnings remain in place, Lassen County Sheriff’s Office said.
While there are currently no evacuation orders in Butte County, evacuation warnings remain in effect for the areas of Butte Meadows, Jonesville, Snag Lake and Lake Philbrook.
Throughout the day Tuesday, the Dixie Fire grew an additional 22,240 acres bringing the total acreage burnt to 626,751. Cal Fire reported containment remained at 31 percent, a number which has not risen since Thursday evening.
The fire, which started July 13 in the Feather River Canyon near the Cresta Powerhouse, has an expected containment date which remains “to be determined.”
Cal Fire said it has tracked an additional 28 structures destroyed, bringing the total to 1,208 structures which have been destroyed by the fire, with 81 structures damaged. 16,085 structures remain threatened by the fire.
The fire is the second-largest fire in state history. The largest fire in California history is last year’s North Complex fires, which burned 1,032,648 acres in parts of Mendocino, Humboldt, Trinity, Tehama, Glenn, Lake and Colusa counties."
wildfires,"The number of fires in the Amazon jumped 20 percent this June compared to June last year, raising concerns that the rainforest could see a repeat of last year's destructive fires.
INPE, Brazil's government space research agency, detected 2,248 fires in June this year, a 13-year high for the month, according to Reuters. Last June, 1,880 fires were detected.
In June 2020, researchers saw an average of 75 fires a day in the Amazon. Last August, during the peak of the massive forest fires that caused global outcry, there were about 1,000 fires detected per day.
While the fires are not yet as bad as last year's, health experts are especially concerned due to the global coronavirus pandemic, Reuters reports. The smoke can cause respiratory problems, which could result in added complications for COVID-19 patients.
""It's a bad sign, but what really is going to count is what happens from now on,"" Philip Fearnside, an ecologist at Brazil's National Institute of Amazonian Research, said, according to Reuters.
Fearnside said rising deforestation is a concern. With deforestation, fires are usually set to clear land when trees are cut down to create pastures.
Preliminary INPE data from the first five months of 2020 shows deforestation is up 34 percent, Reuters says."
flood,"Storm Saudel bears down on flooded central Vietnam Vietnamese and international weather agencies say Storm Saudel is heading toward central Vietnam and flood-hit provinces from Ha Tinh to Quang Tri. At 7 a.m. Friday it lay centered around 320 kilometers east of Vietnam’s Paracel Islands in the East Sea, known internationally as the South China Sea, with winds of up to 150 kph, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.  In the next 24 hours it is forecast to move west at a speed of 15 kph and lie north of the Paracel Islands at around 7 a.m. Saturday and around 240 kilometers from the coast of Ha Tinh-Quang Tri provinces by 4 a.m. Sunday. By then its winds will fall to a maximum of 90 kph.  It is expected to weaken into a tropical depression by the time it approaches the coast of Ha Tinh - Quang Tri on Sunday night, and weaken further into a low pressure area.  A U.S. Navy notification said the storm packs winds of 145 kph and would weaken into a tropical depression on Sunday. The Japan Meteorological Agency expected its wind speed to fall to 80 kph on Sunday.  They all forecast provinces from Ha Tinh to Quang Tri, now reeling from prolonged heavy rains, historic flooding and deadly landslides, to be affected by the storm.  For more than two weeks the central region has suffered damage described by government officials as the worst in five years.  At least 117 people had been killed and 21 others were missing as of Thursday."
other,"Fuel group inflation declined for the fifth month in a row in April mainly on account of a fall in the inflation of liquefied petroleum gas in line with international prices, and electricity. However, inflation in other major items of fuel such as firewood and chips, dung cake, kerosene and coal inched up. Inflation in the transport and communication sub-group accelerated due to the firming up of international crude oil prices, even though the domestic pass-through to petrol and diesel was incomplete. Inflation also picked up in clothing, household goods and services, health, recreation, education, and personal care and effects.The May 2018 round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s survey of households reported a significant rise in households¡¯ inflation expectations of 90 basis points (bps) and 130 bps, respectively, for three-month and one-year ahead horizons. Manufacturing firms polled in the Reserve Bank¡¯s IOS reported input price pressures and an increase in selling prices in Q1:2018-19. Firms polled for the manufacturing PMI in May also showed a sharp increase in input and output prices. Farm inputs and industrial raw material costs have risen sequentially. Wage pressures in the rural sector moderated; however, those in the organised sectors remained firm.Liquidity in the system remained generally in surplus during April-May 2018. During April, the Reserve Bank absorbed surplus liquidity of _496 billion on a daily net average basis due to increased government spending, especially in the second half of the month. Reflecting easy liquidity conditions, the weighted average call rate (WACR) softened to 5.89 per cent in April (from 5.96 per cent in March). However, surplus liquidity in the system moderated considerably in the first half of May and the system moved into deficit in the third week of May mainly due to inflows on account of the goods and services tax (GST). The Reserve Bank conducted an open market operation purchase auction on May 17, 2018 to inject liquidity of _100 billion into the system. The system again turned into surplus in the last week of May reflecting mainly the payment of food subsidies. Surplus liquidity absorbed under the LAF on a daily net average basis declined to _142 billion in May. The WACR in May at 5.88 per cent remained broadly at the April 2018 level.India¡¯s exports grew in April 2018 after a marginal dip in the preceding month, supported mainly by non-oil exports, particularly engineering goods and chemicals. Import growth decelerated sequentially in April 2018; a significant decline in imports of gold as well as pearl and precious stones more than offset the impact of rising crude oil prices. Nevertheless, the trade deficit expanded in March and April from its level a year ago. External financing remained comfortable in 2017-18. While net foreign direct investment in 2017-18 was broadly comparable with the previous year, net foreign portfolio flows were stronger due to a sharp turnaround in debt inflows. However, foreign portfolio investors withdrew US$ 6.7 billion on a net basis from the domestic capital market in 2018-19 (up to June 4) reflecting volatility in global financial markets. India¡¯s foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 412 billion on June 1, 2018."
wildfires,"The fire began in the early hours of Saturday and has been fuelled by gale force winds.
Authorities said that by Monday the blaze had destroyed about 7,000 hectares (16,000 acres) of forest and farmland.
Residents of nine villages and hamlets were evacuated from their homes over the weekend as the fire approached.
Chios lies north-east of the capital, Athens, off the coast of Turkey.
The island is famous for its production of mastic, a natural, gum-like resin with a distinctive flavour produced only by trees on certain sections of the island.
Used as a natural chewing gum, a cooking spice and for pharmaceutical and cooking purposes, mastic resin is a major source of income for the islanders.
The strong winds were hampering efforts to extinguish the fires, despite the presence of several hundred firefighters, soldiers and volunteers, as well as firefighting planes and helicopters.
Wildfires are common during Greece's long, hot summers, though some are believed to be started on purpose.
A further five forest and brush fires broke out on Monday across Greece, the Associated Press news agency reports, while fire crews continued to fight six fires already burning in other parts of the country.

drought,"Almost half of India _ an area home to more than 500 million people _ is facing drought-like conditions while a blistering heatwave has killed dozens of people in the impoverished eastern state of Bihar.
As the country suffers its lowest rainfall ahead of a monsoon season in more than six decades, the western state of Maharashtra witnesses its worst drought in 47 years, forcing many to leave their lands and take shelter in relief camps, as they wait for monsoon rains.
Reporting from Beed in Maharashtra, Al Jazeera’s Elizabeth Puranam said people walk in intense heat, sometimes for kilometres, only to find a small amount of muddy water at the bottom of a well.
Asha Pawar said she collects about five pots _ or 100 litres _ of water a day for herself and her four children. The state government provides water tankers, but Pawar said they only come every four or five days.
“We have no arrangements for water. We keep getting it from whatever source is available. If nothing is available, we climb down the well for drinking water,” Pawar told Al Jazeera.
“My daughter fell in the well when she went to fetch water. A passer-by rescued her when he heard her scream.”
Elsewhere in Beed, farmers have left their land and moved to nearby relief camps, where the government provides fodder and water to keep their cattle alive.
“There is no water left in the Beed area. It used to rain by June 7, but there are still no signs of rains. Last year, we had a drought situation. This year is worse. If it doesn’t rain again this year, we have to leave our village,” said farmer Navnath Kadam, who has already spent four months at a relief camp."
other,"On the supply side, growth of gross value added (GVA) at basic prices accelerated in Q1, underpinned by double-digit expansion in manufacturing activity which was robust and generalised across firm sizes. Agricultural growth also picked up, supported by robust growth in production of rice, pulses and coarse cereals alongside a sustained expansion in livestock products, forestry and fisheries. In contrast, services sector growth moderated somewhat, largely on account of a high base. Construction activity, however, maintained strong pace for the second consecutive quarter.The fourth advance estimates of agricultural production for 2017-18 released in August placed foodgrains production at a high of 284.8 million tonnes, 1.9 per cent higher than the third advance estimates (released in May 2018) and 3.5 per cent higher than the final estimates for the previous year. The progress of the south-west monsoon has been marked by uneven spatial and temporal distribution, with an overall deficit of 9 per cent in precipitation. However, the first advance estimates of production of major kharif crops for 2018-19 have placed foodgrains production at 141.6 million tonnes, 0.6 per cent higher than last year¡¯s level. The live storage in major reservoirs (as on September 27) rose to 76 per cent of the full capacity, which was 17 per cent higher than last year and 5 per cent higher than the average of the last 10 years. This bodes well for the rabi sowing season."
drought,"Amid a precarious security situation in Afghanistan, the worst drought in recent history, that hit two out of three provinces in Afghanistan in July, has destabilised the lives of tens of thousands of civilians, some of whom have already been displaced.
The UN has predicted that over two million people are expected to become severely food insecure in the coming period.
The West Region of conflict-stricken Afghanistan has been hardest hit by the drought, and over 60,000 people have been displaced to Herat and Badghis provinces, as a result. Families that fled to Herat are living in dire conditions in makeshift shelters, where they are exposed to the scorching sun and summer temperatures of over 40 degrees Celsius. Many families are subsisting on a single meal a day. Many get by on just bread and water.
Herat has become the closest refuge for about 60,000 people, who have been displaced from their homes due to the drought. Conflict has also prompted many to flee their homes to the relative safety of province. Over 1,700 civilians were killed in Afghanistan during the first half of 2018, according to the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA). It is the highest recorded number, compared to the same periods for the past decade. The combination of drought and conflict has made tens of thousands of families destitute. They live amid precarity and with few long term prospects or means of regaining stability.
Among the most vulnerable are women and children. Many of the children show visible signs of malnutrition and illness, including skin diseases and eye infections due to dust and the hot weather."
other,"GFCE continued to support aggregate demand in Q1. The fiscal position of the central government showed an improvement in terms of key deficit indicators, as per cent of budget estimates (BE), during April-August 2018-19 as growth in revenue receipts exceeded that of expenditure (Table III.2). Tax revenues grew by 7.5 per cent, supported by higher income tax collections (Charts III.13a and b).Notwithstanding month-over-month fluctuations, the overall indirect tax base has expanded. Ongoing simplification of procedures and rationalisation of GST rates have encouraged voluntary compliance, especially in the business-to-business segment and small enterprises. Many registrants under the GST network (GSTN) were those who fell below the GST threshold but nevertheless chose to be a part of the GST. Similarly, more than 50 percent of those who could have chosen to opt for the simpler composition scheme chose to register under the regular GST scheme.3 States¡¯ own tax revenues, comprising mainly their collection under the state goods and services tax (SGST), have stabilised in recent months, though there is some uncertainty relating to the sharing of revenues from the integrated goods and services tax (IGST) between the centre and states and the transfer under GST compensation cess.4 Furthermore, non-tax revenues have shown a marked improvement for centre.On the expenditure front, accounts for April-August 2018-19 reveal a marked moderation in revenue expenditure mainly due to lower subsidy outgo. The quality of expenditure improved, with growth in capital expenditure _ at 20.6 per cent _ outpacing revenue expenditure. As regards states, the share of revenue expenditure in their total expenditure was estimated slightly lower at 83 per cent in their BE for 2018-19, though still higher than in 2015-16 and 2016-17 (Table III.3).There is a positive relationship between indebtedness of states (debt/GSDP) and their respective shares of revenue expenditure in total expenditure. This relationship is stronger in the case of non-special category states than in special category states5 (Chart III.14). States with high interest burden (higher interest payment as per cent of revenue expenditure) find it more difficult to control their revenue expenditure, thereby putting a strain on the quality of expenditure."
earthquake,"Japan jolted by magnitude 6.8 earthquake; no serious injuries reported, no tsunami alert An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.8, revised up from an earlier estimate of 6.6, jolted northeast Japan on Saturday, shaking buildings 400 kilometres away in Tokyo and raising the possibility of landslides closer to the epicentre. No tsunami alert was issued after the quake, which struck at 10.27 am Japan time (0127 GMT) off the coast of Miyagi prefecture at a depth of 51 kilometres (32 miles), the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) said. The JMA earlier estimated its depth at 60 kilometres. There were no reports of serious injuries caused by the quake, but the JMA warned of the potential for strong aftershocks for about a week, as well as the heightened risk of landslides. Tokyo Electric Power (9501.T) reported there were no issues at the devastated Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, wrecked by a massive earthquake and tsunami in northeast Japan in March 2011, and sited some 105 kilometres from the epicentre of Saturday's quake. Likewise it said there were no issues at the Fukushima Daini facility, just to the south of the wrecked plant. Closer to the epicentre, there were no issues at the Onagawa nuclear station, according to operator Tohoku Electric Power Co Inc (9506.T). Bullet train services throughout northern Japan were suspended for several hours, but had resumed by late afternoon. The coast off northeast Japan has been hit by multiple earthquakes in recent months, including a magnitude 7.2 quake in March and a similar sized one in February - both said by scientists to be aftershocks from the magnitude 9 quake a decade ago that ravaged Fukushima Daiichi and was one of the strongest temblors on record. Eneos Holdings Inc, (5020.T) Japan's biggest refining company, said its Sendai refinery, also located close to the epicentre, automatically shut down as the quake struck. Engineers were making checks after confirming there were no injuries, it said. The 145,000 barrels per day refinery had only restarted in April after being damaged by the February earthquake. That quake knocked out one fifth of Japan's refining capacity."
other,"Since the MPC¡¯s meeting during June 2-4, 2021 the pace of global recovery appears to be moderating with the resurgence of infections in several parts of the world, especially from the delta variant of the virus. In June and July, global purchasing managers¡¯ indices (PMIs) slipped from the highs scaled in May. The growing consensus is that the recovery is occurring on a diverging two-track mode. Countries that are ahead in vaccination and have been able to provide or maintain policy stimulus are rebounding strongly. Growth in other economies remains subdued and vulnerable to new waves of infections. There has been a slowing of momentum in global trade volumes in Q2:2021, with elevated shipping charges and logistics costs posing headwinds.There has been a considerable hardening of commodity prices, particularly of crude oil. The latest agreement within the Organisation of Petroleum Countries (OPEC) plus to raise oil production for a likely restoration of output to the pre-pandemic levels by September 2022 imparted transient softening to spot and future crude prices from the recent peak in early July. Headline inflation has ratcheted up in several advanced economies (AEs) as well as most emerging market economies (EMEs), prompting a few central banks in EMEs to tighten monetary policy. In contrast, sovereign bond yields have softened across AEs as markets seem to have acquiesced to the views of central banks that inflation is largely transitory. In EMEs, bond yields remain relatively high on inflation concerns and country-specific factors. In the foreign exchange market, EME currencies have depreciated in the wake of portfolio outflows since mid-June as risk appetite ebbed, while the US dollar has strengthened."
drought,"A newly released study warns of problems as the state’s population grows from 20 million to 35 million, and as water consumption jumps from 5 billion gallons a day to 8 billion by 2070.
The report, called Water 2070, was jointly authored by the state Department of Agriculture, the University of Florida and 1,000 Friends of Florida, a nonprofit geared toward sustainability.
“If we continue as we are, we’re going to have some severe problems, some severe shortages,” said University of Florida professor Peggy Carr, one of the researchers who contributed to the study.
Much of Southwest Florida is in the midst of a severe drought that has persisted for months. It’s left wells dry in Lehigh Acres and prompted Cape Coral to restrict lawn watering to only one day a week. It’s also helped contribute to the state’s worst wildfire season in at least six years.
The issue isn’t affecting Cape Coral’s drinking water, which comes from a different source than its irrigation supply. The city estimates it has enough drinking water to last 15-20 years.
But if Cape Coral or other Southwest Florida municipalities need to turn to a new drinking water source, the next closest option is the Avon Park aquifer. It could cost an average of four to five times more per household to bring water in from there, Cape Coral Water Production Manager Andrew Fenske said."
other,"Monetary policy is guided by a monetary programme, which is premised on the economic growth and inflation targets provided by the National Treasury. Monetary policy decisions are made by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). The MPC meets at least once every two months and reviews data and analysis from various sources including the Central Bank Departments enabling it to decide on any action to maintain or vary its stance.The daily monetary policy activities are undertaken by the Monetary Policy Management Committee, which meets at least three times a week.The Central Bank has several tools that it can use to counter changes in the market and influence price stability:Commercial banks in Kenya are required by law to keep a specified proportion of their total deposits at the Central Bank. This proportion of deposits is called the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR), and when the Central Bank needs to significantly adjust the amount of money in the market, it can increase or decrease the ratio.The CRR deposits are held in the CBK at no interest. The CRR is currently set at 5.25 percent of the total of a bank¡¯s domestic and foreign currency deposit liabilities. To facilitate commercial banks¡¯ liquidity management, commercial banks are currently required to maintain their CRR based on a daily average level from the 15th of the previous month to the 14th of the current month and not to fall below a CRR of 3 percent on any day."
drought,"The spectre of drought looms over the country almost as a certainty like the annual floods. This year large swathes of almost all central Indian states are reeling under severe water scarcity. Much beyond the news reports, statistics and the weather graphs, the drought is a calamity that unfolds in the anguish of people struggling for water. India Today sent its team of photographers deep into the drought-affected districts of the country to capture the widespread severity of the situation - what they have photographed goes beyond the routine imagery of cracked earth and dried river beds - these are images that show how the drought is lived through.
"
other,"Although the recession officially began more than two years ago, U.S. economic activity contracted particularly sharply following the intensification of the global financial crisis in the fall of 2008. Concerted efforts by the Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department, and other U.S. authorities to stabilize the financial system, together with highly stimulative monetary and fiscal policies, helped arrest the decline and are supporting a nascent economic recovery. Indeed, the U.S. economy expanded at about a 4 percent annual rate during the second half of last year. A significant portion of that growth, however, can be attributed to the progress firms made in working down unwanted inventories of unsold goods, which left them more willing to increase production. As the impetus provided by the inventory cycle is temporary, and as the fiscal support for economic growth likely will diminish later this year, a sustained recovery will depend on continued growth in private-sector final demand for goods and services.Private final demand does seem to be growing at a moderate pace, buoyed in part by a general improvement in financial conditions. In particular, consumer spending has recently picked up, reflecting gains in real disposable income and household wealth and tentative signs of stabilization in the labor market. Business investment in equipment and software has risen significantly. And international trade--supported by a recovery in the economies of many of our trading partners--is rebounding from its deep contraction of a year ago. However, starts of single-family homes, which rose noticeably this past spring, have recently been roughly flat, and commercial construction is declining sharply, reflecting poor fundamentals and continued difficulty in obtaining financing.The job market has been hit especially hard by the recession, as employers reacted to sharp sales declines and concerns about credit availability by deeply cutting their workforces in late 2008 and in 2009. Some recent indicators suggest the deterioration in the labor market is abating: Job losses have slowed considerably, and the number of full-time jobs in manufacturing rose modestly in January. Initial claims for unemployment insurance have continued to trend lower, and the temporary services industry, often considered a bellwether for the employment outlook, has been expanding steadily since October. Notwithstanding these positive signs, the job market remains quite weak, with the unemployment rate near 10 percent and job openings scarce. Of particular concern, because of its long-term implications for workers' skills and wages, is the increasing incidence of long-term unemployment; indeed, more than 40 percent of the unemployed have been out of work six months or more, nearly double the share of a year ago."

But chances are you've thought less about the deadly and economically destructive consequences of a slower-moving culprit: drought.
Repeated droughts around the world are destroying enough farm produce to feed 81 million people for a year and are four times more costly for economies than floods, the World Bank found in a new study. Beyond hindering food production, erratic rainfall patterns and longer droughts as the climate changes are causing a host of problems for cities, including businesses.

flood,"39 dead, scores missing in floods, landslides in Vietnam, Cambodia HANOI/PHNOM PENH • Nearly 40 people have died in Vietnam and Cambodia and scores more were missing, including rescuers, due to prolonged heavy rain and flash flooding as tropical storm Nangka edged towards the Vietnamese coast yesterday.  Heavy rain since early this month has caused deadly floods and landslides in several provinces in central Vietnam and displaced thousands of people in western Cambodia, officials and state media said.  The floods are expected to worsen over the coming days, with tropical storm Nangka forecast to dump more rain as it makes landfall in Vietnam today.  Nangka, packing wind speeds of up to 100kmh, will trigger heavy rain of up to 400mm in parts of northern and central Vietnam from today through Friday, its weather agency said.  Ongoing flooding has killed at least 28 people in Vietnam, and 11 in Cambodia, where almost 25,000 houses and 84,000ha of crops have been damaged, according to local media.  The Vietnamese disaster management authorities said more than 130,000 houses have been affected."

The Caldor Fire more than doubled in size by Wednesday morning to cover more than 53,772 acres, burning through Grizzly Flats and leveling at least 50 homes in the hamlet of about 1,200 people east of Sacramento, according to the Associated Press. At least two civilians have been injured in the fire so far.
The El Dorado County sheriff’s office has ordered evacuations for residents on both sides of Highway 50, from Camino on the west to Ice House Road on the east. Those towns include Cedar Grove, Pollock Pines, Fresh Pond and Pacific House.
Weather officials meanwhile extended a Red Flag warning for the region through 8 p.m. Thursday, anticipating extremely dry humidity levels and big wind gusts. The warning covers much of Northern California and reaches down into the Bay Area’s North Bay mountains and East Bay hills.
Fickle winds and smoke swirling above the flames have made it “very challenging” to predict the weather, said National Weather Service meteorologist Bill Rasch. Although southwesterly winds fanned the flames toward populated communities Tuesday, they switched directions and were largely expected to originate from the east Wednesday, he said.
Gusts were forecast to reach about 25 mph over the Caldor Fire itself, NWS said, but could top 50 mph along Northern California’s highest ridges and hilltops."
other,"Large-scale purchases of longer-term securities are a less familiar means of providing monetary policy stimulus than reducing the federal funds rate, but the two approaches affect the economy in similar ways. Conventional monetary policy easing works by lowering market expectations for the future path of short-term interest rates, which, in turn, reduces the current level of longer-term interest rates and contributes to both lower borrowing costs and higher asset prices. This easing in financial conditions bolsters household and business spending and thus increases economic activity. By comparison, the Federal Reserve's purchases of longer-term securities, by lowering term premiums, put downward pressure directly on longer-term interest rates. By easing conditions in credit and financial markets, these actions encourage spending by households and businesses through essentially the same channels as conventional monetary policy.A wide range of market indicators supports the view that the Federal Reserve's recent actions have been effective. For example, since August, when we announced our policy of reinvesting principal payments on agency debt and agency MBS and indicated that we were considering more securities purchases, equity prices have risen significantly, volatility in the equity market has fallen, corporate bond spreads have narrowed, and inflation compensation as measured in the market for inflation-indexed securities has risen to historically more normal levels. Yields on 5- to 10-year nominal Treasury securities initially declined markedly as markets priced in prospective Fed purchases; these yields subsequently rose, however, as investors became more optimistic about economic growth and as traders scaled back their expectations of future securities purchases. All of these developments are what one would expect to see when monetary policy becomes more accommodative, whether through conventional or less conventional means. Interestingly, these market responses are almost identical to those that occurred during the earlier episode of policy easing, notably in the months following our March 2009 announcement. In addition, as I already noted, most forecasters see the economic outlook as having improved since our actions in August; downside risks to the recovery have receded, and the risk of deflation has become negligible. Of course, it is too early to make any firm judgment about how much of the recent improvement in the outlook can be attributed to monetary policy, but these developments are consistent with it having had a beneficial effect.My colleagues and I continue to regularly review the asset purchase program in light of incoming information, and we will adjust it as needed to promote the achievement of our mandate from the Congress of maximum employment and stable prices. We also continue to plan for the eventual exit from unusually accommodative monetary policies and the normalization of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. We have all the tools we need to achieve a smooth and effective exit at the appropriate time. Currently, because the Federal Reserve's asset purchases are settled through the banking system, depository institutions hold a very high level of reserve balances with the Federal Reserve. Even if bank reserves remain high, however, our ability to pay interest on reserve balances will allow us to put upward pressure on short-term market interest rates and thus to tighten monetary policy when required. Moreover, we have developed and tested additional tools that will allow us to drain or immobilize bank reserves to the extent needed to tighten the relationship between the interest rate paid on reserves and other short-term interest rates.5 If necessary, the Federal Reserve can also drain reserves by ceasing the reinvestment of principal payments on the securities it holds or by selling some of those securities in the open market. The FOMC remains unwaveringly committed to price stability and, in particular, to achieving a rate of inflation in the medium term that is consistent with the Federal Reserve's mandate."

earthquake,"AS SO often with earthquakes, this one started almost imperceptibly. It was lunchtime, and people in Tokyo are apt to take tremors lightly. It took just a frozen heartbeat, though, for that to change. One of us was seated at a coffee shop along a huge slab of oak that sat 14. It shook so violently, people raced outside. Another of us was next to a busy kitchen; metal pots shook, then crashed off the shelves, and with the noise diners came rushing up from tables in the basement and out into the streets. Within minutes, Tokyo's narrow alleys were choked with people, some visibly shocked, most eerily quiet, listening to the clanking power lines overhead, and quite understandably bereft without mobile-phone signals. As I walked onto one of the shopping boulevards of Omote-Sando, a sea of evacuees from the buildings that run along it let out a roar of fear when a second—and then a third—aftershock hit. As cars swayed, and trees lurched overhead, you could feel the power of the beast writhing underneath Japan.
The country has long prepared for something like this—and it showed. Friends quickly offered advice. Stay in open spaces; when back at home, fill up your bath and your rice cooker, so that there is plenty of food and water in reserve. Though phone signals were mostly dead (apparently to leave bandwidth for emergency services), the internet functioned. That meant e-mail and Skype worked, and Facebook and Twitter conveyed news, tips and just the sort of offbeat information that is uplifting in the face of adversity (according to one Facebook rumour, this being Japan, airlines are generously offering cheap flights for anyone wanting to leave the country). Schoolchildren, benefitting from years of drills, looked calmer than some of their teachers."
other,"With a view to increasing the focus of liquidity measures on revival of activity in specific sectors that have both backward and forward linkages and having multiplier effects on growth, the RBI had announced the TLTRO on Tap Scheme on October 9, 2020 which is available up to March 31, 2021. In addition to the five sectors announced under the scheme on October 21, 2020, 26 stressed sectors identified by the Kamath Committee were also brought within the ambit of sectors eligible under on tap TLTRO on December 4, 2020. Liquidity availed by banks under the scheme is to be deployed in corporate bonds, commercial paper, and non-convertible debentures issued by entities in these sectors. The liquidity availed under the scheme can also be used to extend bank loans and advances to these sectors. Investments made by banks under this facility can be classified as held to maturity (HTM) even above the 25 per cent of total investment permitted to be included in the HTM portfolio. All exposures under this facility are exempted from reckoning under the large exposure framework (LEF). Given that NBFCs are well recognised conduits for reaching out last mile credit and act as a force multiplier in expanding credit to various sectors, it is now proposed to provide funds from banks under the TLTRO on Tap scheme to NBFCs for incremental lending to these sectors.To help banks tide over the disruption caused by COVID-19, the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of all banks was reduced by 100 basis points to 3.0 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) effective from the reporting fortnight beginning March 28, 2020. The dispensation was available for a period of one year ending March 26, 2021. On a review of monetary and liquidity conditions, it has been decided to gradually restore the CRR in two phases in a non-disruptive manner. Banks would now be required to maintain the CRR at 3.5 per cent of NDTL effective from the reporting fortnight beginning March 27, 2021 and 4.0 per cent of NDTL effective from fortnight beginning May 22, 2021.On March 27, 2020 banks were allowed to avail of funds under the marginal standing facility (MSF) by dipping into the Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) up to an additional one per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL), i.e., cumulatively up to 3 per cent of NDTL. This facility, which was initially available up to June 30, 2020 was later extended in phases up to March 31, 2021 providing comfort to banks on their liquidity requirements and also to enable them to meet their Liquidity Coverage ratio (LCR) requirements. This dispensation provides increased access to funds to the extent of _1.53 lakh crore and qualifies as high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) for the LCR. With a view to providing comfort to banks on their liquidity requirements, it has now been decided to continue with the MSF relaxation for a further period of six months, i.e., up to September 30, 2021."
earthquake,"A powerful 8.9-magnitude earthquake hit Japan on Friday (March 11) at 1446 local time (0546 GMT), unleashing massive tsunami waves that crashed into Japan's eastern coast of Honshu, the largest and main island of Japan, resulting in widespread damage and destruction. According to the Government of Japan (GoJ) as of Saturday (March 12), at least 464 people have been reported dead and some 725 people are reported to be missing, the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported. The GoJ's chief spokesperson said the death toll could exceed 1,000. Local media put the death toll closer to 1,300 people. As initial assessments come in it is expected that the death toll will rise due to the extensive devastation along the coastline and majority of the casualties are likely to be the result of the tsunami. The earthquake sparked widespread tsunami warnings across the Pacific that stretched from Japan to North and South America. According to the US Geological Survey (USGS), the shallow quake struck at a depth of six miles (10 km) (20 km deep according to Japan's Meteorological Agency), around 80 miles (125 km) off the eastern coast of Japan, and 240 miles (380 km) northeast of Tokyo. It was reportedly the largest recorded quake in Japan's history and the fifth largest in the world since 1900. The quake was also felt in Japan's capital city, Tokyo, located hundreds of miles from the epicenter and was also felt as far away as the Chinese capital Beijing, some 1,500 miles away. There have been at least 79 aftershocks recorded and 16 of them have been greater than 6.0 magnitude, including one recorded at 7.1 magnitude. According to the UN, the continuing aftershocks and tsunami are hampering rescue efforts. Up to 3 meter high waves reportedly continue to hit the coast. GoJ officials also ordered new evacuations in several coastal areas, sending residents to higher ground.
Earthquakes had affected the region recently, including a 7.3-magnitude quake Wednesday (March 9) that did not cause any damage. Japan's worst previous quake was an 8.3 magnitude quake in 1923 that left some 143,000 dead. More recently, the 7.2-magnitude earthquake in Kobe in 1995 left some 6,400 dead."
other,"Growth of Australia's major trading partners (MTPs) was around its long-run average in 2014. The US economy continued to strengthen, growing above its trend pace over the second half of 2014. In China, economic growth eased a little but was still very close to the authorities' target for 2014. Growth of investment and industrial production in China _ which contribute significantly to the demand for commodities, including iron ore _ have moderated over the past year or so, partly because of weak conditions in the residential property market. In Japan, economic activity has been weaker than expected since the increase in the consumption tax in April last year, but growth looks to have resumed in the December quarter. In the rest of east Asia, the pace of growth slowed a little over 2014. Economic activity in the euro area remains subdued.Australia's MTP growth is expected to continue at around its pace of recent years in 2015 as a number of effects offset each other. Growth in China is expected to be a little lower in 2015, while growth in the US economy is expected to pick up further. The significant fall in oil prices, which has largely reflected an increase in global production, represents a sizeable positive supply shock for the global economy and is expected to provide a stimulus to growth for Australia's MTPs. The fall in oil prices is also putting downward pressure on global prices of goods and services. Other commodity prices have also declined in the past three months, though by much less than oil prices. This includes iron ore and, to a lesser extent, base metals prices. Prices of Australia's liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports are generally linked to the price of oil and are expected to fall in the period ahead. The Australian terms of trade are expected to be lower as a result of these price developments, notwithstanding the benefit from the lower price of oil, of which Australia is a net importer."
drought,"Djibouti is one of the smallest countries on the African continent. Situated between Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia, the total population is approximately 820,000 people. These factors alone make it an easy country to overlook in the context of the current drought. Next to the emergency crises in Kenya and Somalia, the needs of the drought-affected population may seem insignificant. Yet this is not a sufficient reason to neglect Djiboutians who are asking for help.
The IFRC together with the Djibouti Red Crescent have been undergoing an assessment throughout the country, and the needs are quite real. In Garabtisan village, northern Djibouti, there are approximately 1500 people - including 300 children - who have been facing a drought for the past five years.
“There is no public school for our children”, explained Madina, a mother of nine children. “We used to have a Koranic school, but the last wind storm knocked down the tree where lessons took place. Now, there is no place for children to learn.” It is a symbolic loss for this community who are on the brink of an emergency crisis.
In Garabtisan village, women such as Madina have only 40 litres of water for a period of 2 to 3 days to support the needs of an entire family. The nearest water source requires that women walk the distance of 23km, or they wait for water delivery from the military stationed nearby. But with a community of 1500 people, it is simply impossible for the military to adequately service the needs of Garabtisan village without support. In addition to high food prices, geographical isolation and the depletion of livestock, their situation is increasingly desperate.
Access to health care is another critical problem for women and children in Garabtisan village. When a child falls ill, the community is unable to respond. Each month there are approximately 6 to 7 births, with a loss of 2 to 3 children. The mobile health clinic provided by the Ministry of Health faces significant logistical challenges to reach the community as needed.
Yet the people of Garabtisan have dignity. Their cultural traditions practice basic hygiene such as washing children’s hands before eating, or defecating away from the home. Madina clearly wants to be a good mother, and meet the basic needs of her children.
The Djibouti Red Crescent and IFRC recognise the clear needs in drought-affected areas such as Garabtisan village. The Government of Djibouti has claimed there are 120,000 in need of critical assistance in rural areas. This indicates that 1 out of 8 persons are in need of emergency aid.
However the response cannot be successful by one agency or government ministry alone. Joint action is needed in Djibouti, in order to meet the challenges of drought-affected communities. Although the figures may be comparatively small to the rest of the Horn of Africa, women and mothers in desperate need, such as Madina, should be enough to take action."

He came to Germany from Togo in 1995. Initially, he says, integration proved challenging -- ""we didn't have a lot of interaction with people"" -- but playing football provided a place where he could be himself.
""It was the first time where I had a smile on my face,"" adds Zinsou. ""You are working hard everywhere to be part of society, but on the pitch, was always the moment where the language didn't play any role.""
Zinsou is speaking to CNN Sport from his home in Munich. He talks proudly of doing well at school, being married to his German wife and father to two children. ""Society ... gave me opportunities,"" he says.
Football still plays an important part in Zinsou's life -- he's Youth Coordinator for German football club Türkgücü Munich.
""My mission in life is teaching football,"" says Zinsou as he reflects on his role of overseeing Türkgücü's various youth teams. He sees that mission as not just developing talented footballers, but also teaching them valuable life skills."
drought,"An estimated 45 million people are threatened with hunger by a severe drought strangling wide stretches of southern Africa.
Emergency food deliveries are planned for parts of South Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe and other countries hard hit by a combination of low rainfall and high temperatures.
“We are witnessing millions of already poor people facing extreme food insecurity and exhausting their reserves because of compounding climate shocks that hit already vulnerable communities hardest. They need help urgently,” said Nellie Nyang’wa, southern Africa director for the international aid agency, Oxfam.
“The scale of the drought devastation across southern Africa is staggering.”
Parts of Zimbabwe have had the lowest rainfall since 1981, contributing to making more than 5.5 million at risk of extreme food insecurity, Oxfam said in a report released Thursday.
Zambia’s rich maize-growing area has been hit hard and exports are now banned; 2.3 million people there are food-insecure, according to Oxfam and the Zambia Red Cross. The drought is also worsening food availability in Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, Madagascar and Namibia, Oxfam said.
Southern Africa has received normal rainfall in just one of the past five growing seasons, which particularly hits the small-scale farmers who depend on rain for their crops, the U.N. World Food Program said last week. The U.N. food agencies plan to distribute emergency food aid to 11 million people in the coming months.
Two cataclysmic cyclones hit Mozambique, Zimbabwe and other southern African countries early this year, wiping out crops of maize and other staple crops. Without normal rainfall, subsistence farmers are hard-pressed to recover from the destruction caused by the tropical storms.
“The successive mixture of drought and flooding has been catastrophic for many communities. In most of the affected areas there isn’t enough drinking water, which means that people and animals — both livestock and wildlife — are having to use the same water points,” said Kaitano Chungu, Secretary General of the Zambia Red Cross.
“This is unacceptable as it exposes people to diseases and creates a heightened risk of animal attacks.”
Some families in the worst-affected areas are surviving the food shortage by eating wild fruits and roots, Chungu said.
The drought has also affected the region’s wildlife. At least 105 elephants have died in Zimbabwe as a result of lack of water and vegetation, according to Zimbabwe’s National Parks."
other,"Growth in the Australian economy has slowed and inflation remains low. Subdued growth in household income and the adjustment in the housing market are affecting consumer spending and residential construction. Despite this, the labour market is performing reasonably well, with the unemployment rate steady at around 5 per cent. Underlying inflation has been lower than expected, at 1_ per cent over the year to the March quarter, with pricing pressures subdued across much of the economy.GDP growth is expected to be around 2_ per cent over both 2019 and 2020. This is lower than previously forecast, reflecting the revised outlook for household consumption spending and dwelling activity. Stronger growth in exports and, further out, work on new mining investment projects are expected to support growth. Forecasts for inflation have also been revised lower. Trimmed mean inflation is expected to be around 1_ per cent over 2019 and then increase gradually to 2 per cent in 2020 and a touch above 2 per cent by early 2021. In the near term, CPI inflation is expected to run a little above the rate for trimmed mean inflation, driven by the recent increase in petrol prices."

The Disaster and Emergency Management Authority of Turkey (AFAD) said the dog ""Ares"" was rescued from the rubble of an apartment building. Ares was reported to be exhausted but in good condition. The dog was handed over to its owner Gizem Ileri, who was pulled out from the rubble 10 hours after the tremor. The 6.6-magnitude quake hit the Aegean Sea off the Seferihisar district of Izmir on Friday. Death toll in the earthquake has risen to 85, the AFAD said in the latest statement, adding that a total of 994 people were wounded in the tremor."

The five women, along with one of their partners, were transported on a commercial flight to Mexico on Monday, funded by different organizations, Martha Delgado, undersecretary for multilateral affairs and human rights at Mexico's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in a press conference on Tuesday.
A frantic Western evacuation operation at Kabul airport has picked up pace after the Taliban said Tuesday that they were no longer allowing the evacuation of Afghans. Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden made clear he aims to stick with his August 31 deadline to withdraw troops from the country.
Many of those fleeing the country since the Taliban took over have been educated people, especially women. The last time the Taliban ruled, women were banned from working and forbidden to attend schools and universities.
""Following the tradition of solidarity and with the feminist foreign policy of the Mexican government, we have carried out many diplomatic efforts to create a safe passage that would allow us to bring them to Mexico,"" Delgado said, ""We give you the warmest welcome to Mexico.""
The women will have a humanitarian visa for up to 180 days, after which they may have the option of an extension, Delgado said.
An institution based in Mexico, which was not named for security purposes, offered accommodation, food, and basic services at no cost for the team members, Delgado said."
other,"On the domestic front, economic activity had started to recover from the lows of April-May following the uneven re-opening of some parts of the country in June; however, surges of fresh infections have forced re-clamping of lockdowns in several cities and states. Consequently, several high frequency indicators have levelled off.The agricultural sector has emerged as a bright spot. Its prospects have strengthened on the back of good spatial and temporal progress of the south-west monsoon. The cumulative monsoon rainfall was 1 per cent below the long-period average (LPA) up to August 5, 2020. Spurred by the expanding precipitation, the total area sown under kharif crops on July 31 was 5.9 per cent higher than the normal area measured by the average over the period 2014-15 to 2018-19. As on July 30, 2020, the live storage in major reservoirs was 41 per cent of the full reservoir level (FRL), which bodes well for the rabi season. These developments have had a salutary effect on rural demand as reflected in fertiliser production and sales of tractors, motorcycles and fast-moving consumer goods.The pace of contraction of industrial production, measured by the index of industrial production (IIP), moderated to (-) 34.7 per cent in May from (-) 57.6 per cent a month ago, with the easing of lockdowns in different parts of the country. All manufacturing sub-sectors, except pharmaceuticals, remained in negative territory. The output of core industries in June contracted for the fourth successive month though with a considerable moderation. The Reserve Bank¡¯s business assessment index (BAI) for Q1:2020-21 hit its lowest mark in the survey¡¯s history. The manufacturing PMI remained in contraction, shrinking further to 46.0 in July from 47.2 in the preceding month.High frequency indicators of services sector activity for May-June indicate signs of a modest resumption of economic activity, especially in rural areas, although at levels lower than a year ago. Notably, the decline in passenger vehicle sales moderated to (-) 49.6 per cent in June from (-) 85.3 per cent in May, indicative of tentative urban demand, and faster recovery of sales in rural areas. On the other hand, domestic air passenger traffic and cargo traffic continued to post sharp contraction. Construction activity remained tepid _ cement production fell and finished steel consumption moderated sharply in June. Imports of capital goods _ a key indicator of investment activity _ declined further in June. The services PMI continued in contractionary zone in July to 34.2, although the downturn eased relative to the May and June readings.The National Statistical Office (NSO) released data on headline CPI for the month of June 2020 on July 13, 2020, along with imputed back prints of the index for April and May 2020. This resulted in a sharp upward revision of food inflation for the month of April and May. During Q1:2020-21 food inflation moderated from 10.5 per cent in April to 7.3 per cent in June 2020. Meanwhile, fuel inflation edged up as international kerosene and LPG prices firmed up. Inflation excluding food and fuel was at 5.4 per cent in June, reflecting a spike in prices across most sub-groups. Inflation in transport and communication, personal care and effects, pan-tobacco and education registered significant increases in June. Headline CPI inflation, which was at 5.8 per cent in March 2020 was placed at 6.1 per cent in the provisional estimates for June 2020.For the second successive round, households¡¯ three months ahead expectations remained above their one year ahead expectations, indicating their anticipation of lower inflation over the longer horizon. Producers¡¯ sentiments on input prices remained muted as their salary outgoes fell. Their selling prices contracted in Q1 in the April-June round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s industrial outlook survey. The contraction in output prices is also corroborated by firms participating in the manufacturing PMI survey. Domestic financial conditions have eased substantially and systemic liquidity remains in large surplus, due to the conventional and unconventional measures by the Reserve Bank since February 2020. Cumulatively, these measures assured liquidity of the order of _9.57 lakh crore or 4.7 per cent of GDP. Reflecting these developments, reserve money (RM) increased by 15.4 per cent on a year-on-year basis (as on July 31, 2020), driven by a surge in currency demand (23.1 per cent). Growth in money supply (M3), however, was contained at 12.4 per cent as on July 17, 2020. Average daily net absorptions under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) moderated from _5.3 lakh crore in May 2020 to _4.1 lakh crore in June as government spending slowed. In July, average daily net absorptions under the LAF moderated further to _4.0 lakh crore, as government spending remained subdued. During 2020-21 (up to July 31), _1,24,154 crore was injected through open market operation (OMO) purchases. In order to distribute liquidity more evenly across the term structure and improve transmission, the Reserve Bank conducted ¡®operation twist¡¯ auctions involving the simultaneous sale and purchase of government securities for _10,000 crore on July 2, 2020. Furthermore, the utilisation of refinance provided by the Reserve Bank to the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) and the National Housing Bank (NHB) increased to _34,566 crore on July 31, 2020 from _22,334 crore during the May policy.The transmission to bank lending rates has improved further, with the weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans declining by 91 bps during March-June 2020. The spreads of 3-year AAA rated corporate bonds over G-Secs of similar maturity declined from 276 bps on March 26, 2020 to 50 bps by end-July 2020. Even for the lowest investment grade bonds (BBB-), spreads have come down by 125 bps by end-July 2020. Lower borrowing costs have led to record primary issuance of corporate bonds of _2.1 lakh crore in the first quarter of 2020-21.India¡¯s merchandise exports contracted for the fourth successive month in June 2020, although the pace of fall moderated on improving shipments of agriculture and pharmaceutical products. Imports fell sharply in June in a broad-based manner, reflecting weak domestic demand and low international crude oil prices. The merchandise trade balance recorded a surplus in June (US$ 0.8 billion), after a gap of over 18 years. The current account balance turned into a marginal surplus of 0.1 per cent of GDP in Q4 of 2019-20 as against a deficit of 0.7 per cent a year ago. On the financing side, net foreign direct investment moderated to US$ 4.4 billion in April-May 2020 from US$ 7.2 billion a year ago. In 2020-21 (till July 31), net foreign portfolio investment (FPI) in equities at US$ 5.3 billion was higher than US$ 1.2 billion a year ago. In the debt segment, however, there were outflows of US$ 4.4 billion during the same period as against inflows of US$ 2.0 billion a year ago. Net investment under the voluntary retention route increased by US$ 0.9 billion during the same period. India¡¯s foreign exchange reserves have increased by US$ 56.8 billion in 2020-21 so far (up to July 31) to US$ 534.6 billion _ equivalent to 13.4 months of imports."
other,"In our assessment, the current level of the S$NEER is conducive to supporting the incipient recovery in the Singapore economy, and to maintaining domestic price stability in a low-inflation environment.  The MAS will therefore re-centre the exchange rate policy band at the current level of the S$NEER, while maintaining a zero percent appreciation path.  The width of the band will remain unchanged.  This monetary policy stance will help support economic growth, particularly in view of the downside risks in the external environment.  CPI inflation is expected to stay below 2% into 2004.MAS will be shifting the schedule of its semi-annual monetary policy cycle from January/July to April/October.  The current monetary policy cycle of January/July was first formalised in 2001.  A review of the experience in the past two years suggested that shifting the policy cycle to April and October would facilitate the incorporation of the fiscal impact of the annual Budget on the economy in the April review of monetary policy.  It would also allow MAS to make better use of the forecast and data releases by the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) and Department of Statistics (DOS) in assessing the economic outlook and the appropriate monetary policy stance.  The next Monetary Policy Statement will be released in October 2003, together with the Macroeconomic Review (Vol II, Issue 2)."
other,"On the domestic front, the growth of real gross value added (GVA) in Q2 of 2016-17 turned out to be lower than projected on account of a deeper than expected slowdown in industrial activity. Manufacturing slowed down both sequentially and on an annual basis, with weak demand conditions and the firming up of input costs dragging down the profitability of corporations. Gross fixed capital formation contracted for the third consecutive quarter. Although government final consumption expenditure slowed sequentially, it supported private final consumption expenditure, the mainstay of aggregate demand. The contribution of net exports to aggregate demand remained positive, but on account of a sharper contraction in imports relative to exports.Turning to Q3, the Committee felt that the assessment is clouded by the still unfolding effects of the withdrawal of specified bank notes (SBNs). The steady expansion in acreage under rabi sowing across major crops compared to a year ago should build on the robust performance of agriculture in Q2. By contrast, industrial activity remains weak. Among the core industries in the index of industrial production (IIP), the output of coal contracted in October due to subdued demand, while the production of crude oil and natural gas shrank under the binding constraint of structural impediments. The production of cement, fertilisers and electricity continued to decelerate, reflecting the sluggishness in underlying economic activity. On the other hand, steel output has recorded sustained expansion following the application of countervailing duties. Refinery output accelerated on the back of a pick-up in exports and capacity additions. The withdrawal of SBNs could transiently interrupt some part of industrial activity in November-December due to delays in payments of wages and purchases of inputs, although a fuller assessment is awaited.

earthquake,"An earthquake of 4.1 magnitude hit north Bengal on Tuesday morning, data from the National Center for Seismology showed.
The earthquake, the second to hit the region in less than 12 hours, occurred around 7 am, with the epicenter 64 km east of Siliguri. The depth was 10 km.
No damage or losses has been reported so far, officials said.
Tremors were felt across the north Bengal districts of Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar and Darjeeling. The impact was also felt in parts of Sikkim.
On Monday night, an earthquake of 5.4 magnitude hit Sikkim with tremors being also felt in the states of Assam, West Bengal and Bihar.
The quake occurred at 8.49 pm at a depth of 10 km near the India-Bhutan border."
Typhoon,"The second powerful typhoon to slam Japan in a week unleashed fierce winds and rain on southern islands on Sunday, blowing off rooftops and leaving homes without power as it edged northward into an area vulnerable to flooding and mudslides
Weather officials warned that the rainfall from what could be a record storm would be fierce. Warnings were issued days in advance for people to be ready to take shelter and stock up on food and water.
Several rivers on the main southwestern island of Kyushu were at risk of overflowing, officials said. Public broadcaster NHK TV said evacuation warnings were issued for more than 50,000 people in Okinawa and Kyushu, including Kagoshima and and Nagasaki prefectures.
News footage showed people in Kyushu starting to gather at gymnasiums, before winds gather momentum in the evening. Social distancing will be in place to guard against the coronavirus pandemic, officials said.
The Japan Meteorological Agency said Typhoon Haishen, which means “sea god” in Chinese, was packing sustained winds of up to 162 kilometers (100 miles) per hour after battering Okinawa and the southern Kyushu island of Amami Oshima early Sunday. Alerts for strong winds, waves, high tides, rainfall and lightning were issued for Amami Oshima alongside evacuation orders.
There were no immediate reports of any injuries in Okinawa, home to more than half of the roughly 50,000 U.S. troops based in Japan under a bilateral treaty.
Haishen was not only powerful — equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane — but also large in its reach, according to the meteorological agency.
Bullet trains were temporarily halting services, and dozens of flights were canceled. All Nippon Airways said such cancellations will continue Monday and possibly on Tuesday for flights in southern Japan, such as Yamaguchi, Kochi and Fukuoka.
Haishen’s projected course has it hitting the Korean Peninsula later in the week.
Haishen’s course is similar to Typhoon Maysak, which lashed southern Japan last week, injuring dozens of people and cutting power to thousands of homes.
A cargo ship carrying 43 crew members and 5,800 cows from New Zealand capsized off the coast of Japan. Two people were rescued, and one body was recovered. The search has been halted because of Haishen."
other,"Regulation, surveillance and enforcement are three important facets of financial sector oversight mechanism. Regulations determine the framework in which financial entities function so that prudence, transparency, and comparability are ensured on the one hand and customer interests are protected on the other. Surveillance is the process through which adherence to the regulations is monitored. Enforcement deals with cases of non-compliance with regulations noticed either through the surveillance process or otherwise. Currently, in the Reserve Bank, there is a clear demarcation of the regulatory and surveillance functions. With a view to developing a sound framework and process for enforcement action, it has been decided to establish a separate Enforcement Department. Necessary steps have been initiated in this regard and the new department will start functioning from April 1, 2017.Based on the recommendations of the Expert Panel on Information Technology Examination and Cyber Security (Chairperson: Smt. Meena Hemachandra), the Reserve Bank has issued guidelines to banks on June 2, 2016 mandating cyber security preparedness for addressing cyber risks. While banks have taken steps to strengthen their defences, the diverse and ingenious nature of recent cyber-attacks necessitates an ongoing review of the cyber security landscape and emerging threats. Towards this end, an inter-disciplinary Standing Committee on Cyber Security is being constituted to, inter alia,"
flood,"55 dead, 7 missing in central Vietnam's natural disasters HANOI, Oct. 16 (Xinhua) -- Floods and other natural disasters triggered by heavy downpours have killed 55 people and left seven others missing in central Vietnam over the past 10 days, the country's Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control said on Friday.  The death toll increased from 40 on Thursday. The victims were mainly reported in the provinces of Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue and Quang Nam, according to the committee's latest report.  Among the dead, 13 were part of a rescue team who suffered a landslide on their way to verify reports of victims buried by a previous landslide in Thua Thien Hue's Phong Dien district. Over 30 others were swept away by floods, the committee said, adding that search and rescue is underway for the remaining missing.  Between Oct. 5 to 13, heavy downpours were witnessed in central and central highlands Vietnam, with the accumulative rainfall surpassing 2,000 mm in some areas.  Some 900 hectares of rice fields and over 5,500 hectares of other croplands were submerged. Meanwhile, more than 445,700 cattle and poultry animals were killed or swept away, said the committee.  Heavy rains are expected to hit Vietnam's central and central highlands localities again starting from Friday and may last until Oct. 21, according to the country's National Centre for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.  As of Sept. 22, natural disasters had left 93 people dead or missing and 272 injured in Vietnam."
wildfires,"A fire raged out of control on the Spanish holiday island of Gran Canaria, forcing evacuations as flames rose so high even water-dropping planes could not operate in what was dubbed an ""environmental tragedy"".
The blaze, the third in 10 days in the mountainous centre of the island, has forced the evacuation of several villages with a combined population of 9,000, a spokeswoman for the emergency services said.
The exact number of evacuees was unclear on the island that lies at the heart of the Canary archipelago off the coast of northwest Africa.
No fatalities have been reported and tourism on Gran Canaria, which boasts breathtaking views and is popular with foreigners, had not been affected.
""It's a huge forest fire, extremely serious, which happened in a heatwave,"" and it is still not under control, Canary Islands President Angel Victor Torres told reporters late Monday.
""This is an environmental tragedy.""
Altogether, 1,000 firefighters and other crew and 14 water-dropping helicopters and planes were working on controlling the blaze, which is estimated to have destroyed 10,000 hectares (24,700 acres), according to emergency services.
This deployment ""is the biggest ever carried out in the Canaries and one of the biggest implemented in Spain in the past few years,"" said Agriculture Minister Luis Planas.
Firefighters said the blaze was propelled by high temperatures, strong winds and low humidity.
So fierce is the fire in what is part of a UNESCO biosphere reserve that in some areas, it ""is beyond our extinction capacities,"" Federico Grillo, head of emergency services in Gran Canaria, said late Sunday.
On the northwestern flank of the blaze, flames have risen as high as 50 metres (160 feet), preventing ground crew or water-dropping aircraft from approaching, the emergency services spokeswoman said.
She added around 100 people had been ""confined"" to the cultural centre of Artenara, unable to leave this village in the disaster zone as all possible evacuation roads were too dangerous.
Environment Minister Planas said the next 48 hours would be ""critical"".
The fire broke out on Saturday afternoon, just days after another wildfire in the same region forced the evacuation of hundreds.
Lourdes Hernandez, an expert on wildfires at WWF, told AFP the blaze had entered the Tamadaba natural park, an untouched pine forest that represents ""the main green lungs of the island"".
The fire is also threatening the Inagua nature reserve, another area of major biodiversity."
wildfires,"Australia's wildfires have destroyed more than a fifth of the country's forests, making the blazes ""globally unprecedented"" following a years-long drought linked to climate change, researchers said Monday.
Climate scientists are currently examining data from the disaster, which destroyed swathes of southeastern Australia, to determine to what extent they can be attributed to rising temperatures.
In a special edition of the journal Nature Climate Change, Australian researchers examined several other aspects of the blazes, including investigations into their extent and possible causes.
One study showed that between September 2019 and January 2020 around 5.8 million hectares of broadleaf forest were burned in New South Wales and Victoria.
This accounts for roughly 21 percent of the nation's forested area, making this fire season proportionately the most devastating on record.
""Halfway through Spring 2019 we realised that a very large part of the eastern Australian forest could be burned in this single season,"" Matthias Boer, from the Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment at Western Sydney University, Penrith, told AFP.
""The shock came from realising that this season was off the charts globally in terms of the percentage of the continental section of a forest biome that burned.""
Boer said his study almost certainly underestimates the extent of forest loss as the island state of Tasmania was not covered in the data.
Australia's annual average forest loss to wild fires is typically well below 2 percent."
other,"Although monetary policy is working to promote a more robust recovery, it cannot carry the entire burden of ensuring a speedier return to economic health. The economy's performance both over the near term and in the longer run will depend importantly on the course of fiscal policy. The challenge for the Congress and the Administration is to put the federal budget on a sustainable long-run path that promotes economic growth and stability without unnecessarily impeding the current recovery.Significant progress has been made recently toward reducing the federal budget deficit over the next few years. The projections released earlier this month by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) indicate that, under current law, the federal deficit will narrow from 7 percent of GDP last year to 2-1/2 percent in fiscal year 2015.8 As a result, the federal debt held by the public (including that held by the Federal Reserve) is projected to remain roughly 75 percent of GDP through much of the current decade.However, a substantial portion of the recent progress in lowering the deficit has been concentrated in near-term budget changes, which, taken together, could create a significant headwind for the economic recovery. The CBO estimates that deficit-reduction policies in current law will slow the pace of real GDP growth by about 1-1/2 percentage points this year, relative to what it would have been otherwise. A significant portion of this effect is related to the automatic spending sequestration that is scheduled to begin on March 1, which, according to the CBO's estimates, will contribute about 0.6 percentage point to the fiscal drag on economic growth this year. Given the still-moderate underlying pace of economic growth, this additional near-term burden on the recovery is significant. Moreover, besides having adverse effects on jobs and incomes, a slower recovery would lead to less actual deficit reduction in the short run for any given set of fiscal actions.At the same time, and despite progress in reducing near-term budget deficits, the difficult process of addressing longer-term fiscal imbalances has only begun. Indeed, the CBO projects that the federal deficit and debt as a percentage of GDP will begin rising again in the latter part of this decade, reflecting in large part the aging of the population and fast-rising health-care costs. To promote economic growth in the longer term, and to preserve economic and financial stability, fiscal policymakers will have to put the federal budget on a sustainable long-run path that first stabilizes the ratio of federal debt to GDP and, given the current elevated level of debt, eventually places that ratio on a downward trajectory. Between 1960 and the onset of the financial crisis, federal debt averaged less than 40 percent of GDP. This relatively low level of debt provided the nation much-needed flexibility to meet the economic challenges of the past few years. Replenishing this fiscal capacity will give future Congresses and Administrations greater scope to deal with unforeseen events."
earthquake,"Earthquake in Turkey-Iran border region kills nine, injures more than 100 ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Nine people were killed and buildings collapsed across southeastern Turkey on Sunday when a magnitude 5.7 earthquake struck near the border with Iran, injuring more than a hundred in villages and towns in both countries, government officials said. In Turkey, three of the dead were children, and 50 people were injured, including nine critically, the health ministry said. The shallow tremor caused more than 1,000 buildings to collapse in Turkey, prompting a brief rescue effort to find those trapped under rubble. The quake damaged buildings some 90 km (56 miles) to the west in the Turkish city of Van, and to the east in dozens of villages in Iran, where state TV said 75 people were injured including six in hospital. There were several aftershocks including a larger tremor measuring 6.0 magnitude that stuck nearby 10 hours later. There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties from that quake, which was also fairly shallow and potentially dangerous. Crisscrossed by major fault lines, Iran and Turkey are among the most earthquake-prone countries in the world."
other,"Labor market conditions continued to improve during the second half of 2015 and into early 2016. Payroll employment has increased at a solid average pace of 225,000 per month since June. The unemployment rate, which had reached a high of 10 percent in late 2009, declined from 5.3 percent last June to 4.9 percent in January. Although the unemployment rate now equals the median of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants' estimates of its longer-run normal level, other considerations suggest that some further improvement in labor market conditions is needed to achieve the Committee's maximum employment mandate. The labor force participation rate remains somewhat below most assessments of its trend, and an unusually large number of people continue to work part time when they would prefer full-time employment."
flood,"Minor flooding expected on Missouri River in Washington Heavy rain across the central and northern part of Missouri is expected to push the Missouri River in Downtown Washington over flood stage over the weekend, according to the National Weather Service.  The river, measured at 6.76 feet Friday at 9:45 a.m., is expected to rapidly rise. It’s expected to reach the 20-foot flood stage Saturday at 7 p.m.  The rate of rise is expected to slow until the river crests in minor flood stage at 25.5 feet Monday at 1 p.m.  From there, the river level is expected to drop slowly.  The projection is based upon past precipitation in the drainage area and precipitation expected in the next 24 hours.  At 25.5 feet, the lower parking lot in Rennick Riverfront Park will be flooded and both segments of the Rotary Riverfront Trail will be under water in different places."
other,"With progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic have shown improvement but have not fully recovered. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation having run persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer_term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved. The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. Last December, the Committee indicated that it would continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage_backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward its maximum employment and price stability goals. Since then, the economy has made progress toward these goals, and the Committee will continue to assess progress in coming meetings. These asset purchases help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments."

At least 55 people were killed after flash floods and landslides struck Indonesia on Sunday, rescue officials said. At least 21 people have also died from the floods in the tiny half-island nation of East Timor.  Worst hit was East Flores regency in Indonesia's southernmost East Nusa Tenggara province.  Authorities expect the death toll to rise."
drought,"A national report shows Florida’s drought has escalated in key areas northwest of Lake Okeechobee to the “extreme” level.
About 6 percent of the state is now in an extreme drought – a level that could mean major crop, pasture losses, widespread water shortages and water restrictions.
This is the first report this  year to show extreme areas of drought in Florida.
Nationwide, only Florida and a small area of North Georgia are in extreme drought.
The drought  north of Lake Okeechobee means less water going into the lake and less water being discharged into the Caloosahatchee estuary.
During rainy years, this is a good thing, but the drier weather is hurting the Caloosahatchee this year and some people are asking for the discharges to be increased.
“The extremes hit us in both directions,” said Mark Generales, a member of the South Florida Water Management District’s Water Resources Advisory Commission, or WRAC. “You are giving us 300 cubic feet per second and we really need 650.”"
other,"In the labor market, the number of nonfarm payroll jobs rose 2.7 million in 2015, and posted a further gain of 150,000 in January of this year. The cumulative increase in employment since its trough in early 2010, is now more than 13 million jobs. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate fell to 4.9 percent in January, 0.8 percentage point below its level a year ago and in line with the median of FOMC participants' most recent estimates of its longer-run normal level. Other measures of labor market conditions have also shown solid improvement, with noticeable declines over the past year in the number of individuals who want and are available to work but have not actively searched recently, and in the number of people who are working part time but would rather work full time. However, these measures remain above the levels seen prior to the recession, suggesting that some slack in labor markets remains. Thus, while labor market conditions have improved substantially, there is still room for further sustainable improvement.The strong gains in the job market last year were accompanied by a continued moderate expansion in economic activity. U.S. real gross domestic product is estimated to have increased about 1-3/4 percent in 2015. Over the course of the year, subdued foreign growth and the appreciation of the dollar restrained net exports. In the fourth quarter of last year, growth in the gross domestic product is reported to have slowed more sharply, to an annual rate of just 3/4 percent; again, growth was held back by weak net exports as well as by a negative contribution from inventory investment. Although private domestic final demand appears to have slowed somewhat in the fourth quarter, it has continued to advance. Household spending has been supported by steady job gains and solid growth in real disposable income--aided in part by the declines in oil prices. One area of particular strength has been purchases of cars and light trucks; sales of these vehicles in 2015, reached their highest level ever. In the drilling and mining sector, lower oil prices have caused companies to slash jobs and sharply cut capital outlays, but in most other sectors, business investment rose over the second half of last year. And homebuilding activity has continued to move up, on balance, although the level of new construction remains well below the longer-run levels implied by demographic trends.Financial conditions in the United States have recently become less supportive of growth, with declines in broad measures of equity prices, higher borrowing rates for riskier borrowers, and a further appreciation of the dollar. These developments, if they prove persistent, could weigh on the outlook for economic activity and the labor market, although declines in longer-term interest rates and oil prices provide some offset. Still, ongoing employment gains and faster wage growth should support the growth of real incomes and therefore consumer spending, and global economic growth should pick up over time, supported by highly accommodative monetary policies abroad. Against this backdrop, the Committee expects that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in coming years and that labor market indicators will continue to strengthen.As is always the case, the economic outlook is uncertain. Foreign economic developments, in particular, pose risks to U.S. economic growth. Most notably, although recent economic indicators do not suggest a sharp slowdown in Chinese growth, declines in the foreign exchange value of the renminbi have intensified uncertainty about China's exchange rate policy and the prospects for its economy. This uncertainty led to increased volatility in global financial markets and, against the background of persistent weakness abroad, exacerbated concerns about the outlook for global growth. These growth concerns, along with strong supply conditions and high inventories, contributed to the recent fall in the prices of oil and other commodities. In turn, low commodity prices could trigger financial stresses in commodity-exporting economies, particularly in vulnerable emerging market economies, and for commodity-producing firms in many countries. Should any of these downside risks materialize, foreign activity and demand for U.S. exports could weaken and financial market conditions could tighten further.Of course, economic growth could also exceed our projections for a number of reasons, including the possibility that low oil prices will boost U.S. economic growth more than we expect. At present, the Committee is closely monitoring global economic and financial developments, as well as assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation and the balance of risks to the outlook."

The exact magnitude, epicenter, and depth of the quake might be revised within the next few hours or minutes as seismologists review data and refine their calculations, or as other agencies issue their report. A second report was later issued by the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC), which listed it as a magnitude 6.6 earthquake. Based on the preliminary seismic data, the quake should have been felt by everybody in the area of the epicenter. In those areas, dangerous ground shaking occurred with the potential to inflict moderate to heavy damage to buildings and other infrastructure. Towns or cities where the quake likely caused strong ground shaking include Moderate shaking probably occurred in San Juan (pop. 447,000) located 39 km from the epicenter, Santa Lucia (pop. 43,600) 40 km away, Villa Paula de Sarmiento (pop. 19,100) 43 km away, Chimbas (pop. 73,800) 44 km away, Caucete (pop. 33,600) 45 km away, and Albardon (pop. 20,400) 50 km away.

other,"The Reserve Bank has, over time, issued regulations covering various interest rate derivative products such as Interest Rate Swap (IRS), Forward Rate Agreement (FRA), Interest Rate Future (IRF), Interest Rate Option (IRO) and Money Market Future (MMF). The comprehensive guidelines on derivatives was issued in 2007 to clearly define the roles and responsibilities for users and market makers. However, except Overnight Indexed Swaps (OIS), the activity in these derivative markets has been rather thin and limited. This, among other reasons, has contributed to a limited use of interest rate derivatives in the Indian financial sector. Some of these regulations have also not been reviewed for almost two decades (IRS/FRA guideline of 1999). It is, therefore, proposed to rationalise interest rate derivative regulations to achieve consistency and ease of access with the eventual objective of fostering a thriving environment for management of interest rate risk in the Indian economy. The draft comprehensive guidelines will be issued for public feedback by the end of March 2019.It was proposed in the Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies, in the Fourth Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement dated October 05, 2018, to introduce a regulatory framework for financial benchmarks to improve the governance of the benchmark processes relating to financial products and markets regulated by the Reserve Bank. Draft guidelines are being issued for public consultation.As a part of the review of the FPI investment in Corporate Debt undertaken in April 2018, it was stipulated that no FPI shall have an exposure of more than 20% of its corporate bond portfolio to a single corporate (including exposure to entities related to the corporate). FPIs were given exemption from this requirement on their new investments till end-March 2019 to adjust their portfolios. While the provision was aimed at incentivizing FPIs to maintain a portfolio of assets, further market feedback indicates that FPIs have been constrained by this stipulation. In order to encourage a wider spectrum of investors to access the Indian corporate debt market, it is now proposed to withdraw this provision. A circular to this effect will be issued by mid-February, 2019."

If all goes to plan, the ship will make its first journey between two Norwegian towns before the end of the year, with no crew onboard. Instead, its movements will be monitored from three onshore data control centers.
It's not the first autonomous ship -- an autonomous ferry launched in Finland in 2018 -- but it is the first fully electric container ship, say its makers. Developed by chemical company Yara International, the Yara Birkeland was designed to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides, which are toxic pollutants and greenhouse gases, and carbon dioxide, as well as moving freight away from roads to the sea.
The shipping industry currently accounts for between 2.5% and 3% of global greenhouse gases emissions, according to the International Maritime Organization.
Nearly all of Norway's electricity is generated by hydroelectric power, which is generally considered to have much lower carbon emissions than burning fossil fuels, although it still produces greenhouse gases.
First conceptualized in 2017, the ship was created in partnership with technology firm Kongsberg Maritime and shipbuilder Vard. Capable of carrying 103 containers and with a top speed of 13 knots, it will use a 7 MWh battery, with ""about a thousand times the capacity of one electrical car,"" according to Jon Sletten, plant manager for Yara's factory in Porsgrunn, Norway.
He says it will be charged at the quayside ""before sailing to container harbors along the coast and then back again, replacing 40,000 truck journeys a year."""
other,"The global economy is stabilising after contracting sharply in the December and March quarters. Over recent months, the value of international trade and global industrial production have both recorded modest gains after earlier large declines, and the extreme risk aversion seen earlier in the year has receded somewhat. Reflecting this, forecasts for world growth are being revised up for the first time in more than a year.The pick-up in economic conditions is most evident in China, where growth has been boosted by a large fiscal stimulus and increased bank lending. Elsewhere in Asia, output has retraced part of the earlier sharp falls, with a number of countries benefiting from the stronger growth in China, their own fiscal and monetary stimulus, and the absence of significant problems in their financial systems. There are fewer signs of recovery in the advanced economies, although the rate at which output is contracting has slowed noticeably. In the United States, in particular, there is tentative evidence that the economy is reaching a turning point, with the housing market showing signs of stabilisation."

Jojo Siwa will be dancing with a female pro, it was announced at a news conference Thursday during the Television Critics Association press tour. This is the first time two women will be paired together in the show's 30 seasons.
Siwa said she's proud that her choice to dance with a female ""breaks a wall that has never been broken down before"" and tells younger people you can ""dance with who you want to dance with.""
Siwa, a singer and social media star, opened up about her sexuality in January, saying she was a member of the LGBTQ+ community and in a relationship.
Gymnast Suni Lee, a three-time Olympics medalist, joins the show after taking home the gold in the all-around competition at the recent Tokyo Games.
Additional cast members -- and Siwa and Lee's partners -- will be unveiled on September 8."
flood,"The start of 2021 in Morocco was marked by heavy rainfall that caused disruptions and significant infrastructural damage, particularly to Casablanca. The deluge also brought much-needed water to the country's dams and reservoirs, after two years of drought.
On January 6, 2021, several roads in various cities in the country were shut after heavy rains triggered flooding, paralyzing normal life across the country.
At Boulevard Zerktouni, one of the main arteries of the capital, the sidewalk was entirely inundated while many cars floated.
The same situation was reported in other boulevards, such as Roudani and Moulay Ismail. Firefighters had to intervene and rescue stranded people in vehicles.
""There are traffic jams all over the city because of the floods. I came from the highway and I thought that at Zerktouni it would circulate better, but the tunnel is closed so it’s the same thing. I’ve been in my car for five hours,"" said one motorist.
Significant damage to infrastructure and property was reported in Casablanca, one of the worst affected cities. Public transport was halted, and some neighborhoods were also flooded."
drought,"The ongoing spell of drought and severe water shortages are affecting more than 300 million people in the country, the Indian government said recently, turning the spotlight on a problem that has frequently plagued the South Asian nation in recent years.
There are various ways in which a drought can be defined. A meteorological drought is when there is a shortfall of rains. A hydrological drought occurs when deficient rainfall leads to plummeting water reserves. And agricultural drought is declared when the lack of water affects crops and harvests.
India relies heavily on seasonal monsoon rains for rainfall and water. And as a result of poor monsoons over the past two years as well as weak rainfall in the early months of this year, reservoirs, ponds and wells have dried up in many parts of the vast nation, causing acute water shortages.
The situation has forced authorities in some Indian states to ration drinking water and use trains to transport fresh water to certain drought-ravaged areas."
other,"After several months of steady economic recovery and market ascent, we suddenly find ourselves in yet another alarming moment of economic uncertainty and potential peril. Thanks to a historic rise in inflation, the Federal Reserve just moved up its timeline for rate hikes. Stock prices quickly took a downward turn, signaling the possibility of a new era of market volatility. At the same time, some in Washington seek to reimpose on the United States the industrialized world¡¯s highest corporate taxes and even begin taxing all financial transactions. Amid all of this, the ability to anticipate market developments and pivot quickly becomes even more important, particularly for institutional investors like pensions which require reliable returns for their members.Unfortunately, too many activists and political leaders, fueled by the GameStop and other so-called meme stock volatility episodes, remain stubbornly obsessed with demonizing and restricting one of the most important tools for navigating a volatile market: short sales. A corrective to the anti-short sales campaign is therefore needed. "
wildfires,"The Nagaland authority on Saturday expressed hope that the raging week-long wildfire in the famed Dzukou Valley on its border with Manipur will be brought under control within two days, with the Indian Air Force (IAF) helicopters, over 300 volunteers and personnel of many departments continuing their efforts to extinguish the inferno at the biodiversity hotspot.
Nagaland State Disaster Management Authority's Officer on Special Duty, Johnny Ruangmei said that the heavy gusty winds have affected the officials' effort to tame the fire but we expect that it would be fully brought under control by Monday, as the blaze has been contained partially.
""The IAF helicopters on Saturday sprayed 8 tonnes of water on the wildfire. Over 300 volunteers accompanied by the personnel of various departments and organisations were battling against the raging fire,"" Ruangmei told IANS over phone.
He said that the army, state police, state and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), Forest Department, volunteers of Southern Angami Youth Organisation (SAYO), accompanied by the local people and NGOs, are jointly making fire lines in the Valley to break off the link between the blaze and the forest.
The disaster management officials said that as the fire continued in multiple pockets and hillocks, they are yet to assess the damage and natural destruction of the valley.
IAF spokesperson Wing Commander Ratnakar Singh said that following a requisition by Nagaland, the Eastern Air Command in Shillong had initially deployed a Mi-17V5 helicopter to check the wildfire.
""After assessment of the extent of fire, the IAF is deploying three more helicopters equipped with Bambi Bucket. C-130J Hercules aircraft of the IAF airlifted 9 tonnes load for fighting the fire including 48 NDRF personnel from Guwahati to Dimapur on Friday night,"" Wing Commander Singh told IANS over phone from Shillong.
Manipur Chief Minister N. Biren Singh, who had conducted an aerial survey to take stock of the wildfire that has caused huge damage since it broke out on Tuesday, on Saturday tweeted that the NDRF HQ has now deployed 60 personnel at the wildfire site at the Dzukou Valley. Also two helicopters equipped with Bambi bucket have been deployed to fight the wildfire."

Furthermore, the initial stages of the recovery in the US and global economy will in all likelihood be modest and hesitant. We therefore expect the Singapore economy to remain subdued in the near term, and to start picking up only in the second half of 2002. Inflationary pressures are likely to be absent this year.In our assessment, the current level of the S$NEER is supportive of economic recovery and growth in a benign inflationary environment. The MAS will therefore maintain a zero percent appreciation path for the policy band, centred on the current level of the S$NEER. We are also restoring a narrower policy band, as market and economic conditions have become less volatile."
Typhoon,"Super Typhoon Haiyan, also called_yphoon Haiyan_r_yphoon Yolanda, massive and highly destructive_torm_n the North_acific Ocean_hat affected_alau, the_hilippines,_ietnam, and_hina_uring early November 2013. The_ropical cyclone_roduced high_inds, coastal storm surges, heavy rains, and_looding_n the land areas over which it passed. By far the worst-hit region was the central Philippines, where the storm produced widespread devastation and killed thousands of people. Many considered it to be the country’s worst natural disaster. With maximum sustained winds at landfall there that measured 195 miles (314 km) per hour, Haiyan was among the most powerful tropical cyclones ever recorded, if not the most powerful, to strike land.
The typhoon began as an area of_onvection_ocated in the equatorial Pacific Ocean some 230 nautical miles (425 km) east-southeast of_ohnpei_n November 2. Later that day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) at_earl Harbor,_awaii, reclassified the disturbance as a tropical depression, naming the storm Tropical Depression 31W. The system traveled westward across the tropical Pacific Ocean over the next few days, growing in size and strength. The Japan Meteorological Agency reclassified the phenomenon as a_ropical storm_t midnight_reenwich Mean Time(GMT) on November 4 and assigned the name Haiyan, after its winds had reached a measured speed of 40 miles (64 km) per hour. With winds increasing to 75 miles (120 km) per hour sometime during the early afternoon on November 5, Haiyan had become a typhoon.
The storm continued to increase in intensity, and the JTWC upgraded Haiyan to a super typhoon (equivalent to a strong category 4 or category 5 hurricane, with maximum sustained one-minute surface winds of at least 150 miles [241 km] per hour) at 2:45_M_MT (10:45_M_ocal time) on November 6. At that moment Haiyan was located some 113 nautical miles (209 km) east-northeast of Palau and was moving westward at about 21 miles (about 34 km) per hour. Later in the day, the storm swelled to more than 500 miles (about 800 km) in diameter with a 9-mile- (14.5-km-) wide eye. Early in the morning of November 7, the storm’s eye wall passed over Palau’s Kayangel Islands with winds that, according to some reports, approached 155 miles (250 km) per hour. Haiyan’s winds continued to increase through the day, rising to 195 miles (314 km) per hour with gusts measured at 235 miles (378 km) per hour.
Haiyan made landfall in the Philippines at the city of Guiuan on the island of_amar_t 4:40_M_ocal time on November 8. The storm’s_tmospheric pressure_t that point was measured at 895 millibars (its lowest reading), and Haiyan had maximum sustained winds of 195 miles (314 km) per hour, the highest wind speed ever recorded at landfall. By 8:00_M_ocal time, Haiyan had reached the city of_acloban_n the island of_eyte, with winds in excess of 185 miles (298 km) per hour."
other,"Global economic growth slowed a little in recent months after picking up in early 2012. Concerns about the fiscal and banking problems facing the euro area continue to weigh on the global economic outlook and have led to considerable volatility in financial markets. The flow of data over recent months suggests that economic activity contracted further in Europe. The US economy is expected to continue to experience only modest growth. Below-trend growth in Europe and the United States appears to be dampening growth in much of Asia, although in China there are signs that economic growth may have stabilised at a more sustainable pace of 7_8 per cent. Policymakers in a number of jurisdictions have responded to concerns about the outlook for economic growth and a moderation in inflation by easing monetary conditions further over recent months.These developments, and the flow of data since the May Statement, have led to small downward revisions to forecasts of growth for most economies around the world, so that expectations are for global growth to be close to average in 2012, at around 3_ per cent, before picking up to about 4 per cent in 2013. The increasing importance of the fastergrowing emerging market economies, particularly in Asia, is helping to drive global growth, while in the advanced economies, fiscal consolidation and the ongoing effects of deleveraging by the private sector are likely to be a drag on growth for some time."

The magnitude 6.8 quake shook Elazig province, about 550 km (340 miles) east of the capital Ankara, and was followed by more than 270 aftershocks, 12 of which had magnitudes over 4.
Eighteen people were killed in Elazig and four more in the neighbouring province of Malatya, said Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Authority (AFAD), adding 1,031 others were injured and in hospitals in the region. It said rescue efforts were underway at three different sites in Elazig.

earthquake,"A powerful earthquake struck off the coast of northeastern Japan at 05:46:23 UTC (14:46:23 local time) on March 11, causing severe shaking near the epicenter region and triggering a massive tsunami that devastated coastal communities. Estimates issued by AIR Worldwide, EQECAT and Risk Management Solutions (RMS) suggest insured losses could be between USD12 billion and USD34 billion. There are fears the death toll could now exceed 27,000 people and powerful aftershocks continue to shake the region. Tens of thousands of buildings were destroyed or damaged across northern Japan despite the country boasting the strictest building standards in the world. Officials say the situation at the quake-damaged nuclear facility in Fukushima has improved over the last couple of weeks, but remains serious. According to both the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA), the earthquake’s magnitude was measured at 9.0, making it the fourth most powerful earthquake in the world since 1900 and the largest in Japan since modern instrumental recordings began 130 years ago. The USGS added that the earthquake was located 130 kilometers (80 miles) east of Sendai and 373 kilometers (230 miles) northeast of Tokyo, at a depth of 32 kilometers (19.9 miles).
More than 1,000 aftershocks have hit the region since the main earthquake, the most powerful at 7.9Mw. Two powerful aftershocks have hit the region recently. A 7.1Mw earthquake killed at least three people and caused blackouts in many areas when it struck around 65 kilometers (40 miles) east of Sendai on April 7. Several buildings were reportedly destroyed and power was cut to around 3.6 million households. The second big aftershock occurred this morning (April 11). The epicenter of this 6.6Mw earthquake occurred inland, around 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of Tokyo. Authorities issued a tsunami alert immediately after the earthquake, but it was subsequently cancelled. Officials said several landslides and power outages occurred, but there have been no immediate reports of major damage."
wildfires,"Thousands of homes, a university campus, a nuclear plant, a Legoland and parts of one of the military's biggest and busiest bases: All have been evacuated due to a rare confluence of fast-moving wildfires scorching Southern California.
Cal Fire Division Chief Dave Allen said nine fires have burned 9,095 acres.
The Golden State has seen many such blazes before. But these are different because they sprung up so quickly, spread so fast, and hit months before the traditional height of wildfire season, making them menacing in the short- and long-term.
CNN meteorologist Jennifer Gray forecasts what the area might expect as the summer gives way to fall: ""This is only going to get worse.""
San Diego County district supervisor Bill Horn said Wednesday evening that eight fires were burning in the region, seven of which popped up that day.
Investigators haven't yet determined the cause of these fires. But Horn hasn't seen anything like this -- so many fires, so quick, all of them separate -- in at least 20 years. That this is happening in May, not July or October, is even more confounding to him.
""I'm sure it could be by chance,"" the clearly skeptical supervisor said. ""... I just think there's too much of a coincidence here.""
Whatever the cause -- whether it's a person or Mother Nature -- the impact is already being felt.
Carlsbad alone has issued 23,000 evacuation notices. Thousands of students won't have classes on Thursday due to the continuing threat; California State University-San Marcos canceled all activities through Friday, including commencement. Numerous roads have been shut down, while others have become clogged with people trying to escape.

Almost 200 people have been infected since the virus was first detected at the city's busy airport on 20 July.
All flights from Nanjing airport will be suspended until 11 August, according to local media.
Officials also began city-wide testing amid criticism for their ""failure"".
All 9.3 million of the city's residents - including those visiting - will be tested, said state-controlled Xinhua news.
Posts on social media show long lines of people queuing, and authorities have reportedly urged people to wear masks, stand one metre apart and avoid talking while they wait.
Officials said the highly contagious Delta variant of the virus was behind the infections, adding that cases had spread further because of how busy the airport is.
Ding Jie, a health official in Nanjing, told reporters the cases were linked to cleaners who worked on a flight from Russia that arrived in the city on 10 July.
The cleaners did not follow strict hygiene measures, Xinhua News reported.
The airport management has been rebuked, with a senior disciplinary body of the Communist Party saying it had ""problems such as lack of supervision and unprofessional management"".
Testing has shown that the virus has now spread to at least 13 cities including Chengdu and the capital Beijing.
However, experts quoted by the Global Times said they believed the outbreak was still at an early stage and could be controlled.
Local officials in Nanjing said that seven of those infected were in critical condition.
The new spike in cases has led some on Chinese social media to speculate about whether the Chinese vaccines were working against the Delta variant.
It is unclear if those infected were vaccinated.
A number of South East Asian countries relying on Chinese vaccines have recently announced they will use other jabs.
China has so far managed to keep the virus largely under control by closing borders and moving quickly to stamp out local outbreaks."

Since the April 2017 MPS, the S$NEER has fluctuated around a strengthening trend in the upper half of the policy band. The mild appreciation over the past six months reflected, in part, broad-based US dollar weakness and the depreciation of a number of regional currencies against the S$.

China has stepped up its military activity near Taiwan, including holding assault drills last week near the island, which it regards as Chinese territory to be brought under Beijing's control, by force if necessary.
President Tsai Ing-wen's Cabinet is proposing military spending of about $16.9 billion for the year starting in January, up from this year's budget of 16.2 billion, the government said in a statement.
That number includes $1.4 billion for new fighter jets. The government did not give details but is likely referring to F-16s.
he United States in 2019 approved an $8 billion sale of F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan, a deal that would bring the island's total to more than 200, the largest F-16 fleet in Asia.
The rate of increase would be smaller than the 10% rise budgeted for this year, according to Reuters calculations based on government data.
China in March said its 2021 defense spending would rise 6.8% from 2020, as the world's second-largest economy emerges from the repercussions of the coronavirus pandemic.
Taiwan's proposed defense budget is the third-largest government expenditure for next year, after social welfare and combined spending on education, science and culture.
The budget must be approved by Parliament, where Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party has a large majority, making its approval easier.
Tsai has made modernizing Taiwan's armed forces -- well-armed, but dwarfed by China's -- and increasing defense spending a priority.
Part of that is a making Taiwan a ""porcupine"" equipped with advanced, highly mobile weapons to make a Chinese invasion as difficult as possible."
earthquake,"Tsunami alerts were mistakenly sent to Anchorage after 7.8 earthquake off Alaska Peninsula, officials say Tuesday’s magnitude 7.8 earthquake off the Alaska Peninsula didn’t warrant the sending of tsunami alerts as far as Anchorage, the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center said Wednesday. The warnings were justified for coastal communities where they prompted evacuations for communities like Homer and Kodiak, but geologists told Alaska Public Media it was unlikely the quake could have generated a large tsunami in Anchorage, about 500 miles northeast of its epicenter. Dave Snider, the tsunami warning coordinator at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which operates the Tsunami Warning Center, said it’s unclear why AT&T customers in Anchorage - and potentially customers of other providers - received the erroneous alerts on Tuesday night. ""I'm very concerned about that, and that would go for any type of alert,"" Snider told Alaska Public Media. ""If you're getting a message that doesn't apply to you, the 'cry wolf' issue is certainly alive and present."
wildfires,"A massive brushfire, the worst in Israel’s history, raged unchecked for more than eight hours Thursday, burning thousands of acres of land, forcing villages to evacuate, and killing up to 40 people when their bus was engulfed in flames. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the blaze as “a catastrophe, the likes of which we have not yet known”.
He appealed to Russia, Cyprus, Greece and Italy for help in putting out the fire, which began on the slopes of the Carmel hill, southeast of Israel’s port city of Haifa, and rapidly spread.
Cyprus and Greece agreed to dispatch firefighting helicopters.
Some nine hours after the blaze was estimated to have begun exhausted firefighters, those from Haifa reinforced by teams from all over Israel, and by soldiers, were still struggling to bring it under control, but without success.
“We’ve lost control of the fire,” a spokesman for Haifa’s firefighting services was quoted as saying.
Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovich said it was impossible to say when the fire could be brought under control. However, firefighters were speculated that as the fire spread west a major road linking Haifa with Tel Aviv to the south could act as a natural firebreak, or, failing that, the sea would.
At least 22 people were confirmed dead, but other accounts put the number as high as 40.
The fatalities were prison guards who had been drafted to help evacuate the 500 prisoners from a jail in the path of the flames. Their bus, with 50 people on board, was trapped by a falling tree and 40 of them burned to death. The others were injured.
The fire had been far from the road when the bus first set off, but spread about 1,500 metres in less than three minutes."

Tropical Storm Hanna is forecast to be a Category 1 hurricane with sustained winds of 75 mph when it makes landfall along the south-central coast of Texas, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida. ""Steady strengthening is forecast for the next 24 hours, and Hanna is expected to become a hurricane before the cyclone makes landfall,"" according to an advisory from the hurricane center.

""Storms like Hanna in the Gulf of Mexico are notoriously the hardest to forecast,"" CNN meteorologist Chad Myers says. ""The water is so warm under the storm that rapid intensification can happen at any time, especially overnight when atmospheric shear goes down naturally. "" Shear is the changing of wind speed and direction with height and can inhibit hurricanes from forming. If Hanna strengthens into a hurricane, it will be the first hurricane of the season in the Atlantic. As of 10 p.m. Friday, the storm was 165 miles (270 km) east-southeast of Corpus Christi, Texas. An eye is beginning to form based off radar imagery, the hurricane center said, which means the storm is better organized and developing a stronger core structure."
other,"Under these circumstances, arguably only monetary policy can ¡°get in all of the cracks¡± to plug the vulnerabilities. An increase in short-term interest rates will trigger a more realistic evaluation of asset and collateral values, income flows, and, thus, risks. This will curtail the extent of leverage created by banks and capital markets and keep asset managers from crowding into risky assets. The effects of monetary policy are all-pervasive and cannot be easily circumvented.This approach, if formalized, amounts to augmenting the Taylor rule with an additional term to capture deviations in financial variables from their equilibrium levels. If financial-market imbalances are growing, ceteris paribus, monetary policy should be tightened, even if it causes further deviations in actual output from potential output in the short run. This approach does not preclude the need for robust financial regulation and supervision. But the key is to get the price of money right, and to encourage a more realistic perception and tolerance of risks.While no central bank currently implements monetary policy in this way, the concept behind the approach may not be as abstract as it seems. In practice, central bankers do not ignore financial-stability considerations when setting monetary policy.

Typhoon,"Inhabitants of the Korean peninsula are cleaning up after one powerful typhoon and preparing for another that could be particularly damaging to North Korea, which is still recovering from earlier floods.
The first storm, typhoon Bolaven, left at least 12 people dead in South Korea, including eight fishermen killed in wrecks off the southern coast. The extent of the damage in North Korea, which was hit late on Tuesday and early on Wednesday, was not completely clear, although state media reported that the storm knocked out power, submerged roads and houses and ruined farmland.
Typhoon Tembin was expected to reach South Korea on Thursday, with its outer bands hitting North Korea later in the day.
Tembin is expected to weaken as it reaches North Korea. Heavy rain, however, often means catastrophe in the north because of poor drainage, deforestation and decrepit infrastructure.

Despite the strong employment growth, the unemployment rate has increased to 5.2 per cent, where it has remained for three months. Domestic inflation pressures remain subdued. Housing-related inflation has been particularly soft lately, compounding the ongoing effects of spare capacity in the labour market and the resulting slow growth in labour costs.GDP growth is likely to have troughed around the middle of this year and is expected to reach about 2_ per cent over 2019. It is expected to pick up gradually to 2_ per cent over 2020, and around 3 per cent over 2021, which is a little higher than previously forecast. Growth is expected to be supported by a number of factors, including lower interest rates and recent tax measures. The established housing markets in some cities are showing signs of a turnaround, which should support spending. The mining sector is also likely to support output growth; in the near term, resource exports are recovering from recent supply disruptions, while a pick-up in mining investment will boost growth further out."

Turning to Q4, second advance estimates of the Ministry of Agriculture indicate that despite acutely low reservoir levels and a deficient north-east monsoon, rabi foodgrains production increased over its level a year ago _ mainly in wheat and pulses _ and compensated partly for the shortfall in kharif output. Unseasonal rains and hail in March are likely to have damaged some winter crops, particularly wheat, although full estimates of the crop loss await  advance estimates. On the other hand, fertiliser production has picked up, and horticulture as well as allied activities have remained resilient, suggesting that the implicit estimate of GVA for agricultural and allied activities in Q4 in the CSO¡¯s advance estimates is likely to be achieved, if not revised upwards.Value added in industry accelerated in H2, led by manufacturing which benefited from the sustained softness in input costs. By contrast, industrial production remained flat with manufacturing output shrinking since November. Robust expansion in coal output has buoyed both mining activity and electricity generation and stemmed the weakening of industrial output. However, capital goods production fell into deep contraction since November, even after excluding lumpy and volatile items like rubber insulated cable. Weak demand and competition from imports have muted the capex cycle. Consumer non-durables production has been shrinking, with a pronounced decline in Q4. This reflects the continuing slack in rural demand. On the other hand, consumer durables remained strong, even after abstracting from favourable base effects, which suggests that urban demand is holding up. With improved perceptions on overall economic conditions and income, the Reserve Bank¡¯s Consumer Confidence Survey of March 2016 shows marginal improvement in consumer sentiments. The March manufacturing purchasing managers¡¯ index (PMI) continued in expansionary mode on the back of new orders, including exports. The Reserve Bank¡¯s industrial outlook survey suggests that business expectations for Q1 of 2016-17 continue to be positive.Services sector activity expanded steadily through the year, with trade, hotels, transport, communication and public administration, defence and related services turning out to be the main drivers in H2. The construction sector continues to be overburdened by unsold inventory in the residential space, although commercial real estate is being boosted by demand from information technology (IT) and IT-enabled services. Road construction has accelerated, including in terms of new awards. Cement production appears to have gained traction during H2, while steel consumption has increased at a steady pace. Various lead and coincident indicators such as air passenger traffic, air cargo volumes, foreign tourist arrivals and auto sales increased, while railway freight traffic marginally contracted. The services PMI remained in expansion mode during H2 on new business and expectations. The outlook for services in surveys is upbeat for Q1 of 2016-17."
other,"Restrictions across the U.K. have been lifted over recent months following a monthlong winter lockdown and the rapid rollout of vaccines. Much of the British economy, which shrank around 10% in 2020, has reopened though an array of social distancing restrictions remain in place.However, the most recent easing due to begin this week was delayed by a month because of a resurgence in the virus, this one the more contagious delta variant. Now, the British government hopes to lift all remaining restrictions on social contact on July 19. The other nations of the U.K. ¡ª Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland ¡ª have been broadly coming out of lockdown in the same way as England.The committee said the ¡°direct economic implications¡± of the delay were ¡°likely to be relatively small compared with the impact of the re-openings of retail and hospitality activities that had already occurred.¡±The committee also appeared to take a fairly sanguine view on the recent spike in inflation.

other,"Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi has denied a report that it was considering going private to appease Chinese authorities.
Its shares had soared by almost 50% in Thursday's pre-market trade after the Wall Street Journal report.
Since making its US market debut a month ago the company has been targeted by authorities in Beijing.
Meanwhile, some US senators have called on its financial markets regulator to investigate Chinese share listings.
""The rumors about the privatization of Didi are untrue, and the company is currently actively cooperating with cybersecurity reviews,"" the company said on Chinese social media platform Weibo.
The statement came in response to a Wall Street Journal report, which cited people familiar with the matter as saying Didi was considering delisting its share in the US as it faced increasing pressure from regulators in China.
Two days after Didi shares started trading on the New York Stock Exchange, China's internet regulator ordered online stores not to offer its app, saying it illegally collected users' personal data.
That sent the company's market value down sharply and it has now fallen by around a third since Didi raised $4.4bn (£3.15bn) in its initial public offering (IPO) a month ago.
On Thursday, a group of Republican senators called on the country's financial markets regulator to launch an inquiry into US-listed Chinese companies.
In the letter to the head of Securities and Exchanges Commission the seven lawmakers cited losses sustained by Didi investors after Beijing's took action against the company.
In recent months Chinese technology companies traded in the US, Hong Kong and mainland China have seen their share prices slump as Beijing tightens its grip on the industry.
Just this week authorities have cracked down on a range of online services from food delivery apps to music streaming platforms.
Didi shares ended Thursday's US trading day up by 11.3%."
other,"Inflation expectations of households, measured by the December 2018 round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s survey, softened by 80 basis points for the three-month ahead horizon and by 130 basis points for the twelve-month ahead horizon over the last round, reflecting the continued decline in food and fuel prices. Producers¡¯ assessment of inflation in input prices eased in Q3 as reported by manufacturing firms polled by the Reserve Bank¡¯s industrial outlook survey.Inflation in the prices of farm inputs and industrial raw materials remained elevated, despite some softening. Growth in rural wages moderated in October.The weighted average call rate (WACR) traded below the policy repo rate on 12 out of 20 days in December, all 23 days in January and 4 days in February (up to February 6). The WACR was below the repo rate on an average by 4 basis points in December and 11 basis points each in January and February. Currency in circulation expanded sharply during December and January. The liquidity needs arising out of expansion in currency were met by the Reserve Bank through injection of durable liquidity amounting to _500 billion each in December and January through purchases under open market operations (OMOs). Accordingly, total durable liquidity injected through OMOs has aggregated _2.36 trillion during 2018-19 so far. Liquidity injected under the LAF was _996 billion in December on an average daily net basis, and _329 billion in January. In February, however, the average daily liquidity position turned into surplus with an average absorption of _279 billion.Export growth on a y-o-y basis was almost flat in November and December 2018, primarily due to a high base effect and weak global demand. While growth in exports of petroleum products remained positive, non-oil exports declined, dragged down by lower shipments of gems and jewellery, engineering goods, meat and poultry. Import growth slowed in November and turned negative in December 2018. While imports of petroleum (crude and products) rose in line with the increase in import volumes, non-oil imports such as pearls and precious stones, gold, electronic goods and transport equipment, recorded declines. The merchandise trade deficit for April-December 2018 was a shade higher than its level a year ago. Net services exports picked up in October and November 2018, which combined with low oil prices, could have a salutary impact on the current account deficit in Q3. On the financing side, net FDI flows to India during April-November 2018 were higher than a year ago. Foreign portfolio flows turned negative in January 2019, after rebounding in November and December 2018. India¡¯s foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 400.2 billion on February 1, 2019."
other,"As described in the February Monetary Policy Report, in August, the Committee unanimously adopted its revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. Our revised statement shares many features with its predecessor. For example, we have not changed our 2 percent longer-run inflation goal. However, we did make some key changes. Regarding our employment goal, we emphasize that maximum employment is a broad and inclusive goal. This change reflects our appreciation for the benefits of a strong labor market, particularly for low- and moderate-income communities. In addition, we state that our policy decisions will be informed by our ""assessments of shortfalls of employment from its maximum level"" rather than by ""deviations from its maximum level.""1 This change means that we will not tighten monetary policy solely in response to a strong labor market. Regarding our price-stability goal, we state that we will seek to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time. This means that, following periods when inflation has been running below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time. With this change, we aim to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at our 2 percent goal. Well-anchored inflation expectations enhance our ability to meet both our employment and inflation goals, particularly in the current low interest rate environment in which our main policy tool is likely to be more frequently constrained by the lower bound.We have implemented our new framework by forcefully deploying our policy tools. As noted in our January policy statement, we expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current accommodative target range of the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities at least at their current pace until substantial further progress has been made toward our goals. These purchases, and the associated increase in the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, have materially eased financial conditions and are providing substantial support to the economy. The economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved. We will continue to clearly communicate our assessment of progress toward our goals well in advance of any change in the pace of purchases.Since the onset of the pandemic, the Federal Reserve has been taking actions to support more directly the flow of credit in the economy, deploying our emergency lending powers to an unprecedented extent, enabled in large part by financial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury. Although the CARES Act (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act) facilities are no longer open to new activity, our other facilities remain in place.We understand that our actions affect households, businesses, and communities across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help ensure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible."
drought,"The European Commission has announced new humanitarian assistance of €60 million to help people in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya, who have been facing critical levels of food insecurity due to severe drought.
This additional assistance brings EU humanitarian aid to the Horn of Africa region (including Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Djibouti) to nearly €260 million since the beginning of 2017.
""The situation in Horn of Africa has drastically deteriorated in 2017 and it keeps getting worse. Millions of people are struggling to meet their and their families' food needs. The risk of famine is real. The European Union has been following the situation closely since the very beginning and progressively increasing aid to the affected populations. This new package will help our humanitarian partners scale up the response further and keep bringing lifesaving assistance to people in need,"" said Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management Christos Stylianides.
The Horn of Africa region has been affected by prolonged drought brought on by a succession of failed rains. The most badly affected areas are south-eastern Ethiopia, northern Kenya, and Somalia where a pre-famine alert has been issued. Some 17 million people are in urgent need of food to survive, while the countries' coping capacities are exhausted. To further compound the situation, all three countries are grappling with a cholera outbreak.
EU humanitarian partners are already on the ground responding to the needs of the affected populations. The additional €60 million in EU assistance will support humanitarian partners in stepping up emergency food assistance and treatment of malnutrition. The aid will also support projects addressing water supply, livestock protection and response to disease outbreaks. The bulk of the funding (€40 million) will help the most vulnerable people in Somalia, while €15 million will go to Ethiopia and €5 million to Kenya."
flood,"Central Vietnam flooding death toll rises to 88 t least 88 people have died and around 53,000 families have been evacuated as of Monday morning in the flooding and landslides in central Vietnam. For nearly two weeks the region has been suffering from heavy rains, floods and landslides triggered by a meeting of a cold spell from the north and the intertropical convergence zone.  The central and Central Highlands regions have been devastated with 12 national highways and over 17.4 km of local roads being damaged, most severely in Thua Thien-Hue, Quang Tri and Quang Nam provinces, the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention said.  In Ha Tinh Province, hundreds of houses have been flooded and infrastructure has been severely damaged since Friday. In Can Loc District, authorities found on Sunday afternoon the body of Tran Van Doan, 36, who had been swept away by floodwaters in Thien Loc Commune on Friday.  The 86 dead include many landslide victims - two workers buried at a hydropower plant in Thua Thien-Hue on Monday last week, and 13 others on a rescue team dispatched to find the hydropower plant workers who were hit by a different landslide on Tuesday.  Another landslide in Quang Tri buried 22 people on Sunday morning. As of Monday morning 17 have been confirmed dead while the five others remained missing."

other,"The U.S. economy delivered a solid performance in 2005 despite a further sharp increase in energy prices and devastating hurricanes that claimed many lives, destroyed homes and businesses, and displaced more than 1 million persons. Real gross domestic product is estimated to have risen a little more than 3 percent over the four quarters of 2005 even though growth slowed significantly in the fourth quarter as a result of storm-related disruptions and other factors that are likely to prove transitory. The increase in real GDP in 2005 was sufficient to add 2 million new jobs, on net, to employers' payrolls and to further reduce slack in labor and product markets. As in 2004, overall consumer price inflation was boosted by the surge in energy prices. Core consumer price inflation (as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding the direct effects of movements in food and energy prices) picked up early in the year, but it subsequently eased and totaled less than 2 percent over the year as a whole. The dollar appreciated against most major currencies in 2005, and, with domestic demand expanding strongly, the U.S. current account deficit widened further."
valcano eruption,"Biggest volcano explosion yet rocks tiny Caribbean island Hot flows of ash, rock fragments and gas tore down the flanks of the La Soufriere volcano on the tiny Caribbean island of Saint Vincent on Monday after its most powerful explosion yet, four days after it first started erupting. La Soufriere erupted back into life on Friday after decades of inactivity, pumping dark clouds of ash some 10 km (6 miles) into the air and prompting an evacuation by sea and land of thousands of nearby residents. No deaths have been reported so far but a roughly a third of the island is off limits and airspace remains closed while power and water supply is intermittent in some communities. Several Vincentians told Reuters they were avoiding venturing outdoors as the ash was clogging the air and turning into what looked like cement in the rain, making it difficult to walk or drive."
wildfires,"A fast-growing wildfire along the Pacific Coast Highway northwest of Los Angeles nearly doubled in size Friday and was threatening more than 4,000 homes as crews battled strong winds, tinder-dry conditions and record-breaking temperatures.
The Springs Fire had burned more than 28,000 acres of rugged, brush-covered terrain by late afternoon and was 20% contained, the state's fire agency reported.
Forecasters said a weekend of increased humidity should help teams fighting the early-season blaze make gains Saturday.
""It's a total turnaround from what we had,"" said Kurt Kaplan, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Oxnard. ""It should be a much better day for firefighters tomorrow.""
At midday Friday, the temperature hit a record 96 in Camarillo, where the blaze began, about 50 miles north of Los Angeles.
Thousands of residents had already evacuated the Ventura County fire, including 118 families ordered from a premier Navy base because of heavy smoke after flames jumped the scenic highway.
The fire began Thursday during the morning rush hour near U.S. 101, which is the major commuter route into Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley. After reaching the coast overnight, the fire headed back inland Friday.
The fire had damaged 15 homes and destroyed at least 25 outbuildings and other property by midday. Large animals and livestock were being taken to the county fairgrounds.
No operations were affected Friday morning at the sprawling Naval Base Ventura County, which was already operating on an ""essential mission"" basis. The base has a population of more than 19,000 personnel and operates two runways, a sea-test range and deep-water port.
The evacuation order only affected the San Miguel housing unit for the Point Mugu air station. ""This is due to smoke, rather than fire, concerns,"" public affairs officer Kimberly Gearhart announced on the base's Facebook page."
other,"Since my appearance before this Committee last June, the economy has continued to make progress toward our dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability. In the labor market, job gains averaged 190,000 per month over the second half of 2016, and the number of jobs rose an additional 227,000 in January. Those gains bring the total increase in employment since its trough in early 2010 to nearly 16 million. In addition, the unemployment rate, which stood at 4.8 percent in January, is more than 5 percentage points lower than where it stood at its peak in 2010 and is now in line with the median of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants' estimates of its longer-run normal level. A broader measure of labor underutilization, which includes those marginally attached to the labor force and people who are working part time but would like a full-time job, has also continued to improve over the past year. In addition, the pace of wage growth has picked up relative to its pace of a few years ago, a further indication that the job market is tightening. Importantly, improvements in the labor market in recent years have been widespread, with large declines in the unemployment rates for all major demographic groups, including African Americans and Hispanics. Even so, it is discouraging that jobless rates for those minorities remain significantly higher than the rate for the nation overall.Ongoing gains in the labor market have been accompanied by a further moderate expansion in economic activity. U.S. real gross domestic product is estimated to have risen 1.9 percent last year, the same as in 2015. Consumer spending has continued to rise at a healthy pace, supported by steady income gains, increases in the value of households' financial assets and homes, favorable levels of consumer sentiment, and low interest rates. Last year's sales of automobiles and light trucks were the highest annual total on record. In contrast, business investment was relatively soft for much of last year, though it posted some larger gains toward the end of the year in part reflecting an apparent end to the sharp declines in spending on drilling and mining structures; moreover, business sentiment has noticeably improved in the past few months. In addition, weak foreign growth and the appreciation of the dollar over the past two years have restrained manufacturing output. Meanwhile, housing construction has continued to trend up at only a modest pace in recent quarters. And, while the lean stock of homes for sale and ongoing labor market gains should provide some support to housing construction going forward, the recent increases in mortgage rates may impart some restraint.Inflation moved up over the past year, mainly because of the diminishing effects of the earlier declines in energy prices and import prices. Total consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index rose 1.6 percent in the 12 months ending in December, still below the FOMC's 2 percent objective but up 1 percentage point from its pace in 2015. Core PCE inflation, which excludes the volatile energy and food prices, moved up to about 1-3/4 percent.My colleagues on the FOMC and I expect the economy to continue to expand at a moderate pace, with the job market strengthening somewhat further and inflation gradually rising to 2 percent. This judgment reflects our view that U.S. monetary policy remains accommodative, and that the pace of global economic activity should pick up over time, supported by accommodative monetary policies abroad. Of course, our inflation outlook also depends importantly on our assessment that longer-run inflation expectations will remain reasonably well anchored. It is reassuring that while market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low, they have risen from the very low levels they reached during the latter part of 2015 and first half of 2016. Meanwhile, most survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations have changed little, on balance, in recent months.As always, considerable uncertainty attends the economic outlook. Among the sources of uncertainty are possible changes in U.S. fiscal and other policies, the future path of productivity growth, and developments abroad."
drought,"Residents call this drought-stricken community a “forgotten town.”
The flat, dusty roads to Vosburg are surrounded by withered fields. The streams feeding the community of a few thousand people have gone dry. Signs warn drivers of wandering cattle and sheep but there are none in sight.
The months-long drought is affecting most of southern Africa. The United Nations estimates that more than 11 million people now face crisis levels of food insecurity in places like Zimbabwe and Mozambique, where two cyclones wiped out crops earlier this year.
Among the hardest hit areas is South Africa’s Northern Cape province, where many farmers are struggling to keep their families and animals alive while revenue falls and debt piles up.
Commercial sheep farmer Louis van der Merwe, 64, broke down as he described losing more than 400 sheep and 450 springboks in the past two years because of the worst drought he has seen in 45 years of farming.
Some animals died of hunger. Others were sent prematurely to the slaughterhouse to reduce the number to feed. With tears running down his face, Van der Merwe said he now relies on donations of animal feed so the rest can survive.
“If we didn’t have hope, we would not be here anymore,” he said. “We have to have hope and faith. There are a couple of times when we have felt it is not worth it.”
Two of his fellow farmers have killed themselves due to the stress, Van der Merwe said.
Northern Cape province will need over 28 million in drought relief over the next three months to assist 15,500 affected farms, according to farmers’organization Agri-SA.
So far, South Africa’s government has pledged 2 million.
The World Food Program says southern Africa has received normal rainfall in just one of the past five growing seasons, with small-scale farmers feeling it most.
Some like 55-year-old Gertruida Buffel, have resorted to sharing their own food with their animals.
For two weeks she had fed two tiny lambs a mixture of maize meal and water after their mother starved to death. When The Associated Press arrived at her home, she had just learned that one had died."

wildfires,"SYDNEY (BLOOMBERG) - Australia is in the grip of deadly wildfires burning across the country, triggering an emotive debate about the impact of climate change in the world's driest-inhabited continent. The unprecedented scale of the crisis, and images of terrified tourists sheltering on beaches from the inferno, have shocked many Australians.
With summer only just beginning and the nation affected by a prolonged drought, the authorities fear the death toll will continue to mount as more homes and land are destroyed. Here are some key details of the crisis:
How many people have died?
Since the fire season began months ago during the southern hemisphere winter, 23 people have died. With six people missing in Victoria state, the authorities fear the death toll will rise. Among the fatalities are volunteer firefighters, including a young man who died when his 10-tonne truck was flipped over in what officials have described as a ""fire tornado"". Australia's worst wildfires came in 2009 when the Black Saturday blazes left 180 people dead."
earthquake,"Japan's most powerful earthquake since records began has struck the north-east coast, triggering a massive tsunami.
Cars, ships and buildings were swept away by a wall of water after the 8.9-magnitude tremor, which struck about 400km (250 miles) north-east of Tokyo.
A state of emergency has been declared at a nuclear power plant, where pressure has exceeded normal levels.
Officials say 350 people are dead and about 500 missing, but it is feared the final death toll will be much higher.
In one ward alone in Sendai, a port city in Miyagi prefecture, 200 to 300 bodies were found.
The quake was the fifth-largest in the world since 1900 and nearly 8,000 times stronger than the one which devastated Christchurch, New Zealand, last month, said scientists.
Thousands of people living near the Fukushima nuclear power plant have been ordered to evacuate.
Japanese nuclear officials said pressure inside a boiling water reactor at the plant was running much higher than normal after the cooling system failed.
Officials said they might need to deliberately release some radioactive steam to relieve pressure, but that there would be no health risk.
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had earlier said the US Air Force had flown emergency coolant to the site."

valcano eruption,"Why the New Zealand volcano eruption caught the world by surprise The explosive event was “the actual worst-case scenario,” geologists report. On Monday, at 2:11 p.m. local time, an explosive eruption rocked White Island, a small volcanic isle in New Zealand’s Bay of Plenty. A series of violent blasts rang out, flinging ash 12,000 feet into the sky and showering the volcano’s floor with hot debris, before everything fell silent a handful of minutes later. It quickly became apparent that lives were lost. A number of tourists were on the island at the time, several of whom were right next to the volcano’s active vent. At the time of writing, five deaths have been officially recorded, with several more people still unaccounted for. Recent reconnaissance flights over the island, also known by its Māori name Whakaari, have found no signs of life."
other,"¡°Initially, the low-interest rate policies of the Fed and the policies of the Nixon administration seemed to work in the early 1970s,¡± says George Selgin, a Cato Institute economist. Nixon, he notes, won easy re-election in 1972.These policies initially seemed to produce prosperity.Later, Selgin noted, prices of necessities shot up. It was ¡°shocking,¡± he says.It was also unprecedented. Prices rose at an alarming double-digit rate but the economy stopped growing. That¡¯s something economists previously said couldn¡¯t happen simultaneously. It led to a new term: stagflation.Most analysts agree politics, not the rising price of oil, caused stagflation. In 1970 Nixon, looking to the 1972 elections as was most of Congress, sought policies that would reverse the recession of the late 1960s just as governments today use spending and the Fed to restart the economy.Nixon ended the Bretton Woods agreement. That broke the last dollar link to gold. Gutting Bretton Woods cheapened the dollar. Foreigners holding dollars were short-changed.It also meant that ¡°the check on the government¡¯s ability to increase the quantity of money¡ªthe gold standard_is gone,¡± wrote Bruce Bartlett in the book ¡°Reaganomics.¡± Government, he added, now had a ¡°powerful interest in maintaining a steady rate of inflation.¡± Once stagflation began, it was difficult to stop, historians note.Three presidents, Nixon, Ford, and Carter, struggled with solving stagflation. ¡°Nothing seemed to work,¡± wrote economist Robert Sobel in ¡°The Worldly Economists.¡±"

""The Rough Fire is now the 18th largest fire in our state's history and over the past several months has been primarily burning in the national forest,"" says Daniel Berlant, with Cal Fire.
Berlant says Cal Fire crews will work with U.S. Forest Service firefighters as the fire spreads. 
""Now it is starting to come off of the national forest and threaten private lands that we are responsible for protecting,"" says Berlant. ""We are bringing in additional resources to help keep the communities in Fresno County safe and to do our part to assist in containing this fire."" 
New evacuations and road closures were issued Friday.
There are more than 2,200 firefighters working the Rough Fire, which was started by lightning in July.

other,"Global financial markets continued to be affected by monetary policy stances in major AEs, the spreading of contagion risks from specific EMEs, and geopolitical developments. Among AEs, equity markets in the US touched a new high, driven by technology stocks, while in Japan, they were boosted by the weak yen. In contrast, stock markets in the Euro area suffered losses on signs of a slowdown and budget concerns in some member states. Sharp sell-offs have occurred on waning appetite of foreign portfolio investors for EME equities. The 10-year sovereign yield in the US has traded sideways, falling on dovish Fed guidance only to recover by end-September on robust economic data. Among other AEs, bond yields in the Euro area hardened in September on risk aversion following the sharp rise in financial market volatility in August. In contrast, bond yields in Japan moved in a narrow range, driven by the central bank¡¯s yield curve management policy. In most EMEs, yields rose due to domestic factors and/or contagion effects from the stress in other EMEs. In currency markets, the US dollar witnessed selling pressures since August on reduced investor expectations of rate hikes by the US Fed. However, it recovered in the last week of September on a rate hike by the Fed and strong economic data. The euro remained in bearish territory due to fiscal risks in some member countries and expectations of weak growth. EME currencies continued to depreciate against the US dollar.On the domestic front, real gross domestic product (GDP) growth surged to a nine-quarter high of 8.2 per cent in Q1:2018-19, extending the sequential acceleration to four successive quarters. Of the constituents, gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) expanded by double digits for the second consecutive quarter, driven by the government¡¯s focus on the road sector and affordable housing. Growth in private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) accelerated to 8.6 per cent, reflecting rising rural and urban spending, supported by retail credit growth. However, government final consumption expenditure (GFCE) decelerated, largely due to a high base. The growth of exports of goods and services jumped to 12.7 per cent, powered by non-oil exports on the back of strong global demand. In spite of import growth continuing to surge, high exports growth helped reduce the drag from net exports on aggregate demand."

The quake occurred at 12:09 a.m. local time at a depth of 35 kilometers (22 miles). It was centered 78 kilometers (48 miles) northeast of the Atacama city of Vallenar. A few minutes later, a second quake occurred with a preliminary magnitude of 6.3.
The quake was felt as far south as the capital, Santiago, and in Antofagasta, 1,330 kilometers (826 miles) further north.
Video from the scene showed windows rattling and items falling to the ground. Local radio stations reported that boulders broke off hills. The electricity was briefly cut off.
Chile is located in the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire and often experiences large earthquake. The last major quake, on Feb. 27, 2010, set off tsunamis and killed 526 people."
other,"Since the April 2017 meeting of the MPC, global economic activity has expanded at a modest pace, supported by firming growth in major advanced economies (AEs) and in some emerging market economies (EMEs) as well. In the US, a tightening labour market is generating wage gains. Alongside, industrial production has steadily improved in recent months and retail sales remain robust, although home sales ebbed in April. Political risks remain high, however. In the Euro area, the recovery has been underpinned by consistently falling unemployment, rising retail sales and a brighter outlook for manufacturing reflected in purchasing managers¡¯ and business surveys. In Japan, exports supported by a depreciated yen and industrial activity are driving an acceleration in growth. Wages and inflation, however, are depressed and holding back domestic demand. Among EMEs, the Chinese economy is stabilising, especially in manufacturing, but financial risks in the form of the credit-fuelled debt overhang could impinge on the outlook. Brazil appears to be emerging out of recession, although growth dynamics remain fragile due to worsening labour market conditions and political turmoil. In Russia, the strengthening global environment is supporting the recovery with improving macro fundamentals. South Africa is grappling with structural constraints which are depressing economic activity.The pick-up in global merchandise trade volume since the start of the year has been sustained in Q2 of 2017, buoyed by strengthening global demand as reflected in rising international air freight and container throughput. Crude prices fell to a five-month low in early May on higher output from Canada and the US, and remain soft, undermining the OPEC¡¯s recent efforts to tighten the market by trimming supply. Among non-fuel commodity prices, metal prices have been retreating on expectations of weak demand from China. Bullion prices remain range-bound, while food prices eased in April but rose in May. These developments suggest that the inflation outlook is still relatively benign for AEs and EMEs alike."
other,"The global economy is likely to experience an extended period of slow growth.  Against this backdrop, the Singapore economy should continue to expand but at a modest pace in 2012 and 2013.  The labour market should remain tight.The appreciating stance of exchange rate policy since April 2010 has provided some restraint on the build-up of inflationary pressures, which in part reflects supply-side constraints in the economy.  MAS Core Inflation receded recently but will face upward pressure from higher food and services costs.  CPI-All Items inflation will remain elevated for some time.MAS will therefore maintain the policy of a modest and gradual appreciation of the S$NEER policy band.  There will be no change to the slope and width of the policy band, as well as the level at which it is centred.  This policy stance is assessed to be appropriate in containing inflationary pressures and keeping the economy on a path of restructuring towards sustainable growth.  MAS will continue to be vigilant in assessing external economic and financial developments, and their impact on the Singapore economy."
other,"The U.S. economy continued to expand at a moderate rate, on average, over the second half of 2012. The housing recovery appeared to gain additional traction, consumer spending rose moderately, and business investment advanced further. Financial conditions eased over the period but credit remained tight for many households and businesses, and concerns about the course of federal fiscal policy and the ongoing European situation likely restrained private-sector demand. In addition, total government purchases continued to move lower in an environment of budget restraint, while export growth was held back by slow foreign economic growth. All told, real gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have increased at an average annual rate of 1-1/2 percent in the second half of the year, similar to the pace in the first half."
Typhoon,"The National Weather Service has issued hurricane watches for Hawaii and Maui counties with Hurricane Lane barreling towards the islands having been upgraded to a Category 4 storm.
Lane has sustained winds of 150 miles per hour as of Tuesday morning local time, the National Weather Service of Honolulu said
“Major Hurricane Lane could bring significant impacts to the Hawaiian Islands late week and into the weekend,” officials said. “All residents in [Hawaii] are urged to stay abreast of the situation.”
Officials said it was too early to report which of the main Hawaiian islands would be directly impacted _ though they noted if the hurricane’s centre remained offshore its impacts could still extend well away from the centre. Intense showers and thunderstorms surrounding the hurricane are expected to reach the Big Island late on Tuesday night or Wednesday morning.
Senior Honolulu forecaster Tom Birchard said it’s possible island Oahu and Kaui could be included in a watch.
Officials have also issued tropical storm watches and flash flood watches for islands Kahoolawe, Kauai, Lanai, Maui, Molokai, Niihau, Oahu and the Big Island.
“As Hurricane Lane approaches the islands from the south, deep tropical moisture associated with Lane will spread across the island chain from the east, with increased potential for heavy rainfall,” officials said."
drought,"Just a few days ago, on January 26th, 2017, we saw something in the U.S. climate that we hadn’t seen since March 2011. Well, technically, we didn’t see something, I guess.
For the first time since March 2011, there was no D4, “exceptional drought,” anywhere in the United States, as analyzed by the U.S. Drought Monitor. The last vestige of D4—the most severe category in the monitoring system—disappeared from its southern California holdout, part of a larger pattern of substantial mid-January drought improvements in California.
With all that said, the bottom line is that the nation is in better shape drought-wise than it has been for most of this decade.
The recap
During late 2015, the West was in pretty dire straits. Drought enveloped most of the region, from border to border, Pacific to Rockies. Late 2015 wetness helped the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies, and by spring 2016, drought was almost eradicated there.
However, drought held through spring south of the San Francisco Bay, where summer presents almost zero chance of drought recovery. But things did improve in late fall, and the last month brought waves of rain and high-altitude snow that improved things even more."
other,"PFCE remained the mainstay of aggregate demand running ahead in Q1:2018-19 on the strength of rising rural and urban demand and undeterred by the surge in domestic prices of petroleum products. After rising since the beginning of 2017-18, wage (staff cost per employee) growth in the organised manufacturing and services sectors has remained range bound (see Chart II.20, Chapter II). However, in the information technology (IT) sector, growth in staff cost was robust in Q1:2018-19, which could have added to the purchasing power. In contrast, anecdotal evidence suggests that following a decline in exports and moderation in domestic production, growth in wage incomes could have moderated in some of the labour-intensive segments such as readymade garments, and jute manufactures, which, in turn, might have impacted consumption demand (Chart III.3).High frequency indicators of urban consumption present a mixed picture. While domestic air passenger traffic and production of consumer durables expanded during Q1 and Q2:2018-19 so far, sales of passenger cars contracted during July-August, after peaking in June, possibly as a response to the sharp rise in fuel prices (Chart III.4). Household credit demand in the form of personal loans and leasing of vehicles by commercial banks maintained a robust tempo (Chart III.5). Going forward, urban consumption is expected to strengthen further on the implementation of the 7th Central Pay Commission (CPC) awards by states and the recent reduction in GST rates.High frequency indicators of rural demand seem to be indicating a slight loss of momentum in Q2:2018- 19 (Chart III.6). Sales of motorcycles and tractors, which grew robustly during Q1:2018-19, decelerated in Q2 (July-August). Nevertheless, construction activity in rural areas has been buoyant since Q2:2017-18, supported by the government¡¯s thrust on rural housing and roads. Strong topline growth of FMCG companies, a sizeable part of which emanates from rural areas, also corroborates the improving dynamics of rural consumption. The latter should also benefit from the tailwinds of normal rains in large parts of the country, given the empirical evidence of a positive association of normal monsoon with growth in private consumption (Chart III.7).1 The sizeable increase in MSP of kharif crops announced in July 2018 is expected to augment incomes of rural households if it is implemented effectively."
drought,"Remember the California drought? It was all over the news a year ago, when the state took the unprecedented step of mandating statewide water cutbacks. The Sierra Nevada snowpack was at its lowest recorded level. Rivers and reservoirs were getting shallower and shallower. Wells in rural towns were literally running dry.
That drought is still very much a thing.
More than 62 percent of California remains in severe to exceptional drought conditions, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. And without a wet winter the state could be facing a sixth-consecutive year of severe drought.
""Absolutely we're still in a drought,"" says Peter Gleick, a co-founder of the Pacific Institute, a water think tank. ""We are way below normal. Our reservoirs are low. Our groundwater is still being grossly over-pumped.""
Problem is: People aren't acting like it — at least not quite like they did. And that's raising questions about how the drought is being messaged.
A year ago, when Governor Jerry Brown mandated a 25 percent water cutback, the message was dire and it was clear. Californians rose to the occasion. In August 2015, urban water consumption was cut by 27 percent statewide, compared to the same month in 2013."
other,"Efficient payment systems reduce the cost of exchanging goods and services and are indispensable to the functioning of financial markets. The past decade has witnessed several innovations in retail payments across the globe. Benchmarking India¡¯s Payments Systems is necessary to gauge India¡¯s progress against payment systems and instruments in major countries and give further impetus to the planned efforts for deepening the digitisation of payments. A report containing the findings of such an exercise will be placed on the RBI website by the end of May 2019.The Reserve Bank has directed various authorised payment systems to put in place appropriate customer grievance redressal mechanism. Further, for some payment systems the Reserve Bank has issued guidelines prescribing compensation to be paid to customers for delay in resolving failed transactions. It is, however, observed that the time taken for resolving customer complaint varies across payment systems. In order to have prompt and efficient customer service in all the electronic payment systems, it is necessary to harmonise the Turn Around Time (TAT) of resolution of customer complaints and chargebacks, and to have a compensation framework in place for the benefit of customers. The Reserve Bank proposes to put in place a framework on TAT for resolution of customer complaints and compensation framework across all authorised payment systems by the end of June 2019."
other,"The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere this year is likely to show one of the largest annual rises since measurements began in 1958, partly fuelled by Australian bushfires, according to research by Britain's Met Office.
The concentration of CO2 is expected to peak above 417 parts per million (ppm) this May, while the year's average is expected to be around 414 ppm, up to nearly 3 ppm above the average for last year.
Man-made emissions are the overall driver of the long-term rise in CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere, which is the main cause of climate change.
However, added to that, weather patterns linked to swings in Pacific Ocean temperatures are known to affect the uptake of CO2 by land ecosystems.
In years when there is a warmer tropical Pacific, many regions become warmer and drier, which limits the ability of plants to grow and absorb CO2 and increases the risk of wildfires, which release further emissions.
Along with other weather patterns and human-induced climate change, this has contributed to the recent hot, dry weather in Australia, which played a key role in the severity of bushfires, the Met Office said.
An unusually long bushfire season has scorched an area one-third the size of Germany in Australia.
The impact of weather patterns on ecosystems is expected to increase the rise in CO2 concentration by 10% this year and the emissions from the bushfires contribute up to one fifth of this increase, the Met Office said.
""Although the series of annual levels of CO2 have always seen a year-on-year increase since 1958, driven by fossil fuel burning and deforestation, the rate of rise isn’t perfectly even because there are fluctuations in the response of ecosystem carbon sinks, especially tropical forests,"" said Richard Betts, of the Met Office Hadley Centre
""Overall, these are expected to be weaker than normal for a second year running,"" he added."

other,"As noted, the NGDP gap requires an estimate of the neutral level of NGDP. The neutral level of NGDP is estimated by taking an average forecast of NGDP, or equivalent total nominal income, for a given quarter based on forecasts for that period from the preceding 20 quarters. The forecast data used here are taken from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia¡¯s Survey of Professional Forecasters.The NDGP gap measures the percentage difference between this average forecast and the actual level of NGDP. If the actual level of NGDP is less than the neutral level, then monetary conditions are contractionary. If actual NGDP is greater than the neutral level, then monetary conditions are expansionary.The rationale for this understanding is twofold. First, members of the public make many economic decisions, such as whether to take out a mortgage or a car loan, on the basis of forecasts of their nominal income. Similarly, firms may finance with debt and commit to multiyear contracts on plants, raw materials, and labor on the basis of forecasts of their nominal income. Second, actual nominal incomes may turn out to be very different from what are expected and, as a result, may be disruptive for households and firms that are not able to quickly adjust their economic plans. These disruptions can be avoided by maintaining total nominal income or NGDP on the growth path expected by the public. In other words, the Federal Reserve should aim to close the NGDP gap in order to keep monetary conditions neutral.To ensure robustness, I create a data series using real-time actual NGDP data (which are revised later). This series is called the vintage NGDP gap, and it contains initial-release NGDP data for each quarter. In other words, the series shows the NGDP gap, available in real time, given the initial NGDP data. In addition, I create a second version of the NGDP gap, the Blue Chip NGDP gap, using consensus forecasts from Blue Chip Economic Indicators instead of the Survey of Professional Forecasters. This measure provides a cross-check on the use of the Survey of Professional Forecasters. Both the vintage NGDP gap and the Blue Chip NGDP gap are shown in the figures below.For more information on how the NGDP gap is constructed and how it may be used to understand policy, please see ¡°The Stance of Monetary Policy: The NGDP Gap,¡± a policy brief by David Beckworth. Also, see the NGDP gap web page hosted by the Mercatus Center that provides access to current and vintage data on the NGDP gap.David Beckworth is the director of the Program on Monetary Policy at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University and a former international economist at the US Department of the Treasury.

Typhoon,"Just three weeks after a powerful earthquake shook the central area of the Philippines, the country has been hit by on of the most dangerous storms ever recorded. Typhoon Haiyan, known locally as Yolanda, made landfall on Friday with winds of around 300km/h and the diameter of up to 400 km, causing heavy rainfalls, flash floods and landslides. Despite preparedness measures taken by the national authorities devastation is vast, millions of people have been affected and the death toll is expected to be substantial. A team of ECHO humanitarian experts has been deployed on the ground and is conducting a rapid needs assessment with partner organisations. The European Commission stands ready to assist.
The Emergency Response and Coordination Centre (ERCC) of the European Commission's Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department ECHO is closely monitoring the situation. Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) reached the equivalent of a Hurricane Category 5 during its quick passage through the archipelago and is now heading towards Vietnam. Nearly 800 000 residents on the potentially affected areas were pre-emptively evacuated, including survivors of the island communities struck by the 7.2 magnitude earthquake on 15 October, who were staying in tent shelters, but humanitarian impact has nevertheless been high. Access to affected areas remains difficult, with power and telecommunications shutdowns in most of them as well.
The Philippines is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world, with 15 to 20 cyclones a year and major seismic upheavals, among other natural catastrophes. The European Commission has provided _42.7 million in disaster relief since 1997 and almost _8 million in preparedness.

drought,"For the first time, parts of Minnesota are in an ""exceptional"" drought as hot weather continues. 
According to the Minnesota Department of National Resources (DNR) Thursday, 7.37% of the state is in an exceptional drought classification while 42.2% of the state is in an extreme drought.
Most of the exceptional drought areas are in the northwest portion of the state. 
As a result of drought conditions, farmers are facing critical weeks ahead as they prepare to harvest crops.

MAS Core Inflation should also pick up more gradually over the course of 2016 than previously anticipated, and is now likely to fall below 2% on average over the medium term.  MAS will therefore set the rate of appreciation of the S$NEER policy band at zero percent, beginning 14 April 2016. This is not a policy to depreciate the domestic currency, and only removes the modest and gradual appreciation path of the S$NEER policy band that was in place.  The width of the policy band and the level at which it is centred will be unchanged.This move to a neutral policy stance of zero percent appreciation follows the measured steps that MAS has taken to reduce the rate of appreciation of the policy band in January and October 2015 respectively. [1]  The actual outcome of S$NEER movements over the six months since October 2015 has in fact been a zero percent appreciation compared to the preceding six-month period.

In some sectors, such as lower-rated corporate debt, valuations appear stretched and issuance has been brisk. Accordingly, we are closely monitoring developments in the leveraged loan market and are working to enhance the effectiveness of our supervisory guidance.

wildfires,"More than 640 fires have burned more than 3.2 million acres in Alaska this year, putting the state on pace for a record wildfire year. In 2004, Alaska’s worst fire season, about 6.6 million acres burned. More acres burned in the state last month than in June 2004.
The National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC), which makes predictions of the fire season for the federal government, expects the burning to continue. Wrote the agency:
“Alaska is in the heart of its fire season, and fire season could continue to be quite busy for another two months.”
The NIFC expects warmer temperatures and drier than normal conditions in the state.
Nearly one-third of all firefighters on active fires are in Alaska, according to the NIFC. More than 85 percent of acres burning are in Alaska.
According to a report from Climate Central, more fire is part of a trend: The fire season in Alaska is getting longer, the area burned is increasing and the number of large wildfires in the Arctic part of the state is growing.
Climate Central projects that the area burned in Alaska wildfires will double by mid-century.
More fires in the Arctic region are concerning to scientists because they could melt permafrost and release carbon that could accelerate global warming, said Todd Sanford, lead author of the study.
That’s because studies show wildfire can thaw permafrost beneath vegetation and soil and release sealed carbon, which could accelerate climate change though the effect is not certain.
Scientists are concerned that could create a feedback loop: More carbon in the atmosphere leading to warming temperatures, which thaws permafrost and leads to more carbon in the atmosphere."
drought,"More than 44 per cent of India's areas were under various degrees of drought conditions (abnormally dry to exceptionally dry) as of June 10, 2019 — that is nearly 11 percentage point over a year ago, according to the Drought Early Warning System (DEWS).
Within this, ‘severe to exceptionally dry conditions’ prevailed in 17.33 per cent area, according to the real-time drought monitoring platform.
While just 0.65 per cent of area had ‘exceptionally dry’ conditions in June 2018, it has now jumped to 5.87 per cent, stated the latest data.
Further, the delay in southwest monsoons has worsened the drought index, the DEWS reported.
In the June 6 update, real-time platform recorded 43.02 per cent area under ‘abnormally to exceptionally dry’ conditions. However, the latest data showed an increase (44.17 per cent). 
Similarly, percentage of area under ‘extremely dry to exceptional dry’ increased from 10.83 to 11.22 per cent during the same period.
India has witnessed the second-driest pre-monsoon season in the last 65 years. The country received 99 millimeters (mm) rainfall between March and May — with 23 per cent below the normal rainfall during this time of the year —, showed the latest data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD).
The deficit is prevalent across the country with south India having a deficit of 47 per cent, followed by northwest India (30 per cent), central India (18 per cent), and east and northeast (14 per cent).
The month of June, which accounts for 18 per cent of rain, may end up with a deficit of 40 per cent in at least 66 districts across the country, warned Skymet Weather, a private weather forecasting agency.
The low rainfall would be difficult to make up for the deficit in coming months, it noted.
According to the IMD, there is also a possibility of weaker monsoon in July. It could be a great cause of worry, as the month is crucial and receives one third of the total monsoon rains in the country. 
The sluggish pace of the south west monsoon has compounded the severe dry spell. As a result, at least 30 sub-divisions are likely to experience ‘deficient’ and ‘largely deficient’ monsoon season, the IMD said.
Most of these are in Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, and the north eastern states. Only four sub-divisions in Karnataka, Gujarat, and Lakshadweep have witnessed ‘normal’ rainfall.
Low rainfall has also contributed to a downward trend in water levels in at least 71 of 91 reservoirs across India, a recent bulletin by the Central Water Commission (CWC), has showed.
The situation is particularly grim in the north-western region — in Gujarat and Maharashtra — and in the southern states of Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu, it said."

Affected people will also receive household items and kitchen sets such as bed sheets, torches, cooking pots and kitchen utensils."
drought,"A severe drought is threatening South Africa's wildlife industry, with game farmers keeping fewer animals and tourists visiting game lodges in smaller numbers.
Parts of the country have been affected by consecutive years of abnormally hot weather and below average rainfall that have scorched grazing lands and dried up watering holes since 2015, the driest year on record.
Industry body Wildlife Ranching South Africa (WRSA) estimates the Northern Cape province has lost more than two-thirds of its game over the last three years.
It is conducting a countrywide survey to determine the scale of animal losses and the financial impact on the country's more than 9,000 wildlife ranches.
“It's been an extraordinary drought,” said WRSA chief Adri Kitshoff-Botha. “It's not a one-year or two-year drought. In some areas we've seen it has been going now for six years.”
The wildlife industry generates revenue for South Africa through tourism, hunting, breeding and meat production.
Trophy hunting alone generated 2bn rand (£106m) in 2016, according to research carried out for the environment ministry.
Southern Africa's temperatures are rising at twice the global average rate, according to the International Panel on Climate Change, and in much of South Africa the level of water in reservoirs is dwindling.
For Burger Schoeman, manager at Northern Cape game farm Thuru Lodge, the withered vegetation and parched ground are a serious concern for the sector.
Once home to around 4,500 wild animals _ including 35 different species, from antelope to rhino _ the lodge has lost around 1,000 animals due to drought. Carcasses are piling up in abandoned mines on the edge of the property.
“At this stage we are quite stretched. All the money you get from selling the animals, meat and all of that, gets put straight back into the property to look after the rest of the animals,” Mr Schoeman said."
drought,"On the Western Slope, a truly cataclysmic summer is emerging. The next few months look to be the driest in anyone’s memory.
At the headwaters of the Colorado River, water scarcity is now creating dire consequences for ranchers and their surrounding rural communities. Poor snowpack and sporadic rain have turned once lush pastures into meadows of weeds and dust. Livestock and native grazers are competing with wild horses for shrinking water sources. Catastrophic wildfires are threatening to change entire watersheds, reducing grazing capacity and even shutting down some farmers permanently.
Federal forest lands, a critical source of the west’s water supply, are in poor and unnatural condition. Forest health has a direct connection to watershed health and the water supply that millions depend upon. The reduction in upper watershed flows is directly correlated to the health of the forests.
Without new ways to capture altered streamflow patterns, we will be left with collapsing systems that will impact food production, migratory birds, fish and ecosystem biodiversity.
Across the country, extreme weather events are only getting worse, totaling billions of dollars in damages each year. It is clear that we need solutions that will address the very real and present threat of climate change. With dry years increasingly the norm in Colorado and much of the West, the infrastructure package currently being debated in Washington, D.C., takes on an added sense of urgency and must include significant federal investments in Western water infrastructure.
Persistent drought conditions place at risk our thriving population centers, deep ecological heritage, and world-class farms and ranches.
Eleven national forests and four national parks are a source of state pride and provide millions of acres for environmental benefit and year-round outdoor recreation. Warmer, drier conditions will increase the frequency and severity of wildfires and make our forests more susceptible to pests such as the mountain pine beetle."
valcano eruption,"Death toll from Congo volcano eruption rises to at least 32 KINSHASA, Congo (AP) — The volcanic eruption in eastern Congo two days ago has killed at least 32 people, officials said Monday as residents searched for missing loved ones amid destroyed homes on the outskirts of the eastern city of Goma where aftershocks were detected. With little warning Mount Nyiragongo turned the dark sky fiery red Saturday night and then spewed torrents of lava into villages destroying more than 500 homes, officials and survivors said. The toll Monday increased from 22 to 32, and was likely to continue rising, saidccording to Joseph Makundi, head of Civil Protection for the North Kivu province. More than a dozen people died in car accidents while trying to escape, he said. Others were killed when lava hit their homes."
wildfires,"Australia is reeling under a forest fire which has already burned more than 2.5 million acres of the country’s east coast, and wreaked havoc to the wildlife.
Fire conditions classified as ""severe"" or higher have affected normal life, with some states facing a ‘catastrophic’ level of danger.
Amidst such a deadly environment, mankind is trying its best to save lives around them. A few days back, a defenceless koala bear caught in the fire was rescued by a woman, who took her shirt off and shielded the animal.
Like her, many local people came forward to save the large number of marsupials from the devastating fire. In order to ensure that all these rescued koalas get a homely atmosphere, residents made little mittens and pouches for the animals.
Unilad reported that hospitals were filled with injured or dehydrated animals and with this influx, there is a struggle to keep up with the demand for supplies. The residents stepped into the situation and did their best to save the little beings.
The Rescue Collective, a non-profit group, helping rescuers and hospitals with the supplies that they are collecting from the public, the report stated.
Speaking to ABC radio, Nicole Blums, an organiser to the operation said, locals have flooded in with necessary supplies like mittens and pouches.
“We have had people knitting koala mittens for burnt pads and sewing pouches for marsupials. People are so passionate to help the animals, they want to save our national emblems and they want to do whatever they can to help,” Blums said.
""More than $75,000 has gone out to koala hospitals in the state so far,"" Blums added.
He further revealed that more than 1,000 people have pooled in to help where they can.
Earlier this week, a heartbreaking video surfaced where a badly burnt koala named Kate was being fed water by a man in Bellangry State Forrest.
The animal had received severe burns in the bushfires and arrived at the Port Macquarie Koala Hospital completely dehydrated"
earthquake,"Tsunami advisory issued after earthquake strikes off Japan's coast TOKYO — An earthquake struck off Japan's northeast coast Saturday, shaking buildings even in Tokyo and triggering a tsunami advisory for a part of the northern coast. The Meteorological Agency of Japan said in a statement that the quake struck at 6:09 p.m. local time (6:09 a.m. ET) near the Miyagi Prefecture, which was heavily damaged during the huge earthquake and tsunami of 2011, that killed thousands and made global headlines. No major damage has been reported, according to Japan's public broadcaster NHK, and there have been no reports of severe injuries. The earthquake was initially recorded as having a magnitude of 7.2 , which was downgraded later on Saturday to 6.9 by the Japan Meteorological Agency, which also re-adjusted its calculations of the depth of the epicenter to 59 km from 60 km. An initial advisory for a tsunami up to 1 meter in height for Miyagi prefecture immediately after the quake, was also lifted by Japan's Meteorological Agency later on Saturday. The U.S. Pacific Tsunami Warning Center rescinded a similar tsunami advisory notice that had been issued. ""Based on all available data, the tsunami threat from this earthquake has now passed,"" it said in a statement."
other,"The economy is continuing to make progress toward the Federal Reserve's objectives of maximum employment and price stability.In the labor market, gains in total nonfarm payroll employment averaged about 230,000 per month over the first half of this year, a somewhat stronger pace than in 2013 and enough to bring the total increase in jobs during the economic recovery thus far to more than 9 million. The unemployment rate has fallen nearly 1-1/2 percentage points over the past year and stood at 6.1 percent in June, down about 4 percentage points from its peak. Broader measures of labor utilization have also registered notable improvements over the past year.Real gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have declined sharply in the first quarter. The decline appears to have resulted mostly from transitory factors, and a number of recent indicators of production and spending suggest that growth rebounded in the second quarter, but this bears close watching. The housing sector, however, has shown little recent progress. While this sector has recovered notably from its earlier trough, housing activity leveled off in the wake of last year's increase in mortgage rates, and readings this year have, overall, continued to be disappointing.Although the economy continues to improve, the recovery is not yet complete. Even with the recent declines, the unemployment rate remains above Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants' estimates of its longer-run normal level. Labor force participation appears weaker than one would expect based on the aging of the population and the level of unemployment. These and other indications that significant slack remains in labor markets are corroborated by the continued slow pace of growth in most measures of hourly compensation.Inflation has moved up in recent months but remains below the FOMC's 2 percent objective for inflation over the longer run. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased 1.8 percent over the 12 months through May. Pressures on food and energy prices account for some of the increase in PCE price inflation. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 1.5 percent. Most Committee participants project that both total and core inflation will be between 1-1/2 and 1-3/4 percent for this year as a whole.Although the decline in GDP in the first quarter led to some downgrading of our growth projections for this year, I and other FOMC participants continue to anticipate that economic activity will expand at a moderate pace over the next several years, supported by accommodative monetary policy, a waning drag from fiscal policy, the lagged effects of higher home prices and equity values, and strengthening foreign growth. The Committee sees the projected pace of economic growth as sufficient to support ongoing improvement in the labor market with further job gains, and the unemployment rate is anticipated to continue to decline toward its longer-run sustainable level. Consistent with the anticipated further recovery in the labor market, and given that longer-term inflation expectations appear to be well anchored, we expect inflation to move back toward our 2 percent objective over coming years.As always, considerable uncertainty surrounds our projections for economic growth, unemployment, and inflation. FOMC participants currently judge these risks to be nearly balanced but to warrant monitoring in the months ahead."
wildfires,"Impossibly fast and ferocious blazes burned a staggering 4.1m acres, making for an‘astonishing and horrifying’ year
On a deadly 24-hour march through the Sierra Nevada in September, the flames of what would become the North Complex fire raced through more than 200,000 acres of dense timber, destroyed a historic schoolhouse and overtook a beloved camp for children with cancer.
Also in its path was the remote settlement of Berry Creek, where Daniel Salazar, 27, found himself once again facing an unprecedented, out of control blaze. Less than two years earlier, Salazar had escaped the Camp fire, which killed his grandparents and 83 others in and around the town of Paradise.
In the Sierra Nevada and across California in late summer and early fall this year, firefighters and residents fought a losing battle against impossibly fast and ferocious blazes.
It was the state’s worst wildfire season on record. By the end of it, the flames had killed 31 people, destroyed or damaged more than 10,000 buildings and burned a staggering 4.1m acres. The North Complex fire was responsible for more than 300,000 acres of scorched land, killing 16 people in its wake."
drought,"Some parts of the Horn of Africa have been hit by the worst drought in 60 years, the UN says.
More than 10 million people are thought to be affected across the region.
The UN now classifies large areas of Somalia, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Kenya as a crisis or an emergency.
Charity Save the Children says drought and war in Somalia has led to unprecedented numbers fleeing across the border into Kenya, with about 1,300 people arriving every day.
Three camps at Dadaab, just inside Kenya, are home to well over 350,000 people, but they were built to hold just 90,000 and are severely overcrowded.
A prolonged failure of rains, which began in late 2010, is now taking its toll.
The UN's Office for the Co-Ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) warns that the situation is continuing to deteriorate, and the number of people in need will continue to increase.
The numbers now affected are huge, Ohca says: 3.2m in Ethiopia, 3.2m in Kenya, 2.6m in Somalia and more than 100,000 in Djibouti.
Every month during 2011, about 15,000 Somalis have fled their country, arriving in Kenya and Ethiopia, according to Ocha.
While conflict has been a fact of life for them for years, it is the drought that has brought them to breaking point. Many have walked for days, are exhausted, in poor health, desperate for food and water.
The UN refugee agency is dealing with the exodus.
A new refugee camp primarily for Somalis was opened at Kobe in Ethiopia last Friday, near an existing camp at Melkadida.
More than 3,500 refugees and their belongings were moved there over the weekend.
The UNHCR says this is the sixth camp for Somalis in Ethiopia, which is currently housing some 130,000 displaced people.
Food prices have risen substantially across the region, pushing many moderately poor households over the edge.
The price of grain in affected areas in Kenya is 30-80% above average.
The spokeswoman for Ocha, Elizabeth Byrs, said appeals for Somalia and Kenya, each about 525m (328m), are barely 50% funded, while a 30m appeal for Djibouti has raised just 30% of the needed funds."
Typhoon,"Powerful Hurricane Iota made landfall on Nicaragua’s Caribbean coast late Monday, threatening catastrophic damage to the same part of Central America already battered by equally strong Hurricane Eta less than two weeks ago.
Iota had intensified into an extremely dangerous Category 5 storm early in the day, but the U.S. National Hurricane Center said it weakened slightly to Category 4, with maximum sustained winds of 155 mph (250 kph). Its center made landfall about 30 miles (45 kilometers) south of the Nicaraguan city of Puerto Cabezas, also known as Bilwi.
Iota already had been hitting the Caribbean coasts of Nicaragua and Honduras with torrential rains and strong winds.
Iota came ashore just 15 miles (25 kilometers) south of where Hurricane Eta made landfall Nov. 3, also as a Category 4 storm. Eta’s torrential rains saturated the soil in the region, leaving it prone to new landslides and floods, and that the storm surge could reach 15 to 20 feet (4.5 to 6 meters) above normal tides.
In Bilwi, business owner Adán Artola Schultz braced himself in the doorway of his house as strong gusts of wind and rain drover water in torrents down the street. He watched in amazement as wind ripped away the metal roof structure from a substantial two-story home and blew it away like paper.
“It is like bullets,” he said of the sound of metal structures banging and buckling in the wind. “This is double destruction,” he said, referring to the damages wrought by Eta just 12 days earlier.
“This is coming in with fury,” said Artola Schultz.
Storm surge was on the mind of Yasmina Wriedt in Bilwi’s seaside El Muelle neighborhood.
“The situation doesn’t look good at all,” Wriedt said earlier in the day. “We woke up without electricity, with rain and the surf is getting really high.”"
wildfires,"Wildfires continue to cause problems in the Dakotas, from shutting down a stretch of interstate to destroying a fire truck.
Smoke from a grassland fire in south central South Dakota shut down a 15-mile stretch of Interstate 90 Wednesday night. Several other fires burned across the state Thursday, including one near Wessington in the east that scorched about 320 acres and prompted the evacuation of one home. In the west, fire crews did mop-up work on a blaze that threatened several homes west of Rapid City earlier in the week.
In western North Dakota, the Killdeer Fire Department lost a pumper truck when its engine failed while crews were fighting a blaze that prompted the evacuation of one home. A fire on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation burned more than 1,000 acres, or about 1  square miles."
flood,"Flood death toll in Cambodia, Vietnam nears 40 as tropical storm Nangka heads for Viet coast HANOI/PHNOM PENH (REUTERS, BLOOMBERG) - Nearly 40 people have died in Vietnam and Cambodia and scores more were missing, including rescuers, due to prolonged heavy rain and flash flooding as tropical storm Nangka edged towards the Vietnamese coast on Tuesday (Oct 13).  Heavy rain since early October have caused deadly floods and landslides in several provinces in central Vietnam and displaced thousands of people in western Cambodia, officials and state media said.  The floods are expected to worsen over the coming days, with tropical storm Nangka forecast to dump more rain as it makes landfall in Vietnam on Wednesday.  Nangka, packing wind speeds of up to 100kmh will trigger heavy rain of up to 400mm in parts of northern and central Vietnam from Wednesday through Friday, its weather agency said.  Ongoing flooding has killed at least 28 people in Vietnam, and 11 in Cambodia, where almost 25,000 houses and 84,000ha of crops have been damaged, according to local media.  Vietnamese disaster management authorities said over 130,000 houses have been impacted."
drought,"The wheat harvest on Marci Green’s farm doesn’t usually begin until late August, but a severe drought stunted this year’s crop and her crews finished harvesting last week because she didn’t want what had grown so far to shrivel and die in the heat.
It’s the same story across the wheat country of eastern Washington state, a vast expanse of seemingly endless stretches of flatlands with rolling hills along its edges that produces the nation’s fourth largest wheat crop. It’s been devastated by a drought the National Weather Service has classified as “exceptional” and the worst since 1977.
“This is definitely the worst crop year we have had since we started farming 35 years ago,” said Green, whose family is the sixth generation on the same farming land just south of the city of Spokane.
She estimated her farm’s wheat crop this year at half of normal, and of poor quality.
Green grows soft white winter wheat, a variety that is prized in Asian countries because it is excellent for making pastries, cakes, cookies and noodles.
At least Green will have some wheat to sell. Some Washington wheat farms produced almost none because of the drought.
“We’re seeing complete crop failure in some areas,” said Michelle Hennings, executive director of the Washington Association of Wheat Growers in the small community of Ritzville, in the heart of the state’s wheat growing region.
Only about 10 percent of Washington’s wheat crop comes from farms with irrigation. The rest of the farms rely on rain, which has been rare in what is shaping up as one of the hottest summers in the state’s history.
The current estimate for the crop is 117 million bushels, down from last year’s 165 million, and there is a good chance the crop will be smaller than 117 million, said Glen Squires, director of the Washington Grain Commission, which represents farmers. A bushel is about 60 pounds (27 kilograms).
Oregon and Idaho also produce soft white winter wheat, and their crops have also been hurt by drought, Squires said."
wildfires,"The Caldor Fire, which ignited Saturday evening in the Omo Ranch area, about 60 miles east of Sacramento, exploded Tuesday morning from 6,500 acres to 53,772 acres in less than 24 hours by Wednesday morning, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire.
The rapidly expanding wildfire has already seriously injured two people and prompted more mandatory evacuation orders Tuesday evening for thousands of residents and tourists in El Dorado County.
It remains zero percent contained.
Firefighters continue to face dynamic conditions on the ground. Smoke from the nearby Dixie Fire hampered air attack efforts while the shapeshifting nature of the Caldor Fire has made it difficult for officials to accurately map the incident, Cal Fire officials said during a community meeting Tuesday evening.
""We are here to see this until the end,"" said Cal Fire incident commander Dusty Martin.
Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for El Dorado County earlier Tuesday, mobilizing the California National Guard and freeing up additional resources for impacted communities.
Two people were airlifted with serious injuries and very few homes were left standing in Grizzly Flats, a town of about 1,200 residents, where streets were littered with downed power lines and poles. Houses were reduced to smoldering ash and twisted metal with only chimneys rising above the ruins. A post office and elementary school were also destroyed.
Residents in Pollock Pines, Sly Park, Happy Valley and the Grizzly Flats and Somerset areas were all issued mandatory evacuation orders while campers were rushed out of the Sly Park Recreation Area. Dark heavy smoke blanketed much of the region, including in nearby Lake Tahoe and other population destinations, prompting bumper-to-bumper traffic along evacuation routes.
Nearly 17,000 people across California are under evacuation orders, according to the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services, or Cal OES.
Scott Stephens, a professor of wildfire science at the University of California-Berkeley, previously told NBC News that the explosion of wildfires in the past decade has been fueled by the culmination of drought conditions, hotter temperatures and flammable forest debris, like downed trees."
other,"In the case of protein-rich items such as eggs, price pressures were visible during June-July 2018, reflecting the combined impact of the usual lower egg production during summer months and higher consumption during early monsoon months in several parts of the country. Furthermore, the country-wide truckers¡¯ strike in July also affected the supply of eggs in several states, adding to upside pressures on prices. However, prices of eggs softened in August. Among other protein-rich items, meat and fish prices experienced the usual upside pressures during May-June, followed by easing during July-August. In the case of milk and products, price pressures were subdued due to robust growth in milk production.Among other food components, edible oil inflation recorded a pick-up in August 2018 after remaining in the range of one to three per cent since May 2017.After an increase in import duties on all major varieties of oils in November 2017, duties were hiked further during March and June 2018 in order to curb cheap imports. Inflation in spices started rising beginning April 2018 after remaining in deflation for 10 successive months since June 2017. While pressures on black pepper prices have remained muted so far, prices of other spices like dry chillies, turmeric, jeera, dhania and tamarind have firmed up, thereby driving up overall inflation in this group (Charts II.7 and II.8). On July 4, 2018 the central government announced minimum support prices (MSPs) for all kharif crops of a minimum of 150 per cent of the cost of production. Increases in MSPs generally get transmitted to headline inflation through direct and second round effects and, it is in the context of the upside risks to the near-term inflation outlook that the size and span of the impact of the MSP need to be carefully evaluated (Box II.1).Fuel and light inflation increased sequentially every month from a trough of 5.2 per cent in April 2018 to 7.2 per cent by June 2018 and further to 8.5 per cent by August 2018 (Chart II.12a). Domestic prices of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) tracked rising international product prices. Since the migration of subsidy payments on LPG to bank accounts under the direct benefit transfer scheme, LPG prices in CPI mirror open market prices. As such, they now reflect international prices closely (Chart II.12b). Inflation in respect of items of rural consumption such as firewood and chips continued to be sticky and elevated. Administered kerosene prices also registered sustained increases as oil marketing companies (OMCs) raised prices regularly in a calibrated manner."
valcano eruption,"Guatemala: 110 Killed in Volcano Eruption, Search for Missing Ends Guatemala has ended its search for the nearly 200 people missing since a volcano erupted earlier this month. Officials have confirmed the deaths of 110 people in the eruption of the Fuego volcano. The country's disaster agency CONRED said Sunday it has called off searches in San Miguel Los Lotes and El Rodeo because the area is ""uninhabitable and high risk."" The volcano continues to generate four or five weak explosions an hour, sending a column of ash more than 1,000 meters into the air. Disaster officials said the eruption Sunday affected more than 1 million people, with 3,265 evacuated from areas around the volcano. Meanwhile, Guatemalan authorities have opened an investigation into whether emergency protocols were followed properly. Opposition politicians are accusing CONRED of being slow to order evacuations, leaving villagers vulnerable."
drought,"evere to extreme drought is expected to hit countries in the lower Mekong basin from now until January 2020, warns the Mekong River Commission. Thailand and Cambodia would be hardest hit compared to Lao PDR and Viet Nam.    
Preliminary analysis of MRC’s data has shown that the draught is caused by insufficient rainfall during the wet season with a delayed arrival and earlier departure of the monsoon rain and an El Nino event that has created an abnormally high temperature and high evapotranspiration. 
During a normal year, the monsoon rain usually starts in late May and ends in October. But this year, it began almost two weeks late and departed about three weeks earlier. 
“This year’s prolonged dry weather condition can possibly adversely impact agricultural and crop production. The issue of water shortages for consumption could also come into play as the drought persists,” said Dr. Lam Hung Son, the MRC Secretariat’s Head of Regional Flood and Drought Management Center, who led the analysis.  
Using a three-month timeframe, the analysis looked at both the probability and degree of drought and rainfall occurrences compared with historical data called the standardized precipitation index (SPI), and the degree of dryness of the top soil layer known as the combined drought index (CDI) in the four MRC Member States: Lao PDR, Cambodia, Thailand and VietNam."
wildfires,"Below is an update on the fire, from the incident management team Tuesday night:
“Firefighters made excellent progress today by strengthening fire lines and establishing five percent containment on the 16,553 acre fire. The Washington Fire, 8 miles south of Markleeville, CA, experienced lighter winds and burning conditions more conducive to aggressive ground and air suppression actions.
“Several campgrounds along Highway 4 to the north end of Markleeville remain evacuated. For the safety of the public and active fire suppression activities, Highways 4 and 89 in the Monitor Pass area remain closed, as do the Turtle Rock and Indian Creek campgrounds. Markleeville residents remain under an evacuation advisory issued by Alpine County Sherriff’s office. No mandatory evacuations are in effect at this time.
“Twelve helicopters and 8 air tankers support the suppression effort on the fires, dropping retardant, ferrying equipment and supplies, transporting firefighters, and providing essential surveillance of areas far inside the perimeter not safely accessible by foot. Other key resources include 19 engines, 10 water tenders, and 19 crews. There are approximately 681 personnel assigned to the fire.
“Firefighters made significant progress around the entire fire perimeter, with their priority being the line along the north of State Highway 89. The primary tactical priority is to prevent the fire from reaching Markleeville. The next priorities are to buttress the lines along Wolf Creek and the Leviathan Mine reclamation site.”"
drought,"At the end of April 2021, drought conditions were covering 85 percent of Mexico. Numerous lakes and reservoirs have dried up, or are in the process of drying up, including the country's second-largest body of freshwater -- Lake Cuitzeo.
Before the current drought, Lake Cuitzeo was Mexico's second-biggest lake, with an area of approximately 300 - 400 km2 (120 - 150 mi2), and the site of a thriving fishing economy in Michoacán.
Now, this is a cemetery of abandoned fishing boats and a shortcut for motorists which creates frequent and prolonged dust clouds that reach municipalities 20 km (12.4 miles) away in Guanajuato.
That affects the health of residents in nearby communities, causing allergies, respiratory illnesses, and gastrointestinal complications from the bacteria they transport, according to the State Health Ministry.
The images below show Lake Cuitzeo on May 4, 2020, and May 4, 2021. The difference is staggering.
According to Julieta Gallardo Mora, honorary president of a foundation committed to conserving the lake, its deterioration started in 1941, and authorities have made no effort to stop it.
""The first blow was when the Cointzio dam was built in 1941, which meant that two-thirds of Lake Cuitzeo was removed,"" she said.
The first noticeable impact was the disappearance of fish, starting with the choristoma, which is native to the lakes of Jalisco and Michoacán, followed by whitefish and other water life."
other,"The Singapore economy is evolving as envisaged in the January MPS.  GDP is on track to grow at 2_4% in 2015, and there is no change to the forecasts for CPI-All Items inflation and MAS Core Inflation.  External price pressures should be contained, while domestic cost pass-through to consumer prices is expected to be moderate this year.  Beyond the near term, underlying cost and price pressures could pick up, given the continued tightness in the labour market.  MAS will therefore maintain the policy of a modest and gradual appreciation of the S$NEER policy band.  There will be no change to the slope and width of the policy band, and the level at which it is centred.  This policy stance is consistent with the benign inflation outlook and moderate growth prospects for the whole of 2015, and appropriate for ensuring medium-term price stability in the economy."
earthquake,"Magnitude-6.9 earthquake strikes Papua New Guinea Tsunami alert issued following tremor An magnitude-6.9 earthquake hit near Lae, Papua New Guinea, and a tsunami alert was issued Friday, according to Radio New Zealand. The epicenter was located in Wau village near Lae, and the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued a tidal wave warning for Papua New Guinea shores. The US Geological Research Center said the quake occurred 85 kilometers (52 miles) below the surface. Officials are yet to make a statement on casualties and property damage."
other,"Although the federal funds rate is likely to remain exceptionally low for an extended period, as the expansion matures, the Federal Reserve will at some point need to begin to tighten monetary conditions to prevent the development of inflationary pressures. Notwithstanding the substantial increase in the size of its balance sheet associated with its purchases of Treasury and agency securities, we are confident that we have the tools we need to firm the stance of monetary policy at the appropriate time.Most importantly, in October 2008 the Congress gave statutory authority to the Federal Reserve to pay interest on banks' holdings of reserve balances at Federal Reserve Banks. By increasing the interest rate on reserves, the Federal Reserve will be able to put significant upward pressure on all short-term interest rates. Actual and prospective increases in short-term interest rates will be reflected in turn in longer-term interest rates and in financial conditions more generally.The Federal Reserve has also been developing a number of additional tools to reduce the large quantity of reserves held by the banking system, which will improve the Federal Reserve's control of financial conditions by leading to a tighter relationship between the interest rate paid on reserves and other short-term interest rates. Notably, our operational capacity for conducting reverse repurchase agreements, a tool that the Federal Reserve has historically used to absorb reserves from the banking system, is being expanded so that such transactions can be used to absorb large quantities of reserves.3 The Federal Reserve is also currently refining plans for a term deposit facility that could convert a portion of depository institutions' holdings of reserve balances into deposits that are less liquid and could not be used to meet reserve requirements.4 In addition, the FOMC has the option of redeeming or selling securities as a means of reducing outstanding bank reserves and applying monetary restraint. Of course, the sequencing of steps and the combination of tools that the Federal Reserve uses as it exits from its currently very accommodative policy stance will depend on economic and financial developments. I provided more discussion of these options and possible sequencing in a recent testimony."
Typhoon,"Typhoon ""Yolanda"" (international name Haiyan) has made landfall in Eastern Visayas, threatening areas in its path, state weather bureau PAGASA said.
PAGASA said Yolanda made landfall over Guiuan, Eastern Samar at 4:40 a.m. It made a second landfall over Tolosa, Leyte at 7 a.m.
Yolanda was packing maximum sustained winds of 235 kilometers per hour near the center and gusts of up to 275 kph.
In Tacloban City, Leyte, a city very near the site where the typhoon first made landfall, flood water quickly rose. Video footage showed debris on the road being swept by flood waters.
Visibility was also poor due to the sheer strength of the typhoon's wind.
More areas have been placed under public storm warning signal no. 4, where winds of at least 185 kph may be felt in at least 12 hours.
PAGASA said areas under signal no. 4 are Masbate, Ticao Island, Southern Sorsogon, Romblon, Northern Samar, Eastern Samar, Samar, Leyte, Southern Leyte , Biliran , Northern Cebu, Cebu City, Bantayan, Camotes Island, Northern Negros Occidental, Capiz, Aklan, Antique, Iloilo, and Guimaras.
Under signal no. 3 are Burias Island, Albay, Marinduque, Occidental Mindoro, Oriental Mindoro, Calamian Group of Islands, the rest of Sorsogon, the rest of Negros Occidental, Negros Oriental, the rest of Cebu, Bohol, Surigao del Norte, and Siargao Island.
Catanduanes, Camarines Sur, Southern Quezon, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, Metro Manila, Cavite, Bataan, Lubang Island, Siquijor , Northern Palawan , Puerto Princesa, Camiguin, Surigao Del Sur, and Agusan Del Norte have been placed under signal no. 2.
Meanwhile, under signal no. 1 are Camarines Norte, rest of Quezon , Polilio Island, Bulacan, Pampanga, Zambales, Misamis Oriental, and Agusan del Sur.
 
Forecast track of Typhoon ""Yolanda"" as of 2 a.m., 08 November 2013. Image from PAGASA
PAGASA said Yolanda is forecast to move west northwest at 39 kph. After hitting Guiuan, it is expected to traverse the provinces of Biliran, the northern tip of Cebu, Iloilo, Capiz, Aklan, Romblon, Semirara Island, southern part of Mindoro and then Busuanga.
Yolanda is expected to exit Philippine landmass on Saturday morning, moving towards the West Philippine Sea.
An estimated rainfall amount of 10 to 30 millimeters per hour (heavy - intense) is expected within the typhoon's 400-km diameter.
Sea travel is risky over the seaboards of Northern Luzon and the eastern seaboard of Central Luzon.
Residents in low lying and mountainous areas under signal nos. 4, 3 and 2 are alerted against possible flash floods and landslides. Likewise, those living in coastal areas under signal nos. 4, 3 and 2 are alerted against storm surges which may produce waves with height of at least 7 meters.
Storm surge warning
The Department of Science and Technology's Project NOAH (Nationwide Operational Assessment of Hazards) said areas in the path of the typhoon could experience tidal and storm-induced waves that could reach as high as 17 feet.
Project NOAH said Ormoc, Leyte could experience waves as high as 5.2 meters (17 feet), with its peak occurring at 2 p.m. today.
Other areas that will see seawater rise above more than 4 meters (13 feet) because of typhoon Yolanda include Matarinao Bay, Eastern Samar (4.7 meters); Port Pusgo, Quezon (4.6 meters); Santa Cruz Harbor, Quezon (4.3 meters); Poro Island, Biliran (4.3 meters); Banate, Iloilo (4.1 meters); and Port Barton, Palawan (4 meters).
An estimated 17 million people are forecast to be affected by cyclone-strength winds brought by the typhoon.
The Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System (GDACS), a cooperation framework between the United Nations, the European Commission and disaster managers worldwide to improve alerts, said 14.2 million people may be affected by Category 1 (120 kilometers per hour) wind speeds.
In an advisory issued at 5 a.m. on Friday (Manila time), GDACS said Yolanda was already packing 315 kph maximum sustained winds.
Massive evacuation
President Benigno Aquino had on Thursday warned his countrymen to make all possible preparations for Haiyan, which was packing monster wind gusts of nearly 380 kilometers (235 miles) an hour as it approached the Philippines.
""To our local officials, your constituents are facing a serious peril. Let us do all we can while (Haiyan) has not yet hit land,"" Aquino said in a nationally televised address.
""We can minimize the effects of this typhoon if we help each other. Let us remain calm, especially in buying our primary needs, and in moving to safer places.""
Aquino warned areas within the expected 600-kilometer typhoon front would be exposed to severe flooding as well as devastating winds, while coastal areas may see waves six meters (20 feet) high.
More than 125,000 people in the most vulnerable areas had been moved to evacuation centers before Haiyan hit, according to the civil defense office, and millions of others braced for the typhoon in their homes.
Authorities said schools in the storm's path were closed, ferry services suspended and fishermen ordered to secure their vessels.
In the capital of Manila, which was not directly in the typhoon's path but still expected to feel some of its impact, many schools were also closed.
Philippine Airlines, Cebu Pacific and other carriers announced the suspension of hundreds of flights, mostly domestic but also some international.
Cajulis said Haiyan was travelling quickly, at 39 kilometers an hour, and would travel across the country towards the South China Sea throughout Friday.
There were no immediate reports of casualties.
State weather forecaster Glaize Escullar said on Thursday Haiyan was expected to hit areas still recovering from a devastating storm in 2011 and from a 7.1-magnitude quake last month.
They include the central island of Bohol, the epicenter of the earthquake that killed 222 people, where at least 5,000 survivors are still living in tents while waiting for new homes.
Other vulnerable areas are the port cities of Cagayan de Oro and Iligan on the southern island of Mindanao, where flash floods induced by Tropical Storm Washi killed more than 1,000 people in December 2011.
Haiyan had maximum sustained winds on Friday morning of 315 kilometers an hour, and gusts of 379 kilometers an hour, according to the US Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Center.
The Philippine state weather service, which typically gives lower wind readings, said the maximum gusts on Friday morning were 275 kilometers an hour.
But even that reading would still make Haiyan the world's strongest typhoon this year, according to David Michael Padua, a meteorologist with the Weather Philippines Foundation, a storm monitoring organisation that runs the www.weather.com.ph website.
""The wind speeds of this extremely catastrophic cyclone has increased further to 315 km/hr, making it the most powerful typhoon ever observed since Super Typhoon Tip of 1979,"" Padua said.
The Philippines is battered by an average of 20 major storms or typhoons each year, many of them deadly, but scientists have said climate change may be increasing their ferocity and frequency.
The Philippines endured the world's strongest storm of 2012, when Typhoon Bopha left about 2,000 people dead or missing on Mindanao island in December. _ with Agence France-Presse"
earthquake,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- One of the biggest earthquakes to hit the South Pacific in modern history forced thousands of people in New Zealand to evacuate and triggered tsunami warnings across the world Friday, but it did not appear to cause injuries or major damage because it struck in remote ocean.
The magnitude 8.1 quake was the largest in a series of tremors that hit the region over several hours, including two earlier quakes that registered magnitude 7.4 and magnitude 7.3.
The earthquakes triggered warning systems and caused traffic jams and some chaos in New Zealand as people scrambled to get to higher ground, but their remoteness meant they did not appear to pose a widespread threat to lives or infrastructure.
The largest quake struck about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) off the coast of New Zealand. One of the earlier quakes hit much closer to New Zealand and awoke many people as they felt a long, rumbling shaking.
“Hope everyone is ok out there,” New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern wrote on Facebook during the night.
After the largest quake, civil defense authorities in New Zealand told people in some coastal areas to immediately get to higher ground. They said a damaging tsunami was possible, and waves could reach up to 3 meters (10 feet).
Emergency Management Minister Kiri Allan told reporters that people had followed the advisory.
“They felt the long or strong earthquakes and they knew to grab their bag and head into the highlands,” she said. “I can only thank and acknowledge the tireless efforts of the men and women from up and down the coast who knew how to act, when to act, and what to do.”
She warned that the threat could remain throughout much of the afternoon and people should not return home until authorities gave the all-clear. Allan said evacuations took precedence over coronavirus distancing measures.
The U.S. Tsunami Warning System also cautioned the quake could cause tsunami waves of up to 3 meters (10 feet) in Vanuatu and up to 1 meter (3 feet) in Australia, Fiji, French Polynesia and as far away as Mexico and Peru.
The U.S. Geological Survey said it was centered near the remote Kermadec Islands at a depth of 19 kilometers (12 miles).
The agency said in a report that the quake occurred at the intersection of the Pacific and Australia tectonic plates and eclipsed the largest quake previously recorded in the region, a magnitude 8.0 in 1976.
It said the interaction between the plates creates one of the most seismically active regions in the world, and it has recorded 215 quakes there above magnitude 6.0 over the past century.
Jennifer Eccles, an earthquake expert at the University of Auckland, said the quake was at the top end of the scale for those involving only the Earth's ocean crust.
“This is about as big as it gets,” she said.
She said most quakes larger than magnitude 8.0 tend to occur when a section of more robust continental crust is involved.
The U.S. Geological Survey said the magnitude 7.4 quake was likely a “foreshock” that contributed to the larger quake but that the first quake that hit closer to New Zealand was too far away in time and distance to have directly contributed.
Officials in New Zealand had hours earlier issued a tsunami warning for coastal areas after the first quake struck off its northeastern coast at about 2:30 a.m. Friday. There were no immediate reports of serious damage or casualties, and the warning was lifted just before the largest quake hit.
The U.S. Geological Survey said the first quake was centered at a depth of 21 kilometers (13 miles) under the ocean about 174 kilometers (108 miles) northeast of the city of Gisborne.
It was widely felt in New Zealand, and residents in the major cities of Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch reported being shaken awake.
In 2011, a magnitude 6.3 quake hit the city of Christchurch, killing 185 people and destroying much of its downtown."
earthquake,"Nine dead after earthquake hits Turkey-Iran border A 5.7 magnitude quake has struck Iran's northwestern border with Turkey. Ankara says nine people have been killed in Turkey, while Iran is still assessing damage and casualties. Nine people, including three children, have died following a 5.7 magnitude earthquake that struck the Turkey-Iran border region early on Sunday, Turkey's interior minister Suleyman Soylu said. Twenty-one people were injured — including eight who were in a critical condition, according to the health ministry. ""Search and rescue efforts are ongoing,"" Soylu said, adding that officials think people are still buried under the collapse of more than 1,000 buildings in several border villages. The quake had a depth of 5 kilometers (3.1 miles), the European Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) said."
other,"A major upside risk to the baseline inflation path in the April resolution has materialised, viz., 12 per cent increase in the price of Indian crude basket, which was sharper, earlier than expected and seems to be durable. Crude oil prices have been volatile recently and this imparts considerable uncertainty to the inflation outlook _ both on the upside and the downside. Several other risks remain. First, global financial market developments have emerged as another important source of uncertainty. Second, the significant rise in households¡¯ inflation expectations as gathered in the May 2018 round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s survey could feed into wages and input costs in the coming months. However, the pass-through to output prices remains muted presently. Third, the staggered impact of HRA revisions by various state governments may push headline inflation up. While the statistical impact of HRA revisions will be looked through, there is a need to watch out for any second round impact on inflation. Fourth, the impact of the revision in the MSP formula for kharif crops is not possible to assess at this stage in the absence of adequate details. Fifth, as forecast by the IMD, if the monsoon is normal and well-distributed temporally and spatially, it may help keep food inflation benign.Against the above backdrop, the MPC decided to increase the policy repo rate by 25 basis points and keep the stance neutral. The MPC reiterates its commitment to achieving the medium-term target for headline inflation of 4 per cent on a durable basis.The MPC notes that domestic economic activity has exhibited sustained revival in recent quarters and the output gap has almost closed. Investment activity, in particular, is recovering well and could receive a further boost from swift resolution of distressed sectors of the economy under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. Geo-political risks, global financial market volatility and the threat of trade protectionism pose headwinds to the domestic recovery. It is important that public finances do not crowd out private sector investment activity at this crucial juncture. Adherence to budgetary targets by the Centre and the States _ which appears to be the case thus far _ will also ease upside risks to the inflation outlook considerably."

Chester Magistrates Court verbally confirmed the news to CNN and said Mendy will remain in custody until the next trial date on September 10.
Mendy, 27, spoke in the court to confirm his name, address and date of birth.
On Thursday, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said the alleged events took place in Cheshire, northwest England, between October 2020 and August 2021 and related to three complainants over the age of 16.
""Mendy, of Withinlee Road, Prestbury, has been remanded in police custody and will appear before Chester Magistrates' Court on Friday 27 August 2021,"" the CPS statement read.
In a statement on the club's website, Manchester City said Mendy ""has been suspended pending an investigation.”
""The matter is subject to a legal process and the Club is therefore unable to make further comment until that process is complete,"" the statement read.
CNN reached out to Mendy's representatives but has yet to receive a response."
other,"The global economy entered 2017 with more momentum than earlier expected. Along with various survey indicators pointing to improved sentiment, growth in global industrial production and merchandise trade have picked up. Partly reflecting the run of recent data, the outlook for GDP growth in Australia's major trading partners has improved. GDP growth in China has been stronger than earlier anticipated, supported by accommodative macroeconomic policies, although growth is still expected to slow over coming years and the credit-based financing of some of the expansion poses risks. The largely policy-induced rebound in residential investment in China has spurred stronger demand for construction-related materials, such as steel, which in turn has boosted demand for iron ore and coal. High and rising debt, combined with excess capacity in some sectors, remains a risk to the medium-term outlook for growth in China. Growth in the major advanced economies is expected to be above potential, although there is significant uncertainty around policy in the United States and its effect on global growth and prices.Global inflationary pressures are somewhat stronger than they have been for some time, because of accommodative policy settings, the recent increases in commodity prices and limited spare capacity in a number of advanced economies. Reflecting this, sovereign bond yields have risen (though only back to levels of a year ago), the Federal Open Market Committee raised the federal funds rate, and there is no longer an expectation of further monetary easing in the other major advanced economies. The adjustments in global financial market prices have been orderly and measures of market volatility remain low."
wildfires,"A wildfire that forced the evacuation of 2,000 people just west of Madrid may have been started by several people working together, authorities said Tuesday.
Regional justice department chief Regina Planol told Cadena SER radio the fire affecting three towns was started in six points almost simultaneously, indicating it was arson. She compared it to ""environmental terrorism"" and urged residents to help police catch those responsible.
Alvaro Santamaria, the mayor of Valdemaqueda, one of the affected towns, said the fire came as close as 100 metres from the town's homes. He said firefighters were confident the blaze could be brought under control Tuesday.
No one was injured and those evacuated were expected to be able to return later in the day.
Spanish National Television said some 20 square kilometres of land have burned. Spain has seen 1,500 square kilometres of land hit by nearly 12,000 wildfires this year -- more than triple the amount burned last year.
Labour unions say Spanish government austerity cutbacks have led to a lack of resources to help firefighters battle blazes.
In southern Bosnia, military helicopters were sent in to help villagers and firefighters battling devastating wildfires in a region that has seen record high temperatures and no rain for over two months.
Pero Pavlovic, spokesman for the regional Civil Protection Agency, said the most critical situation Tuesday was around Glogosnica, where two blazes were creeping down inaccessible mountain slopes toward the village.
Wildfires were also burning near the Bosnian towns of Trebinje, Gacko, Nevesinje and Mostar."
valcano eruption,"Taal volcano's inner lake all but gone in eruption The Taal volcano in the Philippines continued erupting on Thursday, albeit with less of the ash production seen earlier in the week. Scientists are monitoring the situation remotely, using ground and space instrumentation, to try to gauge what might happen next. The radar image on this page is the latest to come down from the Iceye radar constellation. The Finnish system senses in the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, which gives it the ability to see through ejected ash and any cloud to detect directly the hard surface below. The data reveals how the inner lake (""Yellow Lake"") that once filled the very heart of the Taal volcano island has now almost completely disappeared. It was the interaction of this water with magma that drove a lot of the early explosive behaviour. The dashed line shows the extent of the lake before the onset of Sunday's eruption phase. The solid line traces the waterline at the time of Thursday's image acquisition (06:37 GMT)."
wildfires,"A wildfire in Florida has claimed the lives of two forest rangers, as emergency services continue to battle more than 400 blazes across the state.
The rangers had been trying contain a 12-acre (4.8-ha) blaze near the Georgia border, but the fire flared up and trapped them, officials said.
Two others were injured trying to save Josh Burch, 31, and Brett Fulton, 52.
The news comes as responders continue to battle thousands of fires in regions of Arizona, Texas and New Mexico.
The fire in which the rangers died - the Blue Ribbon Fire in Florida's Hamilton County - was burning roughly 85 miles (136 km) north-east of the city of Tallahassee and had previously been considered contained.
""The wildfires have ravaged our state, burning more than 200,000 acres, and now, they have taken the lives of two of our very own men,"" Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam said in a statement.
The deaths mark the first time anyone working for the Florida Division of Forestry has died from fighting a blaze since 2000, when a helicopter pilot crashed after dumping water on a wildfire near the town of Fort Myers."
Typhoon,"Typhoon Wipha, currently located in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, is pushing to the northeast towards Japan over the next 24 hours. It will likely bring heavy rain, gusty winds, and large surf across the east coast of Japan today (October 15, 2013). Fortunately, Wipha is projected to weaken as it moves over cold waters and into an atmosphere that is unfavorable for strengthening as wind shear increases. Still, Typhoon Wipha is likely to add more problems to those trying to fix Japan’s damaged Fukushima nuclear plant, where there have been leaks of radioactive water into the ocean and several workers last week were accidentally doused with radioactive water.
As of October 15 at 9Z (or 5 a.m. EST), the Joint Typhoon Warning Center reports that Typhoon Wipha contains 80-knot winds, which is estimated around 90 miles per hour (mph) or 148 kilometers per hour (kph). The storm is accelerating to the northeast at 17 knots.
At one point, Wipha was a strong Category 4 typhoon with sustained winds around 130 mph this past Sunday. Now, Wipha is transitioning from a tropical system into an extratropical system. What does that mean? It means that its winds will likely expand outward and create a larger impact across Japan today. Rainfall totals of 3-7 inches are possible.
The extra rain and large surf is a major concern for the Fukushima plant trying to recover since the tragic earthquake and tsunami devastated the area back in 2011. Wipha will only complicate matters and result in delays in trying to fix radioactive leaks."

drought,"Drought is a pretty complicated climate extreme to define. Most commonly, it is defined as a precipitation deficit - much less precipitation falls than what is typically expected for a given time period.
But drought can be observed in lots of ways: lack of snowpack, low flows in rivers and streams, dry soils, higher evaporative losses, low lake/reservoir levels, etc. Because the climate varies all the time, it’s a safe assumption to say that all areas experience drought similarly because all areas will see times when precipitation is (or the other water variables) less than average.
But drought is not equally distributed across the U.S. Just as there are climatologically wetter areas and drier areas across the country, the same could be said about the occurrence, frequency, and severity of drought.
So, some might be asking, ""where are the most 'drought-prone' areas?
Drought-Prone States
First, let's look at the states that experience drought most often, according to data from the U.S. Drought Monitor.
The Drought Monitor has been tracking drought conditions across the country since 2000.
Each week, the map is updated with the latest conditions ranging from none, to D0 (which is an “abnormally dry” category), to D1-D4 (which represents increasing severities of drought categories).
How the map is made is a big process that includes analysis of data that encompasses local/regional variability in all the water variables and adds a human component, like impacts."
other,"The Bank of England¡¯s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment.  At its meeting ending on 22 June 2021, the Committee judged that the existing stance of monetary policy remained appropriate.  The MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.1%.  The Committee voted unanimously for the Bank of England to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at ¡ê20 billion.  The Committee voted by a majority of 8-1 for the Bank of England to continue with its existing programme of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, maintaining the target for the stock of these government bond purchases at ¡ê875 billion and so the total target stock of asset purchases at ¡ê895 billion. In the MPC¡¯s central projection in the May Monetary Policy Report, UK GDP was expected to recover strongly over 2021, to pre-Covid-19 (Covid) levels.  Spare capacity in the economy was expected to be eliminated as activity picked up, and there was expected to be a temporary period of excess demand, before demand and supply returned broadly to balance.  CPI inflation was projected to rise temporarily above the 2% target, owing mainly to developments in energy prices.  As these transitory effects faded, conditioned on the market path for interest rates, inflation was expected to return to around 2% in the medium term."
other,"The global expansion is continuing to provide a favourable backdrop for the Australian economy. In the United States growth remains well entrenched, with another solid outcome being posted in the June quarter. In China the rapid expansion seen over recent years is showing no sign of slackening. The Japanese economy, although not generally a significant contributor to world growth in recent years, now seems to be performing better after some disappointing results in 2004. Growth in the rest of east Asia appears reasonably solid this year, while the main weak spot for the world economy remains the euro area. Overall, most official and private-sector forecasts are that world growth will be above average in 2005 and 2006, though below last year's pace. Higher oil prices in recent months have not generally been viewed as endangering the global expansion, but are seen mainly as a sign of continuing demand pressures.The main news in world financial markets recently was the announcement of new exchange rate arrangements for China, involving an immediate appreciation of 2 per cent against the US dollar and the move to a managed peg. While the initial appreciation was small, the new arrangements provide for greater flexibility of the exchange rate over time. This should be of benefit to China in the medium term, as it will help the authorities to gain greater control over their domestic monetary conditions, and hence to contain inflationary pressures in goods and asset markets more effectively. Most other Asian currencies rose in parallel with the Chinese currency. The Australian dollar was little affected, and remains in the same broad range it has been in since late 2004. Aside from the Chinese announcement, there were few major developments in global markets in recent months. Market expectations of monetary policy tightening in the US have increased a little, with the fed funds rate now expected to reach 4 per cent by the end of the year. Global equity markets have remained strong, underpinned by strong company profit results in all the major countries."
drought,"A severe drought is plaguing east China's Anhui Province, leaving crops damaged and drinking water supplies disrupted in some of the hardest-hit regions, local authorities said on Friday.
From Aug. 12 to Oct. 28, the province received an average rainfall of 83.9 milliliters, 60 percent less than the amount in normal years and hitting the second-lowest level since 1961, according to the provincial meteorological department.
A total of 45 cities and counties have been ravaged, with regions in three cities along the Yangtze River suffering from the worst drought in up to 50 years, said the provincial emergency management department.
The drought has affected over 1 million residents and damaged 400,000 hectares of crops, inflicting a direct economic loss of 1.6 billion yuan (227 million U.S. dollars), it said.
The provincial meteorological authority has been using cloud seeding for artificial rain as no precipitation is forecasted in the coming week in most of Anhui.
The provincial water resources department has ordered lower-level authorities to unveil plans to ensure drinking water supply for residents and livestock."
Typhoon,"Short-lived Tropical Storm Bertha offers lessons for Florida As quickly as Bertha raised eyebrows Wednesday it’s already beginning to fade from memory, but the lesson it provides certainly doesn’t. What started as a tropical wave Sunday over Florida with little hope of development, Bertha snapped into a tropical storm just two days later and brought flash flood warnings throughout South Carolina. Bertha didn’t amount to much with its strongest gusts just under 60 mph and bringing about 5 inches of rain to portions of the Charleston area, according to the National Weather Service. Still, the NASCAR-like development of Bertha is a problem for Floridians and other state residents near the tropics as quick rapid maturity is a phenomenon that poses a threat to home owners who let their guard down. Luckily that was not the case for South Carolina residents and its emergency management directors."
other,"The liquidity management framework was refined in April with the objective of meeting short-term liquidity needs through regular facilities, frictional and seasonal mismatches through fine-tuning operations and more durable liquidity needs for facilitating growth by modulating net foreign assets and net domestic assets. The Reserve Bank has conducted liquidity management consistent with this framework, progressively moving the system level ex ante liquidity conditions to close to neutrality. In Q3 up to early November, liquidity conditions remained in mild surplus mode. The Reserve Bank injected liquidity of _1.1 trillion through OMO purchases during the fiscal year so far, including an OMO purchase auction of _100 billion in October. Although the replacement of SBNs has engendered large surplus liquidity warranting exceptional operations, this needs to be seen as transitory. The Reserve Bank is committed to conducting liquidity operations in pursuit of the objectives of the revised framework put in place in April to restore system level liquidity to a position of neutrality as the surplus liquidity pressures abate. In the view of the Committee, this bi-monthly review is set against the backdrop of heightened uncertainty. Globally, the imminent tightening of monetary policy in the US is triggering bouts of high volatility in financial markets, with the possibility of large spillovers that could have macroeconomic implications for EMEs. In India, while supply disruptions in the backwash of currency replacement may drag down growth this year, it is important to analyse more information and experience before judging their full effects and their persistence _ short-term developments that influence the outlook disproportionately warrant caution with respect to setting the monetary policy stance. If the impact is transient as widely expected, growth should rebound strongly. Turning to inflation, food prices other than vegetables are exhibiting sustained firmness and a pick-up in momentum. Another disconcerting feature of recent developments is the downward inflexibility in inflation excluding food and fuel which could set a resistance level for future downward movements in the headline. Moreover, volatility in crude prices and the surge in financial market turbulence could put the inflation target for Q4 of 2016-17 at some risk. Given these indicators of underlying inflation, it is appropriate to look through the transitory but unclear effects of the withdrawal of SBNs while setting the monetary policy stance. On balance, therefore, it is prudent to wait and watch how these factors play out and impinge upon the outlook. Accordingly, the policy repo rate has been kept on hold in this review, while retaining an accommodative policy stance.Six members voted in favour of the monetary policy decision. The minutes of the MPC¡¯s meeting will be published on December 21, 2016. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled on February 7 & 8, 2017 and its resolution will be placed on the Reserve Bank¡¯s website on February 8, 2017."
other,"Growing up in the small community of Harrow in southern Australia, 86-year-old Lachie Turner spent his childhood hearing legends of the great Aboriginal cricketer Johnny Mullagh.
""The story used to be that he could win a match, batting with just the handle of a pickaxe,"" said Turner, with a smile.
Mullagh was a hero in Harrow, and the surrounding livestock communities, where homesteads dot the landscape along miles of single-lane dirt roads.
At a time when being Indigenous meant you could be thrown off your land, forced into Christian missions or even shot, Mullagh -- of the Jardwadjali people from western Victoria -- grew from being a farmhand on a local estate to a world-famous cricket player.
Yet until recently, most Australians didn't know Mullagh's story, or anything about the journey that took him and 12 Aboriginal cricketers from farmsteads in Victoria, to Melbourne, Sydney and then, finally, England in 1868 -- making them Australia's first sporting team to play overseas.
But when the Aboriginal cricket team returned in 1869, their achievements couldn't save them from the institutional racism shown by colonizers towards First Nations people. Most of the team were immediately placed in missions, away from their communities and their homes. When they died some were buried in unmarked graves.
They were never paid for their historic tour.
Now, more than a century later, Australia's cricketing bodies are seeking to give the Indigenous team the recognition they deserve. The team is increasingly referred to as ""Australia's First XI,"" a term usually reserved for a region's best cricket line-up.
On the 150th anniversary of their England tour in 2018, an all-Indigneous team was sent to the UK in their honor -- with each young player taking the name of one of Australia's First XI. Last December, Mullagh, whose Aboriginal name was Unaarrimin, was inducted into Australia's cricketing Hall of Fame and a medal created in his honor.
Paul Stewart, deputy chief executive of Australia's Lowitja Institute and a Taungurung man from central Victoria, said he felt both ""pride and sadness"" when he thought of the story of Australia's First XI, and what they accomplished."

Total foodgrains production for 2017-18 is estimated at 277.5 million tonnes, up by 0.9 per cent from the level of 2016-17, with the production of rice, pulses and coarse cereals estimated to reach a record high. Wheat production is estimated to be lower than last year due to a decline in acreage and low soil moisture, but imports of 1.6 million tonnes and comfortable buffer stocks should cushion potential adverse effects. Horticulture production touched a new peak of 305.4 million tonnes in 2017-18, up by 1.6 per cent from last year.For the year 2017-18 as a whole, the CSO estimates that value added in industry decelerated in relation to the previous year; in terms of quarterly performance, however, expansion set in by Q2 and was built upon in Q3 and Q4. This was mainly driven by the rebound in manufacturing. The manufacturing PMI remained in an expansionary mode for the eighth consecutive month in March, although there was some moderation in Q4. Assessment of overall business sentiment for manufacturing also improved in Q4 as reflected in the Reserve Bank¡¯s Industrial Outlook Survey, driven by increasing output and new orders. Growth of value added in the services sector accelerated through the year, driven by trade, hotels, transport and communication and a significant pick-up in construction activity. Other high frequency indicators of services sector activity such as domestic air passenger traffic, international freight traffic, port traffic and commercial vehicles sales also expanded at a fair pace. The services PMI moved out of contraction and stabilised in March on a renewed increase in new business and strengthening expectations."

drought,"A severe drought in Chile's central region is entering its 10th year, setting a record for the country's longest dry-spell ever. Records since 1915, when the nation started data-keeping, showed that no droughts have lasted longer and that the previous megadrought of this scale likely occurred more than 1 000 years ago.
Over the past 10 years, rainfall in central Chile has been below normal every year by an average of 20 to 45 percent, which is extremely low. Around the capital Santiago (population 7 million), lack of rain has been particularly severe. Between 2014 and 2019, only 10 to 20 percent of normal rainfall has been recorded.
In 2019, the greater Santiago area in Valparaiso saw rainfall almost 80 percent below the previous record low. It was down by 90 percent in the northern region of Coquimbo.
According to Rene D. Garreaud, a scientist at the University of Chile, they are estimating that the last 'megadrought' of this scale probably occurred in this region more than 1 000 years ago.
The absence of significant rains has had long-term consequences, especially for farmers. Last year, the Ministry of Agriculture declared agricultural emergencies for more than 50 municipalities as tens of thousands of farm animals perished, and many others are at risk. Water supply systems are strained and reservoirs are drying.
Satellite images taken by the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat-8 show the drastic four-year difference of water levels at El Yeso, one of the main reservoirs in Santiago.
The first image was taken in March 2016, when the reservoir held about 219 million cubic m of water (7.7 billion cubic feet).
The second image was captured in March 2020, when the volume plummeted to 99 million cubic m (3 billion cubic feet)-- about 40 percent of capacity."

It is understood that it will take a number of days for the Health Service Executive (HSE) to get the system for vaccinating those from 12 to 15 up and running, as it will require parental consent and parents or guardians will have to be present for the jabs."
Typhoon,"A deadly tropical cyclone has destroyed as much as 90 per cent of the Mozambique city of Beira, raising fears for more than 500,000 people.
Cyclone Idai brought devastation to the major coastal city of half a million people on Thursday night with winds of up to 106 mph, before moving to Zimbabwe and Malawi, Red Cross said.
The damage was “massive and horrifying”, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Society (IFRC) said after surveying the worst-hit areas via helicopter.
Images on social media and local television showed billboards and rooftops blown off, trees snapped and electricity cables left fallen in the city’s streets.
President Filipe Nyusi said he believed the storm could be the deadliest to hit the southeast African country, adding that it was “a real disaster of great proportions”.
Appearing on state radio, he described seeing “bodies floating” in the water after two rivers broke their banks and “wiped out entire villages”. He said he expected the death toll, which currently stands at 84, to rise significantly to more than 1,000 deaths.
The United Nations’ humanitarian office said on Friday that electricity and communications in the city had been cut off by the cyclone.
It also warned of devastation outside Beira, in particular of livestock and crops, adding that the damage took place just before the main harvest season, which could exacerbate food insecurity in the region."
other,"Powell says Fed officials haven¡¯t lowered their economic growth forecasts because of the Trump administration¡¯s moves to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. But he says Federal Reserve Bank presidents around the country have heard concerns from businesses in their districts about the impact of the tariffs.¡°Trade policy has become a concern going forward for that group,¡± he says, referring to business leaders.But among Fed officials meeting in Washington Tuesday and Wednesday, Powell says, ¡°There¡¯s no thought that changes in trade policy should have any effect on the current outlook.¡±Powell says in his first press conference that he is thinking about holding more press briefings than his predecessor, Janet Yellen.¡°That is something I am carefully considering, have not made a decision yet,¡± he said.Currently the Fed holds four press conferences a year, following meetings when they issue their quarterly economic projections. It¡¯s a practice instituted by Former Fed chairman Ben Bernanke. Yet the Fed actually meets eight times a year. Many analysts expect rate increases will only be announced during those four meetings, so adding press conferences could give the Fed more flexibility in the timing of future rate hikes.
"
other,"The global growth and trade outlook is clouded by rising protectionist tensions. The direct impact of the recently announced tariffs by the US on India¡¯s exports is likely to be modest;8 however, the increase in US tariffs could lead to a supply glut in non-US markets and push prices down, resulting in lower export realisations for third party exporters like India. These risks appear to be materialising as the affected countries retaliate and protect domestic markets as already evident in tit-for-tat tariffs by the US and China. These developments could lead to a global trade slowdown with hysteresis, which, in turn, could diminish welfare, especially for countries looking to leverage on global trade to meet their growth aspirations.As regards financial flows in 2018-19 so far, net foreign direct investment (FDI) flows increased by 2.9 per cent in April-July 2018 over the corresponding period of the previous year. By contrast, FPI flows recorded net outflows of US$ 11.5 billion till September 28, 2018, reflecting mainly global portfolio rebalancing away from EMEs. While net receipts on account of non-resident deposits almost tripled in Q1:2018-19 from their level a year ago, both external commercial borrowings (ECBs) and short-term trade credit recorded outflows during the same period. Keeping in view the capital needs of the corporate sector, all-in-cost norms and end-use provisions were rationalised and the list of eligible borrowers was expanded for ECBs in April 2018. Despite the drawdown of reserves since April 2018, India¡¯s forex reserves at US$ 400.5 billion as on September 28, 2018 were at a comfortable level _ equivalent to 10 months of imports and 182 per cent of short-term external debt (by residual maturity)."
other,"In keeping with the Government¡¯s Start-up India initiative, the Reserve Bank will take steps to ease doing business and contribute to an ecosystem that is conducive for growth of start-ups. These measures will create an enabling framework for receiving foreign venture capital, differing contractual structures embedded in investment instruments, deferring receipt of considerations for transfer of ownership, facilities for escrow arrangements and simplification of documentation and reporting procedures. A detailed statement is being issued separately.The current momentum of growth is reasonable, though below what should be expected over the medium term. Underlying growth drivers need to be rekindled to place the economy durably on a higher growth trajectory. The revival of private investment, in particular, has a crucial role, especially as the climate for business improves and fiscal policy continues to consolidate. The Indian economy is currently being viewed as a beacon of stability because of the steady disinflation, a modest current account deficit and commitment to fiscal rectitude. This needs to be maintained so that the foundations of stable and sustainable growth are strengthened. The Reserve Bank continues to be accommodative even as it leaves the policy rate unchanged in this review, while awaiting further data on the development of inflation. Structural reforms in the forthcoming Union Budget that boost growth while controlling spending will create more space for monetary policy to support growth, while also ensuring that inflation remains on the projected path of 5 per cent by the end of 2016-17."
wildfires,"Fires in Brazil’s Amazon increased 13% in the first nine months of the year compared with a year ago, as the rainforest region experiences its worst rash of blazes in a decade, data from space research agency Inpe has shown.
Satellites in September recorded 32,017 hotspots in the world’s largest rainforest, a 61% rise from the same month in 2019.
In August last year, surging fires in the Amazon captured global headlines and prompted criticism from world leaders such as France’s Emmanuel Macron that Brazil was not doing enough to protect the rainforest.
On Tuesday, the US Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, called for a world effort to offer $20bn to end Amazon deforestation and threatened Brazil with unspecified “economic consequences” if it did not “stop tearing down the forest”.
President Jair Bolsonaro lambasted Biden’s comment as a “cowardly threat” to Brazil’s sovereignty and a “clear sign of contempt”.
Data from Inpe released on Thursday showed that in 2019, fires spiked in August and declined considerably the month after, but this year’s peak has been more sustained. Both August and September of 2020 have matched or surpassed last year’s single-month high.
“We have had two months with a lot of fire. It’s already worse than last year,” said Ane Alencar, science director for Brazil’s Amazon Environmental Research Institute (Ipam).
“It could get worse if the drought continues. We are at the mercy of the rain.”
The Amazon is experiencing a more severe dry season than last year, which scientists attribute in part to warming in the tropical North Atlantic Ocean pulling moisture away from South America.
The entire Amazon, which spans nine countries, currently has 28,892 active fires, according to a fire monitoring tool funded in part by the US space agency, Nasa.
The fires in September are not only burning recently deforested areas and farmland, where ranchers set them to clear land, but are also increasingly burning virgin forest, a worrying trend that suggests the rainforest is becoming drier and more prone to fire.
Roughly 62% of major Amazon fires were in forests in September, compared with only 15% in August, according to an analysis of satellite images by the US-based non-profit Amazon Conservation.
The warming of the North Atlantic is also helping drive drought in the Brazilian Pantanal, the world’s largest wetland, which has suffered more fires this year than ever previously recorded, according to Inpe data.
A Federal University of Rio de Janeiro analysis found that 23% of the wetlands, which are home to the densest population of jaguars in the world, has burned.
“Brazil is on fire,” said Cristiane Mazzetti, a forest campaigner for advocacy group Greenpeace Brasil, in a statement."
Typhoon,"While tropical systems in the Atlantic Basin have been sputtering, leaving many breathing a sigh of relief, a typhoon in the Western Pacific had thousands of Americans on edge.
Danas, at one time a typhoon packing winds of 145 miles per hour, made a beeline toward the Japanese island of Okinawa. Okinawa is the home to Kadena Air Force base, which houses more than 18,000 American military personnel and their families. Luckily, Danas didn't make a direct hit on the island or the base and no immediate reports of damage were available.  
In an email to The Weather Channel the public affairs office on Kadena Air Force base says they used a graduated system of warnings, ranging from TC-4 to TC-1.  TC-4 is a general state of readiness where people have the basic essentials already stocked away. TC-1 is where 50 knot or greater winds are expected within 12 hours.  It also means that all facilities, except mission critical components, will be closed and people should fill available containers with drinking water.  While at TC-1 earlier in the day Tuesday, the bas has now been backed down to TC-4 and normal activities can resume.
As for staying informed about the latest, in the States, Kadena's public affairs office says this: ""Stateside friends and family like the Kadena Air Base Facebook page, and many people have already liked that page so they can keep up with what their family and friends are doing overseas.""
 Danas quickly weakened to a tropical storm after crossing the Japanese island of Tsushima, between South Korea and the Japanese mainland. And continued on a northeasterly course.
According to South Korean broadcaster KBS, Busan port closed for a bit as the former typhoon passed the region. The port is South Korea's largest."
flood,USA – Emergency Declared After Floods in Louisiana Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency after severe flooding in the state. Lake Charles and surrounding areas of Calcasieu Parish recorded more than 15 inches / 381 mm of rain in 12 hours on 17 May 2021. Lake Charles Mayor Nic Hunter said this was the third heaviest rain event in the history of the city. He speculated that more structures have been flooded than were during the 2020 hurricanes Laura and Delta combined. He said early assessments suggest “at minimum 400 to 500″ buildings have been flooded. Emergency crews received hundreds of calls for flood rescues from people trapped in their homes.
drought,"About 42% of India’s land area is facing drought, with 6% exceptionally dry--four times the spatial extent of drought last year, according to data for the week ending March 26, 2019, from the Drought Early Warning System (DEWS), a real-time drought monitoring platform.
Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Maharashtra, parts of the North-East, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Telangana are the worst hit. These states are home to 500 million people, almost 40% of the country’s population.
While the central government has not declared drought anywhere so far, the state governments of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Odisha and Rajasthan have declared many of their districts as drought-hit.
“Before monsoon, which is still far away, the next two or three months are going to be difficult in many of these regions,” Vimal Mishra, associate professor at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Gandhinagar, and the developer of DEWS, told IndiaSpend.
Failed monsoon rains are the primary reason for the current situation. The North-East monsoon, also known as ‘post-monsoon rainfall’ (October-December) that provides 10-20% of India’s rainfall, was deficient by 44% in 2018 from the long-term normal of 127.2 mm, as per data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD). This compounded the rainfall deficit in the South-West (SW) monsoon (June-September) that provides 80% of India’s rainfall, which fell short by 9.4% in 2018--close to the 10% deficit range when the IMD declares a drought.
India has experienced widespread drought every year since 2015, Mishra said, with the exception of 2017. As the El Nino--the unusual warming of the equatorial Pacific Ocean that makes Indian summers warmer and reduces rainfall--looms over the 2019 SW monsoon, pre-monsoon showers (March-May) this year have also been deficient. India has received 36% less rainfall than the long-term average between March 1 and March 28, 2019, as per IMD data. The southern peninsular region recorded the lowest, a deficit greater than 60%.
Lower rainfall has reduced water levels in reservoirs across the country. The amount of water available in the country’s 91 major reservoirs has gone down 32 percentage points over five months to March 22, 2019. In 31 reservoirs of southern states, water level has gone down by 36 percentage points over five months.
The drought could further worsen farm distress, exacerbate groundwater extraction, increase migration from rural to urban areas, and further inflame water conflicts between states and between farms, cities and industries.
Yet, the latest drought manual issued in 2016 by the central government makes the process of declaring drought long and difficult, experts say, with the result that drought may go officially unannounced. This means relief measures such as drinking water supply, subsidised diesel and electricity for irrigation, increased number of days of insured work under National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) are not taken. And elections may further delay government acknowledgement and action.
This is the first of a six-part series on drought and its impact in five affected regions--Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Rajasthan."
Typhoon,"At least 10,000 people are thought to have died in the central Philippine province of Leyte after_yphoon Haiyan, one of the strongest storms ever to make landfall, lashed the area, swallowing coastal towns, a senior police official said early on Sunday morning.
About 70-80% of the buildings in the area in the path of Haiyan in Leyte province was destroyed, said chief superintendent Elmer Soria. ""We had a meeting last night with the governor and the other officials. The governor said based on their estimate, 10,000 died,"" he said.
Tacloban city administrator Tecson Lim said that the death toll in that city alone ""could go up to 10,000"". Tacloban is the provincial capital of Leyte, with a population of more than 200,000. The Philippine Red Cross said in Tacloban bodies had been found ""piled up around the roads"" and in churches. Between 300 and 400 bodies had been recovered, Lim said.
On Samar island, which faces Tacloban, Leo Dacaynos of the provincial disaster office told Associated Press on Sunday 300 people were confirmed dead in Basey town and another 2,000 were missing.
He said the storm surge caused sea waters to rise 20 feet when the typhoon hit. There were still towns on Samar that had not been reached, he said, and appealed for food and water. Power was knocked out and there was no mobile signal, making communication possible only by radio.
Many corpses hung on tree branches, buildings and sidewalks, Associated Press reported.
""On the way to the airport we saw many bodies along the street,"" said Philippine-born Australian Mila Ward, 53, who was waiting at the Tacloban airport to catch a military flight back to Manila.
""They were covered with just anything tarpaulin, roofing sheets, cardboards,"" she said. Asked how many, she said, ""Well over 100 where we passed.""
The super-typhoon made landfall on Samar and Leyte islands in the eastern Visayas at about 4.40am on Friday local time, with winds up to 315km/h (195mph) tearing roofs off buildings, turning roads into rivers full of debris and knocking out electricity pylons.
With many provinces left without power or telecommunications, and airports in the hardest-hit areas, such as Tacloban, in tatters, experts say it is impossible to know the extent of the storm's damage _ or deliver badly needed aid.
Roughly 12 hours after the 600km (370-mile)-wide Haiyan blew west towards Vietnam, where it is expected to make landfall early on Sunday, officials and aid workers are only now beginning to piece together details on the number of dead and injured.
Government figures showed that more than 4 million had been directly affected. The World Food Programme has mobilised some $2m (£1.25m) in aid and aims to deliver 40 tonnes of fortified biscuits to victims within the next few days.
Satellite images show normally green patches of vegetation ripped up into brown squares of debris in Tacloban, where local TV channel GMA broadcast images of huge storm surges, flattened buildings and families traipsing through flooded streets with their possessions held high above the water.
The head of the UN Disaster Assessment Co-ordination Team, Sebastian Rhodes Stampa, described ""destruction on a massive scale"" in the city of 220,000 and said: ""The last time I saw something of this scale was in the aftermath of the Indian Ocean tsunami. There are cars thrown like tumbleweed and the streets are strewn with debris.""
Al-Jazeera correspondent Jamela Alindogan was trapped in her hotel as the eye of the storm passed overhead and ripped the roof off the building. Evoking scenes of chaos as badly hurt victims wandered the streets without medicine, food or water, and doctors at the local hospital attended to the wounded in the dark without electricity or candlelight, she said: ""There is no food, not even in the hotels, and there's no water. The situation is really very desperate.""
Other sources told of victims trying to climb out from under rubble to find assistance, and mobs rampaging through the streets looking for food, water or medicine, and looting electrical goods and groceries from malls. ""Almost all the houses were destroyed,"" said Major Rey Balido of the_hilippines_ational disaster agency. ""Only a few are left standing.""
Relatives of those living in the typhoon's path have had no news from their loved ones and are nervously waiting until power is restored to the area. ""I spoke to my mother just a few hours before the typhoon made landfall in my city, Tacloban,"" said taxi driver Sherwin Martinata, 32, in the capital, Manila. ""She was saying she was all right but now I have no idea if my family is safe. There is no power, no phones. I can't get through at all. I'm worried, but I'm powerless.""
Those living in the hardest-hit areas, such as the eastern Visayas, are among the poorest in the Philippines, say aid agencies, who warn that there will be little or no savings for many of the victims to fall back on _ putting an already vulnerable population at even greater risk of future food and job insecurity.
On Bohol island _ where a 7.3-magnitude earthquake toppled colonial-era churches and killed some 200 people last month _ residents were successfully evacuated ahead of the storm and as a result many lives were probably saved, said Mathias Eick of the European commission's humanitarian aid department (Echo). However, because the island's main power supply comes from neighbouring Leyte, residents are still without electricity or water.
In Tacloban, where many residents live along the coast, the sheer force of the storm was just too much for the buildings to withstand, with evacuation centres such as stadiums and churches later collapsing. ""The sheer magnitude and scale of the disaster sort of overpowered all the contingency measures, and we're fearing that we'll be finding more dead bodies in those evacuation centres themselves,"" said Alwynn Javier of Christian Aid.
Without information on the ground or access to hard-hit areas, aid agencies have been stuck, not knowing how much aid is needed or which areas need it most.
""The only information we have been able to get so far is from the UN and some from the news,"" said Javier. ""We should have good ground reach, but are really impeded by this lack of access because even our partners on the ground have been hit themselves.""
Officials and rescue workers hoped that Sunday would see concerted efforts by authorities to set up command centres and rescue groups, which will in turn help bring supplies to those who need them most. But gaining access to those areas will prove hard, said Richard Gordon of the Philippine Red Cross, who added that without bulldozers or tractors to clear paths, volunteers will have to bring cutting equipment to clear uprooted trees and debris.
The Philippines sees roughly 20 typhoons every year, with some more devastating than others. Last year's Typhoon Bopha killed more than 1,100 people and caused over $1bn in damage.
Haiyan _ the 25th typhoon to hit the Philippines this year _ is expected to make landfall in several provinces in central Vietnam with winds around 220km/h (137mph). More than 450,000 troops have been deployed, as well as 12 planes, 356 ships and thousands of vehicles, in order to mobilise supplies, with more than 300,000 people evacuated in Da Nang and Quang Ngai provinces.
""It may be the strongest storm to hit Vietnam in history,"" said Vietnam's director of the Central Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting Centre in Bui Minh Tang. Coastal areas should expect to see waves as high as 5-8 meters (16-26ft) and a wind radius up to 500km wide, officials warned."
other,"Strengthening our financial regulatory system is essential for the long-term economic stability of the nation. Among the lessons of the crisis are the crucial importance of macroprudential regulation--that is, regulation and supervision aimed at addressing risks to the financial system as a whole--and the need for effective consolidated supervision of every financial institution that is so large or interconnected that its failure could threaten the functioning of the entire financial system.The Federal Reserve strongly supports the Congress's ongoing efforts to achieve comprehensive financial reform. In the meantime, to strengthen the Federal Reserve's oversight of banking organizations, we have been conducting an intensive self-examination of our regulatory and supervisory responsibilities and have been actively implementing improvements. For example, the Federal Reserve has been playing a key role in international efforts to toughen capital and liquidity requirements for financial institutions, particularly systemically critical firms, and we have been taking the lead in ensuring that compensation structures at banking organizations provide appropriate incentives without encouraging excessive risk-taking.The Federal Reserve is also making fundamental changes in its supervision of large, complex bank holding companies, both to improve the effectiveness of consolidated supervision and to incorporate a macroprudential perspective that goes beyond the traditional focus on safety and soundness of individual institutions. We are overhauling our supervisory framework and procedures to improve coordination within our own supervisory staff and with other supervisory agencies and to facilitate more-integrated assessments of risks within each holding company and across groups of companies."
