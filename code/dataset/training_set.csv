flood,"Missouri woman who drowned after driving into flood waters in Clinton County identified GOWER, Mo. — The Missouri State Highway Patrol has identified the victim of a drowning incident late Friday night in Clinton County.  The incident occurred just before midnight Friday at Castile Creek on NW County Line Road, about 2 miles south of Gower.  The highway patrol reports the driver of a Jeep entered water that was over the roadway and was swept off the side of the road. The driver of the vehicle was unable to exit the vehicle and drowned."
other,"The increase in HRA for central government employees, which became effective from July 2017 and continued to accumulate till December 2017, shaped the path of headline inflation during Q3, with unseasonal hardening of prices of vegetables, accentuating a spike to 4.9 per cent in November. While prices of vegetables did undergo a shallower than usual moderation in December, an unfavourable base effect came into play, pulling up inflation to a peak of 5.2 per cent in December. In Q4, headline inflation moderated with a fall in momentum due to a delayed but steep reversal in prices of vegetables (Chart II.3).The distribution of inflation across CPI groups in 2017-18 had striking similarities as well as divergences with last year¡¯s experience. While median and modal inflation were similar, the continuing deflation in pulses gave the inflation distribution a considerable negative skew this year in contrast to the positive skew generated by high sugar and pulses inflation during 2016-17 (Chart II.4). Diffusion indices3 of price changes in CPI items suggest that on a seasonally adjusted basis, after an uptick in Q3:2017-18, the situation reversed in January-February, with the prices of a number of goods, particularly of food items, registering decline (Chart II.5)."
other,"When the character Bear is visited by the spirit of an unknown warrior in the series premiere of ""Reservation Dogs,"" he asks if the man before him is ""Crazy Horse"" or another legendary Native American leader.
It turns out, however, that the man in the beads and feathers is not the kind of brave or formidable Native hero long romanticized in Hollywood. The unknown warrior instead departed this earth in a most anticlimactic fashion -- his horse tripped over a gopher hole and squashed him dead before the battle even started.
""The spirit world is cold,"" he tells Bear. ""My nipples are always hard.""
It's a deeply clever and funny scene, one that flips the tired trope of the Indigenous warrior on its head. It winks at Native viewers in the audience, who are all too used to seeing stereotypical portrayals of their people on screen. And it gently mocks those who still think of Native people as relics of the past, as if to say, ""C'mon ... really?”
""It's bringing non-Natives into the joke and saying, 'Hey, this is what you think we look like and we're gonna let you laugh at it with us,'"" Sterlin Harjo, a Seminole and Muscogee filmmaker who created ""Reservation Dogs"" with Taika Waititi, told CNN. ""'But it's crazy that you think we still dress like that.'"""
flood,"Heavy rains causing flooding in parts of lake area In an effort to mitigate downstream flooding, Truman Dam has ceased generation at their power plant while Ameren Missouri has cut generation at Lake of the Ozarks.  Depending on the location, as of Monday morning, the lake area had received about 2.5 inches of rain in the previous 48 hours compounded by another 3 to 4 inches in the 72 hours prior to those measurements, according to the National Weather Service in Springfield.  The change in generation at Truman and Bagnell Dam on Lake of the Ozarks is an effort to decrease the water flowing downstream on the Osage River to the Missouri River. The Missouri River continues to rise.  Working in conjunction with the U.S. Corps of Engineers, Truman stopped generation to hold water back from Lake of the Ozarks. Ameren Missouri will only be generating what is necessary to release water that flows in from tributaries and run-off caused by the rain.  Chances of rain are in the forecast through the week before clearing skies on Friday, just in time for the Fourth of July weekend. The weekend forecast is currently showing sunny skies with highs in the 80s."
drought,"he Obama administration is sending disaster response teams to northern Ethiopia to try to address a humanitarian emergency and avoid a national security risk to the U.S. should the drought there spiral out of control.
Experts are predicting northern Ethiopia will experience the worst drought in generations, one that will surpass the 1984 famine that killed one million men, women and children and galvanized stars like Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder and Bruce Springsteen to record the 1985 charity song ""We are the World.""
The Ethiopian government -- a major partner in U.S. counterterrorism efforts -- estimates that 10.2 million people will need food assistance, on top of about 8 million people who are chronically food insecure, and up to 2 million people will need safe drinking water. The United Nations estimates that as many as 15 million Ethiopians could suffer acute malnutrition or worse unless more help is found.
""We are acting to prevent a major humanitarian crisis and protect Ethiopia's hard-earned development progress,"" Gayle Smith, administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, said Thursday In announcing the deployment of a Disaster Assistance Response Team.
She also called on additional countries to pitch in.
""Other donors must also step-up their responses now,"" she said.
Intervening isn't just a moral issue but also a matter of national security, U.S. officials said.
""Climate-related threats pose an urgent and growing threat to our national security, contributing to increased natural disasters, refugee flows and potential conflicts over basic resources like food and water,"" said USAID spokesman Ben Edwards.
The U.S. is concerned that conditions could lead to instability, that a situation where there's a lack of food and jobs could encourage young people to join extremist groups while refugees flows destabilize population centers.
Ethiopia works with the U.S. on threats in the Horn of Africa, a conflict-ridden area plagued by the terrorism of al-Shabaab, among other groups. The area encompasses Sudan, Somalia and Djibouti -- home to the U.S. naval expeditionary base Camp Lemonnier -- as well as Sudan, Kenya and Ethiopia. Events in the region often impact Yemen, Libya and Egypt.
In January, a bipartisan group of lawmakers visited the Ethiopian capital to express support for the country's help on regional threats.
Rep. Ed Royce, the California Republican who heads the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said that thanks to Ethiopia's ""efforts to confront extremism, al-Shabaab has not expanded footholds in the Horn of Africa"" and commended its contributions to peacekeeping missions.
Smith, of USAID, said the administration will send an elite team of nearly 20 disaster experts to provide technical assistance, conduct humanitarian assessments and coordinate relief efforts with partners on the ground. She also said that the U.S. would provide nearly $4 million in maize and wheat seed for more than 226,000 households.
Ethiopia has made strides in creating greater food stability, according to the U.N., but its ability to predict the severity of this drought, after unreliable rainy seasons in the north, was complicated by an ocean-warming El Niño that scientists say is altering weather worldwide, bringing drought to California and unseasonably warm days in New York.
While international assistance is arriving, Ethiopia is also competing for aid with human disasters unfolding in war-ravaged Syria and Yemen and a refugee crisis in Europe, all of which are contributing to donor fatigue, experts say.
The new U.S. funds announced by Smith today add to more than $532 million in humanitarian assistance to Ethiopia since October 2014 for emergency food assistance, safe drinking water and nutrition and health support. Some of that money went to better prepare Ethiopia and other Horn countries for natural calamities like these that are almost predictable."
drought,"The U.S. Drought Monitor recently reported that, for the first time in its nearly 20-year history, none of the contiguous states was showing symptoms of severe or exceptional drought. That report includes Arizona, as this year’s abnormally wet May helped push the state out of a 10-year drought period.
According to the monitor’s weekly report for late last week, only 20.5% of Arizona was showing moderate drought or “abnormally dry” symptoms. Data for the same week in 2018 found 100% of the state in moderate drought or abnormally dry, with a majority of the state experiencing severe (97%) or extreme drought (73.2%).
Richard Heim, a meteorologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Centers for Environmental Information, said the change was tied to this year’s wet spring.
“Rain and snow have been falling in the areas that needed it, so the drought’s contracted a lot,” he said.
Arizona is no stranger to downpours in the monsoon season, which runs June 15 to Sept. 30, according the National Weather Service, but heavy rain and snowfall in spring isn’t typical for the Southwest.
State climatologist Nancy Selover said the increased rain and snow came from winter storms over the Southwest that lingered longer and provided more moisture than in the past."
other,"In April this year, MAS shifted from a zero percent appreciation path to a policy of modest and gradual appreciation of the S$NEER, against a more favourable growth outlook for the Singapore economy and the risk of rising inflationary pressures.  The width of the policy band was kept unchanged.  In the event, the economy grew strongly by 11.9% in Q2 2004 on a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis, while CPI inflation increased to 1.9% from 1.4% in Q1.  The labour market also strengthened with some 10,900 jobs created in Q2. At the time of the release of the Monetary Policy Statement (MPS) in April, the S$NEER had appreciated to the upper end of the policy band.  Following the announcement, the S$NEER trended downwards, largely reflecting a general strengthening of the US dollar against major currencies and concerns over the implications for the region of a marked slowdown in the Chinese economy.  Since mid-August, the S$NEER has reverted to an appreciating trend, reflecting a general weakening of the US dollar and stronger capital inflows to the region with greater optimism over the regional outlook.  (Chart 1)Monetary conditions have generally tightened since mid-2004.  Domestic inter-bank rates have risen in tandem with the 75 basis point increase in the US federal funds rate since June.  Having remained unchanged at 0.75% over the first five months of this year, the three-month domestic interbank rate rose to 0.81% by end-June, and further to 1.44% by end-September.  However, reflecting the ample liquidity in the banking system, retail interest rates have thus far remained unchanged.  Meanwhile, lending activities in the domestic banking sector have continued to improve gradually, supported by an increase in housing loans, and to a lesser extent, credit extended to the corporate sector, as business prospects improved."
drought,"However WaterAid India's Head of Policy, Nitya Jacob, says groundwater levels are so depleted that even if a good monsoon comes in June -- and meteorologists predict there will be one that ends the drought -- it won't be enough.
""Even if the monsoon is good, it cannot compensate,"" Jacob told CNN.
Central Water Commission data shows that India's major reservoirs are 79% empty, and 75% of India's basins are holding less water than the 10-year average.
CNN Meteorologist, Michael Guy, says this is usually the hottest time for the subcontinent, but this year has seen abnormally high temperatures.
""India is currently in their summer or pre-monsoon season, which lasts from April to late May, or early June,"" says Guy.
""This year we've seen temperatures range from the lower 40s to as high as 47˚C or 116˚Fahrenheit. For some, this is three to five degrees (Celsius) above normal.""
And critically, the past two monsoon seasons have seen below average rainfall.
""This has had a huge impact on groundwater supplies,"" says Jacob."
wildfires,"One of the state’s worst wildfire seasons in history has scorched 5 million acres of tundra and forests across Alaska, and experts here fear climate change will cause even more devastating fires through a combination of lower snowpack, drying tundra and melting permafrost.
Like an insulating blanket, snow reduces fire risk by keeping trees and grasses cold and damp. If less snow accumulates, or worse, snow covers less of the state than normal, there will be nothing to stop the near-constant summer sun from drying out the tundra and the permafrost layer below it. Permafrost, which is mostly composed of organic material, burns easily once thawed and lightning strikes.
Anchorage, for example, had its least snowy winter on record, with just over two feet of snow, the National Weather Service reported.
“We’re looking at, potentially over time, more fires burning more area,” said Kent Slaughter, the manager of the federal Bureau of Land Management’s Alaska Fire Service.
From the U.S. Army’s Fort Wainwright, Slaughter commands an army of firefighters, smokejumpers, logistics experts, pilots and supply clerks to coordinate battles most residents of the Lower 48 don't know are even happening. At the height of the fire season in early July, Slaughter and his teams were battling two wildfires that were each nearly three times bigger than any blaze in the rest of the country."
Typhoon,"A massive typhoon crossed over Okinawa on Sunday, bringing winds more ferocious than even the typhoon-weary Japanese island has seen in decades.
Typhoon Bolaven, with wind gusts that reached as high as 259 kilometers per hour (161 mph), is the strongest to strike the region in nearly 50 years. And with a cloud field of 2,000 kilometers (1,250 miles), it is 20 times larger than Okinawa's length.
""It's been very, very severe,"" said storm chaser James Reynolds, who was on the northwestern coast of the island during the worst of the storm.
Tree branches were flying through the air amid torrential rain, he said.
Speaking to CNN early Monday morning on Okinawa, Reynolds said, ""It's been a long and rough night.""
""The eye of the typhoon actually crashed ashore just after dark. ... Like the rest of the population we all just kind of holed up in the strong and sturdy buildings which make up Okinawa,"" he said.
The infrastructure on Okinawa is designed to withstand violent storms. ""Everything's made of solid concrete,"" said Reynolds.
The last storm of this scale was Typhoon Naha in 1956."
other,"In India, a tentative economic recovery is underway, but is still far from robust. In agriculture, sown area has expanded modestly from a year ago, reflecting the timely and robust onset of the monsoon in June, but the southwest monsoon is currently deficient by 14 per cent _ with production-weighted rainfall deficiency at 20 per cent. Nevertheless, the first advance estimates indicate that food grain production is expected to be higher than last year, reflecting actions taken to contain the adverse effects of rain deficiency through timely advisories and regular monitoring of seed and fertiliser availability. Allied farm activities, which are more insulated from the monsoon, remain resilient and could partly offset the effects of adverse weather on crop production. Rural demand, however, remains subdued as reflected in still shrinking tractor and two-wheeler sales.Manufacturing has exhibited uneven growth in April-July, with industrial activity slowing sequentially in July, although it has been in expansionary mode for the ninth month in succession. Industries such as apparel, furniture and motor vehicles have experienced acceleration. Furthermore, the resumption of growth in production of consumer durables in recent months, after a protracted period of contraction over the last two years, is indicative of some pick-up in consumption demand, primarily in urban areas. Since our last review, however, external demand conditions have turned weaker, suggesting a more persistent drag from lower exports and cheaper imports due to global overcapacity. This contributes to continuing domestic capacity under-utilisation, decelerating new orders and a rising ratio of finished goods inventories to sales.As a result of still tepid aggregate demand, output price growth is weak, but input material costs have fallen further, leading to an increase in margins for most producers. Weak aggregate demand appears to have more than offset the effect of higher margins to hold back new investment intentions. The expansion in capital goods production, therefore, likely relates more to the revival of stalled projects than to a build-up of the green field pipeline. Survey-based business sentiment has been falling in recent quarters. The manufacturing purchasing managers¡¯ index (PMI) nevertheless remained in expansion territory in August, although it slowed from July due to weak domestic and export order books."

Typhoon,"On 24 September, Tropical Storm Nesat located 1,030 km East Northeast of Virac, Catanduanes entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility and maintained its course and strength as it moved closer to the Isabela-Aurora area. The storm intensified into a typhoon with local name “Pedring” and made landfall over the boundary of Aurora and Isabela on 27 September. On 28 September, the typhoon moved out of the country, but before that brought strong winds and rainfall, which toppled communication and power lines, trees, houses and others structures. The heavy rainfall also caused landslides and massive flooding.
Subsequently, another typhoon named “Quiel” intensified and entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility on 29 September 2011. With a maximum sustained winds of 140kph near the center with gustiness of up to 170kph, it has increased its threat to Northern Luzon. Severe Weather warnings and public storm signals have been issued to at least 13 provinces in Regions I and II. These are the same areas heavily devastated by Typhoon Nesat."
drought,"A historic drought in Chennai, the sixth-largest city in India, is so severe that it’s now visible from space.
The city’s 4.6 million citizens are rationing every drop of water, restaurants are closing early and companies are scaling back their operations as Chennai tries to survive a heat wave with 99 per cent less water than it had at the same time last year. The state government is shipping in water on trucks, but those trucks can’t replace the now dried-up lakes that once fed the city.
Everyone is asking the same question: When will the monsoons start?
Satellite footage released earlier this month shows the city’s four reservoirs, including nearby Lake Puzhal, have severely shrunk since last June. The reservoirs have a capacity of 318.8 billion litres, but they are down to a collective 651 million litres, according to government data reported by the Hindustan Times. The reservoirs have been reduced to 0.2 per cent of their capacity, according to state government data.
The city typically relies on the heavy rainfall of monsoon season to replenish its water supply, which comes from four lakes and groundwater reservoirs in the region. The monsoons usually start in June but they’ve been delayed this year, leaving citizens with little water amid blistering temperatures that exceed 40 C each day.
The problem dates back to last year, when Chennai saw a major shortfall in its monthly rainfall. The city received 80 per cent less rain than average in December alone, according to India’s weather office.
Temperatures in Chennai typically peak in May and June, around the same time that rainfall starts picking up. February, March and April are typically drought season, while the heaviest monsoon rains come in October, November and December.
The city has struggled to meet its water needs for the last few years. A government think tank warned last year that Chennai is one of 21 Indian cities that could run out of groundwater by 2020."
other,"Consumer price inflation rose sharply in Q3:2017-18, driven up by a spike in food prices and by the disbursement of enhanced house rent allowance (HRA) for central government employees, the latter alone contributing an estimated 35 basis points. It moderated somewhat in Q4 on a delayed seasonal easing of prices of vegetables. Industrial input costs increased through H2:2017-18, tracking movements in international commodity prices. Wage pressures have remained moderate in both the organised and rural sectors.The course of consumer price index (CPI) inflation in Q3 was significantly influenced by house rent allowance (HRA) increase for central government employees from July 2017, following the recommendations of the 7th central pay commission (CPC).1 The HRA impact contributed 35 basis points to the rise in headline inflation to its recent peak of 5.2 per cent in December, following the chain base method of compilation of the housing index in the CPI.2 Adjusted for the estimated HRA impact, headline inflation was 4.9 per cent in December. The HRA impact on inflation excluding food and fuel was even larger at around 75 basis points, adjusting for which it would have been lower at 4.4 per cent in December. Food inflation rose sharply in Q3 pushed by the unseasonal pick-up in prices of vegetables; and fuel inflation accelerated due to an uptick in inflation in liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), kerosene, coke and electricity. In Q4, headline inflation eased to 4.4 per cent by February 2018 with the seasonal softening in prices of vegetables. Excluding the HRA impact, headline inflation was 4.1 per cent and inflation excluding food and fuel remained unchanged at 4.4 per cent (Chart II.1).The MPR of October 2017 had projected CPI inflation to increase to 4.2 per cent in Q3 of 2017-18 and further to 4.6 per cent in Q4, based on a prognosis of unfavourable base effects and the play-out of the increase in HRA for central government employees. Actual inflation outcomes in Q3 were in alignment with the direction of the projected trajectory, but in levels, they turned out to be 35 basis points higher than forecast due to a combination of shocks. First, an unseasonal spike in the prices of onions and tomatoes during October-November 2017 caused prices of vegetables to soar, propelling inflation in this category to close to 30 per cent in December. Second, fuel inflation rose sharply during October-November on the back of an escalation in LPG prices. Third, international crude oil prices started firming up further from October. By end-December 2017, they were US$ 10 per barrel above the baseline assumption of US$ 55 per barrel. The pass-through to CPI inflation was, however, muted in Q3 due to excise duty cuts in early October and lagged mark-ups by oil marketing companies (OMCs). In Q4, most of the factors imposing these upward price pressures reversed. The winter downturn in prices of vegetables accentuated in January. Domestic LPG prices also eased in February, tracking international prices. As a result, the deviation between the actual and the projected inflation narrowed in Q4 to 15 bps (Chart II.2)."
other,"They were golf's band of brothers. ""The Golden Bear,"" ""The King"" and ""The Black Knight"" shared 34 major wins between them and irrevocably changed the sport they played.
Through a combination of Arnold Palmer's ""swashbuckling"" style of play, Gary Player's sheer willpower and Jack Nicklaus' utter brilliance, this triumvirate of golf greats catapulted the game into the modern era.
If the trio came to redefine how golf was played between the late 1950s and the early 1980s, unusually for sporting rivals, they also formed lasting relationships along the way -- so much so that the wives of Nicklaus and Palmer were best friends too.
""We were a big three in friendship, like brothers,"" the 85-year-old Player told CNN's Living Golf. ""We traveled to China, we'd travel to South Africa, all over Europe.
""We went all over the world, Australia, everywhere together. And we basically lived together, playing a lot of television matches and exhibitions together.""
Player remembers having a confrontation with Palmer on one of his courses, but the ""affection"" they had for each other made it easier to reconcile.
""We went in and we had lunch together and I can vividly remember, we were both crying because I think we had such affection for each other that we didn't want it to have an effect on our friendship. And so we laughed together as well as crying together."""

other,"Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday threatened to invoke executive privilege in an effort to block the House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol riot from obtaining a massive tranche of documents it's demanding from several US government agencies, despite his successor having the ultimate say over whether the information can be shared.
""Executive privilege will be defended, not just on behalf of my Administration and the Patriots who worked beside me, but on behalf of the Office of the President of the United States and the future of our Nation,"" Trump said in a statement, without detailing how such an effort would be conducted.
The Biden administration has already declined to assert executive privilege over some testimony related to January 6, telling former Justice Department officials that they were free to provide ""unrestricted testimony."" But the administration has not weighed in on whether the committee should have unrestricted access to records and documents from the Trump White House.
The document requests from the House select committee echo those previously issued by other House committees in the aftermath of the January 6 riot, while significantly broadening the search to other areas and people inside and outside government. Specifically, the select committee is asking for records from the Department of Justice, Department of the Interior, Department of Defense, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the National Counterterrorism Center, the Department of Homeland Security and, perhaps most importantly, the National Archives -- the custodian of the Trump administration White House records.
The list of targets is long and varied, ranging from information about attempts to either carry out or defy Trump's orders, invoke the insurrection act, martial law or the 25th Amendment, as well as for communications regarding members of the Trump White House, campaign, January 5 and January 6 rally organizers, and even alleged members of far-right extremist groups such as the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers.
""The Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol is examining the facts, circumstances, and causes of the January 6th attack. Our Constitution provides for a peaceful transfer of power, and this investigation seeks to evaluate threats to that process, identify lessons learned and recommend laws, policies, procedures, rules, or regulations necessary to protect our republic in the future,"" committee Chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi, wrote in a statement Wednesday."
wildfires,"Powerful winds pushed flames through Southern California canyons early Thursday as an out-of-control wildfire burned near homes and forced residents to flee.
The blaze in Orange County’s Silverado Canyon began late Wednesday as a house fire that quickly spread to tinder-dry brush as gusts topped 70 mph (113 kph).
It exploded in size throughout the night and as the sun came up, an enormous plume of smoke was visible for miles.
Firefighters struggled in steep terrain amid unpredictable Santa Ana winds that have raised fire danger for much of the region.
Orange County Fire Authority Captain Thanh Nguyen said crews were scrambling to stay ahead of flames that jumped major roads.
“We’ve seen the wind change also drastically, so that’s what we’re telling all our personnel to be aware of — that constantly changing wind,” he told CBS LA TV.
Evacuations were ordered for several canyon neighborhoods near the city of Lake Forest and residents of other nearby areas were told to be ready to get out. It was not immediately known how many people were affected or if any homes were damaged.
Numerous studies have linked bigger wildfires in America to climate change from the burning of coal, oil and gas. Scientists have said climate change has made California much drier, meaning trees and other plants are more flammable.
The Bond Fire about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of Los Angeles is burning near the same area of October’s Silverado Fire, which forced tens of thousands of people to evacuate.
The new blaze broke out as Southern California utilities cut the power to tens of thousands of customers to avoid the threat of wildfires during the notorious Santa Anas.
Red flag warnings of extreme fire danger through Saturday were in place because of low humidity, bone-dry brush and the winds, which sweep down from the interior, the National Weather Service said.
Utilities in the populous region began cutting power Wednesday to customers as a precaution to prevent gusts from blowing tree limbs into electrical equipment or knocking down power lines, which have sparked devastating wildfires in recent years.
Southern California Edison cut power to about 15,000 homes and businesses by late Wednesday night and was considering de-energizing lines serving about 271,000 customers in seven counties throughout the windy period, which could last into Saturday."
Typhoon,"Last night (August 10, 2013), Typhoon Utor intensified into a Super Typhoon with winds estimated around 130 knots, or roughly 150 miles per hour. It is pushing to the northwest into the Philippines today, and made landfall around 3 a.m. according to local clocks there on Monday, August 12, 2013. Heavy rain, flash flooding, storm surge over 20 to 30 feet, and damaging winds are likely for the Philippines as the storm bears down on the northern island of Luzon.
Super Typhoon Utor, also known as Typhoon Labuyo in the Philippines, has been going through an eye wall replacement cycle. These cycles typically occur when storms become intense. The eye wall is where the strongest winds are located in the system, and when it becomes so strong, the eye wall typically collapses and reorganizes into another eye wall. During this transition phase, the cyclone becomes slightly weaker. The latest imagery from the storm does not indicate a visible eye, which could be good news for the the island of Luzon. However, the impacts are still expected to cause major problems.
Once Super Typhoon Utor pushes through the Philippines, it is expected to weaken into Category 1 or 2 storm. It will continue to push to the northwest and later impact parts of southeast China, and possibly skirting just to the south and west of Hong Kong. Forecasting the intensity of a tropical cyclone can be difficult, meaning everyone across the region should pay close attention to this typhoon over the next several days. However, it looks like there is potential for the storm to intensify after it pushes over the Philippines and emerges back over warm waters."
wildfires,"Several small fires have sparked in the Payette National Forest in the last few days, according to forest service officials.
Meanwhile, a handful of other major fires continue to burn in west-central Idaho in parts of the Salmon-Challis National Forest, along with the Franch Church River of No Return Wilderness.
Firefighters report two fires in the Krassel Ranger District have burned about one-quarter of an acre each over the weekend. The Day Off Fire is located 3 miles east of Krassel Work Station. The Rainbow Fire is 5 miles northeast of Yellowpine. Both are expected to be contained by Sunday.
The quarter-acre Blue Fire started east of the Snake River near Council and has been contained.

valcano eruption,"See how the White Island volcano disaster unfolded when tourists entered White Island, they walked into a crater that could erupt at any time. Here is a 360-degree look at the volatile volcano. According to New Zealand’s official earthquake monitoring body, GeoNet, explosive eruptions can happen with little or no warning. They eject cannonball-like hot rocks, ash clouds and surges of boiling gases and rock projectiles into the air. This is what happened on Monday. For the 47 tourists on the island, the impact was immediate and devastating."
Typhoon,"A typhoon that slammed in eastern China's coast Wednesday flooded and washed out roads, knocked out power and disrupted transportation in one of the nation's most populous regions.
Damage to roads and bridges stranded hundreds of people though no casualties were immediately reported, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
Typhoon Haikui came ashore in Zhejiang province with winds up to 150 kilometres per hour early Wednesday and was weakening.
Shanghai Public Weather Service said Haikui dumped as much as 58 millimetres in one hour in the city's centre in the afternoon.
In Zhejiang, 12 townships lost power. Flooding left at least 130 people stranded in three hotels in Lin'an city after roads were washed out. In Anji county, about 300 tourists were trapped after a bridge was destroyed, Xinhua said.
The China Meteorological Administration had issued a red alert for Typhoon Haikui, the highest alert so far this year. More than 1.8 million people were evacuated from parts of heavily populated Shanghai and neighbouring Zhejiang.
Shanghai, which has 23 million people and is the country's financial hub, banned many outdoor activities. It curtailed public transit, cancelled more than 500 flights, and halted at least 600 trains on Wednesday, local media said.
The city relocated 374,000 residents and Zhejiang evacuated more than 1.5 million people, Xinhua said.
China is still recovering from typhoons Damrey and Saola, which hit over the weekend and caused at least 23 deaths. Saola also battered Taiwan and the Philippines and was blamed for about 60 deaths in the two countries."
wildfires,"In the wake of the enormous fires that have razed huge swathes of drought-stricken Australia, scientists fear that when rains eventually fall, they will wash charred debris into rivers, dams, and the ocean, killing wildlife and even tainting the drinking supplies of major cities, such as Sydney.
For many weeks, ash, soot, and blackened gum tree leaves have collected along the shorelines of Sydney’s beaches, clogging the waves and lapping in the tide. Originating in fires blazing in forested areas to the west, the debris has been carried on the breeze along with the pungent bushfire smoke that blanketed Australia’s largest city for much of December.
But what has carried on the wind is just a taste of the huge quantities of debris that are likely to wash into rivers once there are heavy downpours. As of press time, more than 26 million acres—an area bigger than Portugal—have now burned, mostly in the continent’s southeast. That includes areas of land known as catchments—also called watersheds—where rainfall begins its earthly journey into specific rivers, lakes, and dams.
It is an ecological disaster unprecedented in Australia’s history, and that spells trouble for drinking water supplies, coastal ecosystems, and the freshwater rivers that support iconic Australian wildlife, such as the platypus. (Australia's flying foxes are already dying en mass due to the extreme heat.)
“Disturbance on this scale is almost certainly going to impact biodiversity. I’m remarkably worried about the effects on freshwater ecosystems,” says Ross Thompson, a freshwater ecologist at the University of Canberra."

Hawk donated his blood as part of a collaboration with water company Liquid Death to produce 100 skateboards -- and they've already sold out.
""Yes, there is actually @tonyhawk's real blood in these skateboards. And yes, we sterilized it first. Own your very own piece of the Birdman today,"" reads a social media post from Liquid Death Tuesday.
""Although it could arguably make the world a better place, never ever use these boards to make clones of Tony Hawk.”
The accompanying video shows Hawk, who is a brand ambassador for Liquid Death, having a vial of blood removed which is then mixed with a tin of red paint used to make the boards.
Hawk also posted about the collaboration on his Instagram account.
""Always read the fine print! Thanks @liquiddeath for this rare opportunity but please be careful with my life force,"" he wrote.
""Looking forward to our future 'collaborations' as long as they don't involve replicants."""
valcano eruption,"Natural Disaster Alert: Volcanic Eruption in St. Vincent _ U.S. Embassy Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean Event: St. Vincent’s National Emergency Management Organization (NEMO) confirmed several eruptions at the La Soufriere volcano with ash plumes up to 20,000 feet on April 9. The ash cloud is moving east from St. Vincent with ash fall reported as far southeast as Argyle International Airport, which is located approximately 12 miles away. Heavy ash fall with poor visibility is reported in the evacuation zone, and the Seismic Research Center at the University of the West Indies (UWI) reports the ash column is falling back down around the volcano and surrounding area. Communities across mainland St. Vincent will experience varying degrees of ashfall. The Grenadines may also be affected. Mandatory evacuation for all residents in the red zone continues. Air operations at Argyle International Airport are currently suspended. The UWI Seismic Research Center reports that ashfall may also be experienced in Barbados and St. Lucia."
other,"Global financial markets have been driven mainly by rising policy rates in the US, volatile crude oil prices and expectations of a slowdown compared with earlier projections. Among AEs, equity markets in the US witnessed a selloff on the weakening outlook for corporate earnings caused by rising borrowing costs, while the European stock markets declined on political uncertainties. The Japanese stock market also shed gains on global cues and the gradual strengthening of the yen. EM stock markets have corrected on shrinking global liquidity, weak economic data in some key EMEs, and lingering trade tensions. The 10-year yield in the US, which surged on robust economic data at the beginning of October, softened subsequently on the unchanged Fed stance. Among other AEs, bond yields in the Euro area and Japan softened on weak economic sentiment and idiosyncratic factors. In most EMEs, bond yields have softened in recent weeks on falling crude oil prices and steadying currencies. In currency markets, the US dollar, which was strengthening on a widening growth differential with its peers, eased in the second half of November. The euro has weakened on Brexit and budget concerns in Italy, while the yen appreciated on safe haven buying in November. EME currencies have been trading with an appreciating bias, supported by a sharp decline in crude oil prices and conservative domestic monetary policy stances.On the domestic front, gross domestic product (GDP) growth slowed down to 7.1 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) in Q2:2018-19, after four consecutive quarters of acceleration, weighed down by moderation in private consumption and a large drag from net exports. Private consumption slowed down possibly on account of moderation in rural demand, subdued growth in kharif output, depressed prices of agricultural commodities and sluggish growth in rural wages. However, growth in government final consumption expenditure (GFCE) strengthened, buoyed by higher spending by the central government. Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) expanded by double-digits for the third consecutive quarter, driven mainly by the public sector¡¯s thrust on national highways and rural infrastructure, which was also reflected in robust growth in cement production and steel consumption. Growth of imports accelerated at a much faster pace than that of exports, resulting in net exports pulling down aggregate demand."
earthquake,"Powerful 7.7 earthquake strikes in Caribbean between Cuba and Jamaica A magnitude 7.7 earthquake in the Caribbean Sea, followed by a series of strong aftershocks, shook a large stretch from Florida to Mexico on Tuesday but apparently caused no major damage or casualties.  The initial tremor struck at 2:10 p.m. Eastern Time and was centered 86 miles northwest of Montego Bay, Jamaica, and 87 miles west-southwest of Niquero, Cuba, the U.S. Geological Survey said. The quake's depth was relatively shallow at 6 miles beneath the surface. The USGS initially estimated the quake's magnitude at 7.3 before upgrading it to 7.7. The ensuing aftershocks so far have topped out at a magnitude 6.1. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said any tsunami threats from the earthquake have passed and no other ones are foreseen. There have been no immediate reports of damage or injuries. However, the earthquake caused very strong to severe shaking in portions of far western Jamaica, capable of moderate to heavy damage, the USGS said. It also said moderate shaking was felt on Grand Cayman Island, while light shaking was reported on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. Other affected countries include the Bahamas, Haiti and Honduras. Gov. Carlos Joaquín González of Mexico’s Quintana Roo, which is home to Cancun, Tulum and other popular Caribbean beach resorts, said the earthquake was felt in multiple parts of the state. In total, five states in Mexico felt the tremor, the country's seismological service reported. The quake was also felt as far away as South Florida, and buildings in Miami were evacuated as a precaution. Stenette Davis, a psychiatrist at a Cayman Islands hospital, said she saw manhole covers blown off by the force of the quake, and sewage exploding into the street, but no more serious damage."
earthquake,"A magnitude 6.1 earthquake shook Alaska's Talkeetna Mountains north of Anchorage Sunday night and smaller tremors continued early Monday.
The earthquake was felt from Homer to Fairbanks, and was felt especially strongly in the Anchorage and Wasilla areas, the Anchorage Daily News reported. Some people described items falling off shelves and many described rolling motion.
There were no immediate reports of injuries or major damage.
The Alaska Earthquake Center reported the quake had a depth of about 27 miles (44 kilometers). Its epicenter was about 60 miles (96 kilometers) east of Talkeetna, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) northeast of Anchorage.
A magnitude 4.6 aftershock struck at about 4:14 a.m. Monday and about a dozen small quakes measuring 3.0 or smaller continue to rattle the area.
It was the largest earthquake to strike southcentral Alaska since the magnitude 7.1 quake in November 2018, the Alaska News Source reported. That quake caused major infrastructure damage across Anchorage, with damage to many homes and buildings and closures for roads and bridges. There were no reports of deaths.
There have been more than a dozen similarly sized, or larger quakes that have struck the Aleutians since the 2018 temblor."
drought,"Drought conditions are expected to persist in Barbados into the first seven months of 2020, with 2019 being the driest year on record in some 70 years. The Barbados Meteorological Services at the Grantley Adams International Airport recorded 736.5 mm (29 inches) of rainfall-- the lowest since 1942, while the Caribbean Institute of Meteorology and Hydrology (CIMH) at Husbands, St. James recorded 804.5 mm (31.7 inches)-- the lowest since 1969.
CIMH advised authorities to carry out measures to alleviate fallout from a dry period which is expected to last possibly to the end of September 2020. 
Following the revelation of low figures during a press conference at CIMH's headquarters, general manager of the Barbados Water Authority Keithroy Halliday and Acting Chief Agricultural Officer Charleston Lucas affirmed that programs have begun to deal with the crisis ahead. The dry season usually starts in May.
The Barbados Meteorological Services recorded 736.5 mm (29 inches)-- 58 percent of average yearly rain and lowest in 77 years, while CIMH recorded 804.5 mm (31.7 inches)-- 63 percent of average conditions and lowest in 50 years. Prior to 2019's record, the driest year was 1947.
According to CIMH’s chief of Applied Meteorology and Climatology Adrian Trotman, last year's exceptionally dry conditions followed on from the same situation between 2014 to 2016 but worsened in 2019 particularly in the last six months.
In addition, Climatologist Dr. Cedric Van Meerbeeck said that although February to April is often the driest months, the impact from 2019's drought will be felt more significantly during this time.
""Having been in this drought for so long, what we expect is that the impact on the ground is going to slowly start increasing. So you are talking about plants withering and also about fire risk increasing, and about crop yields being affected at some stage,"" he noted, adding that models indicate it is going to be ""very dry.""
Van Meerbeeck also said that the situation may be aggravated with a probable late start to the wet season.
""We need to make sure that we monitor our resources and we need to make sure that we conserve as much as possible because by the end of May we will expect to see quite an impact on our water levels."""
wildfires,"Alaska, the great northern frontier of America, is being reshaped by climate change. While rising temperatures are altering its character and landscape, they are also bringing the ravages of wildfires.
In the past 60 years, Alaska has warmed more than twice as fast as the rest of the country, with average temperatures up by nearly 3°F. By 2050, temperatures are projected to climb an additional 2-4 degrees, with the Arctic region seeing the most dramatic increases. These rising temperatures are expected to increase wildfire risks in Alaska, just as they have in the rest of the western U.S.Wildfires have been on the rise across the western U.S. since the 1970s, at the same time that spring and summer temperatures have increased dramatically, and average spring snowpack has declined substantially.
Fires in Alaska don’t often make news in the lower 48, but they threaten vast expanses of forest, parkland, and tundra that store immense quantities of carbon. The state’s growing number of large wildfires have the potential to damage these ecosystems, and the people and wildlife that depend on them, while releasing a significant amount of carbon into the atmosphere, further contributing to global warming. Wildfire emissions over these vast areas also threaten air quality in Alaska and beyond."
drought,"The severe drought affecting parts of Nova Scotia may be causing more trouble than it would elsewhere in Canada because Nova Scotians aren't used to drought conditions.  
For more than a month now, people in the southwest have reported dry wells and throughout the province, rivers and lakes are low. Local governments have offered drinking water and places to bathe while ecologists are worried about fish and other species.
The severe drought, as it's classified, is unusual in this part of Canada said agriclimate specialist Trevor Hadwen. He said generally these types of dry conditions happen a lot more frequently and more severely in other parts of the country.
Hadwen leads the Canadian Drought Monitor, Agriculture Canada's contribution to a continent wide tracking program of drought conditions.
Right now, his program is watching Nova Scotia's struggles carefully. It's one of three provinces experiencing a drought, the others are Ontario and British Columbia, he said.
""Typically in the prairie region, farmers and residents in rural areas are used to dealing with these circumstances, so they prepare for it,"" Hadwen said.
""In situations where we have drought in Atlantic Canada, there aren't the same systems in place and people aren't as familiar with managing through drought situations, so the impacts can be fairly severe."""
drought,"Millions of people in the Horn of Africa are facing severe shortages of food as the worst drought in the region for six decades withers crops and kills livestock, as the BBC's world affairs correspondent Mike Wooldridge reports.
""I had a herd of 200 cows. I took them to Ethiopia when the drought started. All the cows I had taken there died and I came back without a single cow.""
That story told by a resident of Wajir district in northern Kenya might not immediately appear to symbolise the humanitarian emergency increasingly gripping swathes of East Africa and the Horn of Africa - in the way that the rapidly growing number of acutely malnourished children trekking out of Somalia does.
But the distress being experienced by pastoralist communities across the affected region also goes a long way in explaining the severity of the current drought, its impact and the limits to the strategies people use to try to protect their livelihoods in such circumstances.
The Wajir cattle herder acted when he saw the grazing for his precious animals drying up.
But in the area of Ethiopia he took them to there turned out to be no greater chance of saving them. They started dropping dead, he says, one by one.
Aid officials estimate that up to half a million cattle have been lost in Ethiopia this year.
It often takes pastoralists at least two years to recover from a severe drought, particularly where it means building up a milking herd again.
This year's drought has hit hard when many people have not yet recovered from the last serious drought in 2009.
And the more marginalised the communities - and many of them are - the more likely people are to be pushed over the edge."

The National Hurricane Center in Miami said Delta came ashore Friday evening in southwest Louisiana as a Category 2 hurricane but quickly weakened and has become a tropical storm as it moves inland.
The storm is moving to the north-northeast on a track across central and north Louisiana that is expected to continue through Saturday morning, forecasters said.
The National Hurricane Center in Miami said Delta came ashore Friday evening in southwest Louisiana as a Category 2 hurricane but quickly weakened and has become a tropical storm as it moves inland.
The storm is moving to the north-northeast on a track across central and north Louisiana that is expected to continue through Saturday morning, forecasters said.
The system is expected to become a tropical depression by later Saturday as it moves across northern Mississippi into the Tennessee Valley.
THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE: AP’s earlier story appears below.
Ripping tarps from already damaged roofs and scattering debris piled by roadsides, Hurricane Delta inflicted a new round of destruction on Louisiana as it struck communities still reeling after Hurricane Laura took a similar path just six weeks earlier.
Delta hit as a Category 2 hurricane, with top winds of 100 mph (155 kph) but rapidly grew weaker. It dwindled within hours to a weak Category 1 storm with 75 mph (120 kph) winds. Still, forecasters warned of danger from storm surge and flash floods across much of southwestern Louisiana and parts of neighboring Texas.
Delta made landfall Friday evening near the coastal town of Creole — a distance of only about 15 miles (24 kilometers) from where Laura struck land in August, killing 27 people in Louisiana. The earlier storm damaged nearly every home and building in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Piles of moldy mattresses, sawed-up trees and other debris still lined the streets.
Mayor Nic Hunter said tarps were flying off homes across the city.
“I’m in a building right now with a tarp on it and just the sound of the tarp flapping on the building sounds like someone pounding with a sledgehammer on top of the building,“ Hunter said as he rode out the storm downtown. ”It’s pretty intense.”
In Lake Charles, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland from where Delta came ashore, water leaked through the ceiling of Ernest Jack's bedroom as he tried to sleep Friday night. Jack said the tarp cover the roof damage caused by Laura hadn’t blown off. His windows were covered to protect against flying debris.
“It’s raining real hard; it’s flooding; the wind is strong,” Jack said Friday night. “I’m OK. I’m not worried about nothing, just praying that everything goes well.”"

Tropical storm warnings were in effect from the New Jersey coast through Long Island and Connecticut, with tropical storm force winds expected there within the next 36 hours.  In North Carolina, a high rip current risk is still in place for the Outer Banks for the weekend, but all other threats are diminishing. Tropical Storm Fay didn't stick around very long when it formed Thursday evening off the coast of North Carolina. Some strong surf and choppy waves were seen up and down the Outer Banks area on Thursday, particularly in Nags Head. It made for an interesting day for tourists. At the same time, it worried some business owners, who were on a little bit of an edge as they try to bounce back in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Fay's behavior was well received, mostly. Visitors trying to catch a break from COVID-19 and everything else in the world didn’t let Tropical Storm Fay ruin their trip Thursday to the Outer Banks. Most took a cue from mother nature and went with the flow."

earthquake,"7.7 magnitude earthquake hits between Cuba and Jamaica HAVANA — A powerful magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck in the Caribbean Sea between Jamaica and eastern Cuba on Tuesday. Witnesses reported strong shaking but there was no immediate word of casualties or heavy damage. The quake was centered 86 miles northwest of Montego Bay, Jamaica, and 87 miles west-southwest of Niquero, Cuba. It hit at 2:10 p.m. and the epicenter was a relatively shallow 6 miles beneath the surface. The quake could be felt strongly in Santiago, the largest city in eastern Cuba, said Belkis Guerrero, who works in a Catholic cultural center in the center of Santiago “We were all sitting and we felt the chairs move,” she said. “We heard the noise of everything moving around.” She said there was no apparent damage in the heart of the colonial city. “It felt very strong but it doesn’t look like anything happened,” she told The Associated Press. The quake also hit the Cayman Islands, leaving cracked roads and what appeared to be sewage spilling from cracked mains. There were no immediate reports of deaths, injuries or more severe damage, said Kevin Morales, editor-in-chief of the Cayman Compass newspaper. The islands see so few earthquakes that newsroom staff were puzzled when it hit, he said. “‘It was just like a big dump truck was rolling past,”‘ Morales said. “Then it continued and got more intense.”"
earthquake,"7.7-magnitude earthquake generates small South Pacific tsunami NOUMEA: A 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck in the South Pacific on Thursday (Feb 11), generating a small tsunami that caused no damage to island nations in the region before authorities gave the all clear. The quake struck at just after midnight on Thursday local time (9.20pm on Wednesday, Singapore time) about 415 kilometres east of Vao in New Caledonia at a depth of 10 kilometres, according to the US Geological Survey. The US government's NWS Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said ""hazardous tsunami waves"" were forecast for some coasts. It said waves reaching between 0.3 and one metre above the tide level were possible for Fiji, New Zealand and Vanuatu. A wave of 0.3 metres struck Fiji, according to the Twitter feed of the island nation's seismology department. However, Fiji Seismology later cancelled its tsunami warning. ""The seismology observatory upon its assessments has now verified and confirmed the cancellation of the warning and 'all clear information' (is) issued to the whole Fiji group,"" it said. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology confirmed in a tweet that a tsunami had been generated. The bureau warned of a threat to Lord Howe Island, which is about 550 kilometres east of Australia's mainland, but said there was no need for evacuations. Locals in the Vanuatu capital Port Vila said they felt the quake but there was no damage from either the shake or subsequent waves. The New Zealand National Emergency Management Agency warned of ""strong and unusual currents"" in northern coastal areas but said there was no tsunami risk. ""There isn't a threat to land so we haven't issued a tsunami alert,"" the disaster agency's acting director Roger Ball told Radio New Zealand. He advised those in affected areas to ""stay out of the water and stay off the beaches"" but said the danger posed was not enough to warrant a nationwide warning. ""Waking everybody up at 4:00 or 5:00 am in the morning with emergency mobile alerts we didn't feel was a proportionate response,"" he said. There were no initial reports of casualties or damage from the tsunami or the quake, which was initially recorded by USGS at magnitude 7.5 before being revised to 7.7. The Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", where tectonic plates collide, experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity. In 2018, a 7.5-magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami on Indonesia's Sulawesi island left more than 4,300 people dead or missing. A 9.1-magnitude quake struck off the coast of Indonesia's Sumatra island in 2004, triggering a tsunami that killed 220,000 throughout the region. The death toll included around 170,000 in Indonesia - one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history."

However, the concerned authorities there said that the jolt ws too deep to cause any damage to the public property or the routine life in the region. They also said that no tsunami warning has been issued. According to the US Geological Survey (USGS), the earthquake in Philippines was of 7.0 magnitude at the Richter Scale and was located 95.8 kilometers (60 miles) below the sea and about 210 kilometers (130 miles) southeast of Pondaguitan in Davao Occidental province. the USGS went on to add that any kind of damage to the public or casualty was highly unlikely. The US tsunami warning system said that there was no tsunami threat from the recent earthquake in the Philippines. As per the Philippine institute of volcanology and seismology, the earthquake was felt in the nearby region and province of Pondaguitan.

earthquake,"A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck off Japan's northeastern coast on Saturday, authorities said, but no tsunami warning was issued and there were no immediate reports of damage.
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) said the mid-morning quake hit at a depth of 47 kilometres (29 miles) in the Pacific, off Ishinomaki in Miyagi prefecture -- near the epicentre of a huge 2011 quake which triggered a towering tsunami, killing more than 18,000 people.
Japan's meteorological agency said there was no tsunami risk following Saturday's jolt, which produced strong shaking along parts of the eastern coast and was also felt in Tokyo.
""We are still collecting information but have not received any reports of injuries or damage,"" local government spokesman Tomoki Sawata told AFP, calling the quake ""fairly strong"".
Local railway firms suspended services, including of shinkansen bullet trains, public broadcaster NHK said, while elevators stopped in some buildings in Miyagi.
Fukushima nuclear plant operator TEPCO said the facility, which melted down in the wake of the 2011 tsunami, did not show any abnormalities after the latest jolt.

Japan sits on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", an arc of intense seismic activity that stretches through Southeast Asia and across the Pacific basin.
The country is regularly hit by quakes, and has strict construction regulations intended to ensure buildings can withstand strong tremors.
In March, a strong 7.2-magnitude earthquake struck off the northeastern coast. Japan's authorities issued a tsunami advisory but there was no damage on the coastline.
The region was also shaken by another strong quake in February that injured dozens. Meteorologists said it was an aftershock of the 2011 quake."

Typhoon,"A satellite map shows Typhoon Utor, which is referred to as Labuyo in the Philippines, at 2:32 p.m. local time Monday.
The world's strongest storm of the year so far plowed across the northern Philippines on Monday, killing at least one person and leaving 20 fishermen missing.
Packing winds as strong as 200 kilometers per hour (124 mph), Typhoon Utor made landfall early Monday on the east coast of the Philippine island of Luzon, damaging hundreds of houses.
""It's the strongest typhoon we've had so far on the planet this year,"" said CNN International meteorologist Samantha Mohr. ""So that gives you some idea of the magnitude of this system.""
Utor, known in the Philippines as Labuyo, churned west-northwest over Luzon, dumping heavy rain on the island's hilly terrain and bringing the risk of landslides. It weakened as it moved over land, and by Monday afternoon, it had begun to head out into the South China Sea.
Aid groups in the Philippines, which had been preparing for the storm's arrival for several days, said they were only just beginning to assess the situation on the ground in the hardest-hit areas.
""There's a high risk that part of the population may get isolated because of landslides and difficulty moving around,"" said Anna Lindenfors, country director for Save the Children in the Philippines.
The country's National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council reported one death in the province of Benguet on Monday afternoon.
Twenty fishermen who had headed out to sea before the storm's arrival remained unaccounted for, the agency said. But dozens of others who had initially been reported missing had returned home safely, it said.
The agency reported damage to 673 houses in the province of Aurora, where the storm made landfall.
The typhoon destroyed nearly 80% of the infrastructure in Casiguran, a town that lay in Utor's path across the province, CNN affiliate ABS-CBN reported.
The storm tore apart rickety houses and ripped the roof off a local hospital, the local broadcaster said, showing images of flattened homes buried under fallen trees.
Situated near an area of the Pacific Ocean where typhoons form, the Philippines regularly suffers severe storm damage.
An average of 20 typhoons hit the Southeast Asian country every year, and two or three of those cause serious damage, according to Plan International, an aid and development organization.
Utor is expected to pick up more strength over the warm waters of the South China Sea over the next day or so before making landfall on the southern coast of China on Wednesday."
drought,"As the fifth year of California’s drought grinds on much-needed rain will help lessen the economic damage on the agriculture industry, according to a new economic analysis released Monday.
“This year we still have a drought but it’s not nearly as bad as 2014 or 2015 for agriculture,” said Jay Lund, director of the UC Davis Center for Watershed Sciences and one of the authors of the analysis. “But the state isn’t out of the woods as a lack of rain in 2017 could put California back in bad shape.”
About 78,800 acres of farmland are projected to be idled this year due to the ongoing drought. That is a small number compared with the estimated 540,000 acres of fallowed land in 2015. Overall, the state’s agriculture industry represents around 9.3 million acres of irrigated crops.
“Almost all fallowed land due to drought is projected to be on the west side of the San Joaquin Basin, which relies heavily on water imports,” according to the UC Davis analysis. “No significant drought-related impacts are expected for livestock and dairies this year as this sector is more affected by market conditions than drought this year.”
The study predicts water shortages in 2016 will cost the ag industry a total of $550 million in direct costs and 1,815 in lost jobs. That compares with an estimated $1.8 billion in direct costs and 10,100 in jobs last year, the UC Davis researchers said.
When looking at the drought’s total impact, including from businesses supporting farming and the loss of household incomes, the ag region losses this year are forecast to top $600 million and 4,700 jobs statewide. Researchers put the total economic loss last year at roughly $2.7 billion and 21,000 jobs statewide.
“Water costs are coming down from the highs farmers paid a year ago,” said Lund.
Some farmers have seen water costs go up sharply, making growing certain crops unprofitable. During the drought, it hasn’t been unusual for farmers to see water costs of $1,000 per acre-foot and above — well above the cost of roughly $120 per acre-foot they were accustomed to before the drought. Higher-priced water has tended to go to permanent crops such as tree nuts, orchard fruits and wine grapes.
Researchers said surface water supply for crops was roughly 14 percent less than normal statewide. Groundwater was responsible for offsetting roughly 70 percent of the ag industry’s surface water deficit statewide, researchers said.
The analysts pointed out that there were substantial rains in the northern part of the state that required several reservoirs to spill water for flood control purposes. Areas south of California’s Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, where two of the state’s major riverways converge, have seen drier conditions.
The U.S. Drought Monitor released last Thursday showed 59 percent of California remains in severe drought conditions, down from about 88 percent at the start of the calendar year. About 21 percent of the state remains in exceptional drought, although that compares with nearly 45 percent at the start of the year."
Typhoon,"A super typhoon blew into the eastern Philippines with disastrous force Sunday, killing at least 10 people and triggering volcanic mudflows that engulfed about 150 houses before weakening as it blew away from the country, officials said.
Typhoon Goni blasted into the eastern island province of Catanduanes at dawn from the Pacific with sustained winds of 225 kilometers (140 miles) per hour and gusts of 280 kph (174 mph), threatening some provinces still recovering from a deadly typhoon that hit a week ago.
Goni barreled through densely populated regions and threatened to sideswipe Manila, which shut down its main airport, but shifted southward Sunday night and spared the capital, the government weather agency said.
At least nine people were killed in the hard-hit province of Albay, including a father and son. Villagers fled to safety as the typhoon approached, but the two apparently stayed put in the community in Guinobatan town where about 150 houses were inundated by volcanic mudflow.
“The child was found 15 kilometers (9 miles) away,” Albay Gov. Al Francis Bichara told DZMM radio, adding that the boy was swept away by mudflows and found in the next town.
He did not say whether there were any other residents trapped by the rampaging mudflows in the community and added that downed communications made it hard for people to communicate. The Office of Civil Defense reported that three Guinobatan residents were missing, but it was not immediately clear if they were from the mudflow-hit community.
The other deaths in Albay included a villager who was pinned by a fallen tree. One person was killed in Catanduanes province.

Ricardo Jalad, who heads the government’s disaster-response agency, had feared that the typhoon could wreak major damage due to its enormous force. The Philippine weather agency reinforced those concerns, saying that within 12 hours after the typhoon’s landfall, people could face “catastrophic, violent winds and intense to torrential rainfall.”
Residents were warned of possible landslides, massive flooding, storm surges of up to 5 meters (16 feet) and powerful winds that can blow away shanties. But after hitting a mountain range and repeatedly slamming into coastal provinces, the typhoon gradually weakened, although it remained potentially deadly as it blew out into the South China Sea, forecasters said.
One of the most powerful typhoons in the world this year, Goni evoked memories of Typhoon Haiyan, which left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million in the central Philippines in November 2013."
drought,"In some areas of Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia and Uganda, drought conditions are the worst in 60 years, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in an update.
Almost half the of children arriving in refugees camps in Ethiopia from southern Somalia are malnourished, while 11 districts in Kenya have reported malnutrition rates above the 15 per cent emergency threshold. Supplementary and therapeutic feeding programmes are struggling to keep pace with the rising needs, according to OCHA.
Drought-related displacement and refugee flows are on the rise, with an average of 15,000 Somalis arriving in Kenya and Ethiopia every month this year seeking assistance.
“While conflict has been a fact of life for them for years, it is the drought that has taken them to breaking point. Many have walked for days, are exhausted, in poor health, desperate for food and water, and arriving in a worse condition than usual,” according to the OCHA update on the drought situation in the region.
The influx of Somalis into refugee camps in the Dadaab area of Kenya’s North-Eastern province _ the largest refugee settlement in the world _ has led to worsening overcrowding amid limited resources.
The drought has forced children out of school as both human and livestock diseases spread. Competition for the meagre resources is causing tensions among communities.
The price of grain in drought-affected areas of Kenya is 30 to 80 per cent more than the five-year average, according to OCHA, while in Ethiopia, the consumer price index for food increased by almost 41 per cent last month. Further food price hikes area expected in Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda and Somalia, but could ease after the next harvests expected later this year.
OCHA called for the scaling up of the emergency response in all affected areas, urging governments, donors and relief agencies step up efforts to prevent further deterioration.
Further funding is also required to enable humanitarian agencies to provide the necessary assistance. UN agencies and the partners this year requested 529 million for Somalia, but only 50 per cent of that amount has been received.
In Kenya, where 525 million is required, about 54 per cent of that money has been obtained so far. The appeal for Djibouti is for 39 million, but only 30 per cent has been received."
earthquake,"South-east Victoria has been rocked by more than 40 aftershocks after a magnitude-5.4 earthquake hit near Moe in Gippsland on Tuesday night.
The tremor struck 16 kilometres west of Moe, but was felt in the centre of Melbourne and in suburbs across the city's west and south-east.
Initially measured at magnitude-5.3, it was also felt as far north as Shepparton and even Albury on the border with New South Wales.
The SES said it received dozens of calls for help for cracked walls and ceilings and a collapsed garage and chimney.
Residents and business owners are being urged to check their properties for damage before returning inside.
But the SES says there have been no reports of major damage.
Residents reported hearing a roaring noise as the quake hit just before 9:00pm at a depth of about 10km.
An SES spokesman told ABC News Breakfast there were 850 calls to emergency services in the first hour after the quake.
""The damage we've seen has largely been minor cracks in walls and a garage that has had some damage. We've also seen some shops that have had some stock come off the shelves,"" he said.
He said some homes did lose power after the quake but there have been no significant reports of gas leaks."
Typhoon,"Here’s an astonishing statistic: Typhoon Wipha dumped 33 inches (850 mm) of rain in 24 hours on Oshima Island, 75 miles south of Tokyo.
It is the greatest rainstorm to occur on Oshima, populated by 8,200 people, since records began in 1991 reports the AP. It also twice the entire average rainfall for the month of October, notes the Wall Street Journal.
Incredibly, 17 inches (426 mm) fell in 4 hours and nearly 5 inches in one hour.
Those are unfathomable rainfall rates and, thus, it is no surprise they led to destructive mudslides and fatalities.
At least 17 people are dead from the typhoon and 45 to 50 missing according to wire reports. 16 of the 17 casualties occurred on Oshima.
283 homes were damaged or destroyed on Oshima, the AP says.
“The storm sent large volumes of earth down mountainsides and caused rivers to burst their banks,” reports the BBC. “Television footage showed the remains of wooden homes buried in mud and covered in debris.”"
other,"We learned in a previous lesson that governments use fiscal policy to close output gaps. But central banks also have a tool to smooth the business cycle: monetary policy. Most central banks have a dual mandate to maintain stable prices and to promote full employment. Central banks use the money supply to meet these two objectives. When a central bank changes the money supply, it changes interest rates, and changes in interest rates impact investment and aggregate demand."
other,"Following the stabilization of economic activity in mid-2009, the U.S. economy is now in its seventh quarter of growth; last quarter, for the first time in this expansion, our nation's real gross domestic product (GDP) matched its pre-crisis peak. Nevertheless, job growth remains relatively weak and the unemployment rate is still high.In its early stages, the economic recovery was largely attributable to the stabilization of the financial system, the effects of expansionary monetary and fiscal policies, and a strong boost to production from businesses rebuilding their depleted inventories. Economic growth slowed significantly in the spring and early summer of 2010, as the impetus from inventory building and fiscal stimulus diminished and as Europe's debt problems roiled global financial markets. More recently, however, we have seen increased evidence that a self-sustaining recovery in consumer and business spending may be taking hold. Notably, real consumer spending has grown at a solid pace since last fall, and business investment in new equipment and software has continued to expand. Stronger demand, both domestic and foreign, has supported steady gains in U.S. manufacturing output.The combination of rising household and business confidence, accommodative monetary policy, and improving credit conditions seems likely to lead to a somewhat more rapid pace of economic recovery in 2011 than we saw last year. The most recent economic projections by Federal Reserve Board members and Reserve Bank presidents, prepared in conjunction with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in late January, are for real GDP to increase 3-1/2 to 4 percent in 2011, about one-half percentage point higher than our projections made in November.1 Private forecasters' projections for 2011 are broadly consistent with those of the FOMC participants and have also moved up in recent months."
earthquake,"The biggest earthquake to hit Japan in 140 years struck the northeast coast on Friday, triggering a 10-meter tsunami that swept away everything in its path, including houses, cars and farm buildings on fire, media and witnesses said.
At least one person was killed in Fukushima prefecture, north of Tokyo where four million homes were without power. The 8.9 magnitude quake caused many injuries, public broadcaster NHK said, sparked fires and the wall of water, prompting warnings to people to move to higher ground in coastal areas.
The Philippines, Taiwan and Indonesia all issued tsunami alerts, reviving memories of the giant tsunami which struck Asia in 2004. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued alerts for countries as far away as Colombia and Peru.
There were several strong aftershocks. In the capital Tokyo, buildings shook violently. An oil refinery near Tokyo was on fire, with dozens of storage tanks under threat."
other,"In the second bi-monthly resolution of 2018-19, CPI inflation for 2018-19 was projected at 4.8-4.9 per cent in H1 and 4.7 per cent in H2, including the HRA impact for central government employees, with risks tilted to the upside. Excluding the impact of HRA revisions, CPI inflation was projected at 4.6 per cent in H1 and 4.7 per cent in H2. Actual inflation outcomes have been slightly below the projected trajectory as the seasonal summer surge in vegetable prices has remained somewhat muted in comparison with its past behaviour and fruits prices have declined.The inflation outlook is likely to be shaped by several factors. First, the central government has decided to fix the minimum support prices (MSPs) of at least 150 per cent of the cost of production for all kharif crops for the sowing season of 2018-19. This increase in MSPs for kharif crops, which is much larger than the average increase seen in the past few years, will have a direct impact on food inflation and second round effects on headline inflation. A part of the increase in MSPs based on historical trends was already included in the June baseline projections. As such, only the incremental increase in MSPs over the average increase in the past will impact inflation projections. However, there is a considerable uncertainty and the exact impact would depend on the nature and scale of the government¡¯s procurement operations. Second, the overall performance of the monsoon so far augurs well for food inflation in the medium-term. Third, crude oil prices have moderated slightly, but remain at elevated levels. Fourth, the central government has reduced Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates on several goods and services. This will have some direct moderating impact on inflation, provided there is a pass-through of reduced GST rates to retail consumers. Fifth, inflation in items excluding food and fuel has been broad-based and has risen significantly in recent months, reflecting greater pass-through of rising input costs and improving demand conditions. Finally, financial markets continue to be volatile. Based on an assessment of the above-mentioned factors, inflation is projected at 4.6 per cent in Q2, 4.8 per cent in H2 of 2018-19 and 5.0 per cent in Q1:2019-20, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 1). Excluding the HRA impact, CPI inflation is projected at 4.4 per cent in Q2, 4.7-4.8 per cent in H2 and 5.0 per cent in Q1:2019-20.Turning to the growth outlook, various indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to be strong. The progress of the monsoon so far and a sharper than the usual increase in MSPs of kharif crops are expected to boost rural demand by raising farmers¡¯ income. Robust corporate earnings, especially of fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies, also reflect buoyant rural demand. Investment activity remains firm even as there has been some tightening of financing conditions in the recent period. Increased FDI flows in recent months and continued buoyant domestic capital market conditions bode well for investment activity. The Reserve Bank¡¯s IOS indicates that activity in the manufacturing sector is expected to remain robust in Q2, though there may be some moderation in pace. Rising trade tensions may, however, have an adverse impact on India¡¯s exports. Based on an overall assessment, GDP growth projection for 2018-19 is retained, as in the June statement, at 7.4 per cent, ranging 7.5-7.6 per cent in H1 and 7.3-7.4 per cent in H2, with risks evenly balanced; GDP growth for Q1:2019-20 is projected at 7.5 per cent (Chart 2)."
wildfires,"Some people who had fled their homes have now been able to return, although others spent the night in emergency evacuation centres or with relatives.
A 78-year-old man was found dead and five others were hurt, two seriously, in the fires.
Thousands of people were evacuated, including some 300 British expats.
The UK Consulate in Malaga said they had all now left the evacuation centre and were staying with friends or had returned to their homes.
The authorities say the cause of the fires will be investigated, and are not ruling out that they could have been started deliberately.
Hundreds of firefighters, backed up by emergency military personnel and 31 planes and helicopters, continue to battle a huge blaze near Marbella, famous for its up-market hotels and villas and a favourite haunt of wealthy foreigners.
Spanish media reported that the fires had been brought under control, but fire service officials told the BBC that some pockets were still causing problems."
valcano eruption,"Volcanic Eruption, Ensuing Chaos Kill At Least 15 in Congo Goma, Congo (AP) -- Torrents of lava poured into villages after dark in eastern Congo with little warning, leaving at least 15 people dead amid the chaos and destroying more than 500 homes, officials and survivors said Sunday. The eruption of Mount Nyiragongo on Saturday night sent about 5,000 people fleeing from the city of Goma across the nearby border into Rwanda, while another 25,000 others sought refuge to the northwest in Sake, the U.N. children's agency said Sunday."
drought,"Drought conditions are now covering 85 percent of Mexico in what is described as its worst in 30 years. As of Thursday, April 22, 2021, lakes and reservoirs have been reportedly drying up, including the country's second-largest body of freshwater.
According to Claudia Sheinbaum, the mayor of Mexico City, the drought was the worst in three decades, and the problem is evident in lakes and reservoirs, which are now at critically low levels.
Nine million residents in the capital rely on reservoirs, including Villa Victoria and two others, which together are at 44 percent capacity. Most of the rest comes from wells within city limits, but the city's own water table is plummeting, and leaky pipes waste much of what is brought into the area.
Isais Salgado, a 60-year-old resident, said Thursday that it took three and a half hours to pump water into his 10 000 liters (2 641 gallons) tanker-- a task that usually takes him just 30 minutes.
""The reservoir is drying up. If they keep pumping water out, by May it will be completely dry, and the fish will die.""
Sheinbaum added that as the dry spell worsened, more people have tended to water their gardens, exacerbating the problem.
Rogelio Angeles Hernandez, a 61-year-old resident, has been fishing in Villa Victoria for the past 30 years, said the real impact will be on the people in Mexico City."
drought,"Farmers along Australia's normally green eastern coast are reeling from the worst drought they have ever seen and face a tough summer if it doesn't rain in the next few months.
The NSW mid-north coast is usually a lush part of the country, with reliable rain and regular flooding.
But the region has been in drought for two years now and farmers say it is starting to bite.
""We normally get 40 inches of rain [a year] and I think we are up to around 8 inches,"" fourth-generation beef farmer Tony Saul told 7.30.
""And that might be all we're going to get for the year.""
He is standing in a dry river bed that stretches for hundreds of metres through his property near Kempsey.
It's usually full of water where his cattle drink.
""This is the longest and the driest it's been since I can remember and I've been here for my whole life,"" Mr Saul said.
""We've had dry periods — you know, it might be dry for three or four months.
""But it's been dry for 12 months here and the big concern is we've just been through our wet period of the calendar year.""
To help make ends meet, all five members of the Saul family have taken on extra jobs outside the farm.
""We've all still got loans to pay and the bank needs their money,"" Mr Saul said.
""So, we've got to have an income coming in.""
He has been doing extra work driving cattle trucks, but he also has to keep the farm ticking over.
Which makes for long days.
""Usually starting around 6 o'clock (in the morning),"" he said.
""I could be not getting home until 1 o'clock in the morning."
flood,"Heavy Rain Leads to Flash Flooding in Several States OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Heavy rain in several Midwestern states is causing flash flooding, and more rain is in the forecast.  A line of storms that began Wednesday continued through Thursday and into Friday, bringing winds that downed trees and power lines.  The storms also brought torrential rain. The Omaha World-Herald reported that more than 6 inches of rain fell near Murdock, Nebraska, on Thursday. Another Nebraska town, Falls City, got three-quarters of an inch of rain in 10 minutes, according to the National Weather Service. The rain caused flash flooding that closed several roads.  The weather service said a campground in Weeping Water, in Cass County, was evacuated before midnight Thursday.  Heavy rain also was reported in parts of Iowa, Missouri and Kansas. Several mid-Missouri roads were closed due to high water. In Columbia, several vehicles became stuck in flood waters."
other,"The Australian economy had been recovering faster than expected over the first half of this year. Output had surpassed pre-pandemic levels and, as at June, the unemployment rate had declined below pre-pandemic levels. Supported by fiscal and monetary policy stimulus, the Australian economy _ along with many others globally _ was on track to a robust expansion. In the absence of the latest virus outbreaks and lockdowns, the outlook would have been noticeably upgraded from 3 months ago.The recent outbreaks of the Delta variant of the COVID-19 virus are interrupting the recovery. The near-term outlook is highly uncertain and dependent on health outcomes. Further large outbreaks are possible, but the need for extended lockdowns should diminish as vaccination coverage increases. GDP will contract noticeably in the September quarter, and it is expected that employment will decline and the unemployment rate increase for a time. The experience of previous lockdowns is that much of the labour market adjustment will come through a decline in hours worked and labour force participation. The longer the lockdowns continue, however, the more likely it is that jobs are lost."
wildfires,"California is under a state of emergency and mandatory evacuations are in place as 25 wildfires continue to burn across the state. Now, an entire town could soon be in the fire's path, reports CBS News correspondent Carter Evans.
The Rocky Fire is the biggest, covering 54,000 acres, an area larger than San Francisco. It has already destroyed two-dozen homes, and upwards of 6,000 more are in danger.
It is just five percent contained and continues to grow. Erratic winds, on top of temperatures in the triple digits, have made a bad situation much worse.
The fire started five days ago, scorching nearly 85 square miles of land northwest of Sacramento, forcing thousands of people from their homes. It doubled in size over the weekend.
""I couldn't get back if I wanted to, and with the fire danger, I'm not sure I want to,"" one evacuated resident said.
Authorities want people to evacuate early because the fast-moving flames can cut off roads in minutes.
Just beyond the containment line, inside which crews work to box in the fire, lies the town of Clearlake, with a population of 15,000."
other,"The secondary market for loans can be an important mechanism for credit intermediaries to manage credit risk and liquidity risk on their balance-sheets, especially for distressed assets. Loan sales can facilitate risk transfer across intermediaries that originate credit (such as banks and non-banking financial companies) as well as from credit originators to intermediaries such as Asset Restructuring Companies (ARCs), Private Equity (PE) funds, Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs), etc. Presently, the secondary market for corporate loans in India is dominated by transactions of banks in non-performing assets and is constrained by sparse information on pricing and recovery rates.Recognising the benefits of an active secondary market in loans, the Reserve Bank will set up a Task Force to study the relevant aspects including best international practices and propose measures for developing a thriving secondary market for corporate loans in India. The measures explored would include, inter alia, loan contract standards, digital loan contract registry, ease of due diligence and verification by potential loan buyers, online platform for loan sales/ auctions, and accessible archive of historical market data on bids and sale prices for loans.The composition and terms of reference of the Task Force will be announced shortly. The Report of the Task Force will be due by end of August, 2019."
Typhoon,"Tropical Storm Fay sets sights on mid-Atlantic coast, New England The National Hurricane Center said Fay was about 70 miles east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, in its 8 p.m. advisory. MIAMI — Tropical Storm Fay slightly picked up speed and strength as it moved closer to land Friday, and forecasters decreased projections for rain totals and flooding. Fay was expected to bring 2 to 4 inches of rain, with the possibility of flash flooding in parts of the mid-Atlantic and southern New England, The U.S. National Hurricane Center said in its 5 a.m. advisory. That's down from earlier forecasts of about 3 to 5 inches of rain. The storm picked up speed Friday morning, moving north around 10 mph and producing top sustained winds of 50 mph, forecasters said. Earlier observations showed it moving at 8 mph with top sustained winds of 45 mph. A tropical storm warning remained in effect from Cape May, New Jersey, to Watch Hill, Rhode Island. The warning area includes Long Island and the Long Island Sound in New York, forecasters said. Fay is the earliest sixth-named storm on record, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach. The previous record was Franklin on July 22, 2005, Klotzbach tweeted."
other,"Even as inflation projections for Q2 have been revised marginally downwards vis-¨¤-vis the June statement, projections for Q3 onwards remain broadly unchanged. Several risks persist. First, crude oil prices continue to be volatile and vulnerable to both upside and downside risks. In particular, while geopolitical tensions and supply disruptions remain an upside risk to oil prices, the fall in global demand due to further intensification of protectionist trade policies could pull down oil prices. Second, volatility in global financial markets continues to impart uncertainty to the inflation outlook. Third, households¡¯ inflation expectations, as measured by the Reserve Bank¡¯s survey, have risen significantly in the last two rounds, which could influence actual inflation outcomes in the months to come. Fourth, manufacturing firms polled in the Reserve Bank¡¯s industrial outlook survey have reported hardening of input price pressures in Q2 of 2018-19. However, if the recent softening of global commodity prices persists, it could mitigate some of the upward pressure on input costs. Fifth, though the monsoon has been normal temporally so far, its regional distribution needs to be carefully monitored in the context of key CPI components such as paddy. Sixth, in case there is fiscal slippage at the centre and/or state levels, it could have adverse implications for market volatility, crowd out private investment and impact the outlook for inflation. Seventh, uncertainty around the full impact of MSP on inflation will only resolve in the next several months once the price support schemes are implemented. Finally, the staggered impact of HRA revision by state governments may push headline inflation up. While the statistical impact of HRA revisions will be looked through, there is need to watch out for any second-round impact on inflation.Against the above backdrop, the MPC decided to increase the policy repo rate by 25 basis points. The MPC reiterates its commitment to achieving the medium-term target for headline inflation of 4 per cent on a durable basis.The MPC notes that domestic economic activity has continued to sustain momentum and the output gap has virtually closed. However, uncertainty around domestic inflation needs to be carefully monitored in the coming months. In addition, recent global developments raise some concerns. Rising trade protectionism poses a grave risk to near-term and long-term global growth prospects by adversely impacting investment, disrupting global supply chains and hampering productivity. Geopolitical tensions and elevated oil prices continue to be the other sources of risk to global growth."

flood,"Over 1.5 million children at risk due to floods in central Viet Nam – UNICEF Widespread flooding and landslides in five provinces in central Viet Nam have left more than 1.5 million children at risk of disease, losing out on education and poor nutrition. At least 135,000 families have been directly impacted by flood water levels as high as two metres in certain municipalities, and over half a million people are unable to access safe water sources.  The floods damaged family homes, destroyed crops and livelihoods, and ravaged infrastructure. To date, 42 municipal health stations have reported damages and many more are cut off and inaccessible due to the flood waters, leaving mothers and children unable to access the basic and preventative health care so important in such times of heightened disease risk. In many locations, schools have been damaged and remain closed temporarily. As a result, nearly 1.2 million students are currently out of school and learning is disrupted. The window to provide relief is narrow as a new cyclone is heading toward the same coastal region and could make landfall in the next days.  UNICEF experts, who joined a team led by the Viet Nam Disaster Management Authority, have reached the most affected provinces and are assessing the situation of children and women to know the full extent of their needs. Based on the information gathered, UNICEF will raise and allocate further funds and expertise to support the government and communities, and address the many challenges they face."

Dozens more are missing, the country's disaster agency says, and it is feared the death toll could rise. Villages on the slopes of Fuego volcano were buried in volcanic ash, mud and rocks during Sunday's 16-hour eruption. Pyroclastic flows, which are fast-moving mixtures of very hot gas and volcanic matter, rushed down the mountainside and engulfed villages.

other,"The amount of wealth that the citizens of an economy choose to hold in the form of money¡ªas opposed to, for example, bonds or equities¡ªis known as the demand for money. There are three basic motives for holding money: transactions-related, precautionary, and speculative.The addition of 1 unit of additional reserves to a fractional reserve banking system can support an expansion of the money supply by an amount equal to the money multiplier, defined as 1/reserve requirement (stated as a decimal).The nominal rate of interest is comprised of three components: a real required rate of return, a component to compensate lenders for future inflation, and a risk premium to compensate lenders for uncertainty (e.g., about the future rate of inflation).Central banks take on multiple roles in modern economies. They are usually the monopoly supplier of their currency, the lender of last resort to the banking sector, the government¡¯s bank and bank of the banks, and they often supervise banks. Although they may express their objectives in different ways, the overarching objective of most central banks is price stability."
Typhoon,"Thick mud and debris coated many villages around the Philippine capital on Friday after a typhoon killed at least 42 people and caused extensive flooding that sent people fleeing to their roofs, officials said.
Troops, police, coast guard and disaster-response teams rescued tens of thousands of people, including many who flooded radio and TV networks and social media with desperate pleas for help.
Floodwaters receded and the weather cleared in many areas after Typhoon Vamco blew out into the South China Sea on Friday, but the military said it was still rescuing people trapped in some flooded communities.
Amphibious assault vehicles usually used in counter-insurgency operations were deployed for the rescue work, military chief of staff Gen. Gilbert Gapay said in a meeting with disaster-response officials.
“We’ll continue to look for the missing, help in damage assessment,” Gapay said.
The national police reported that the death toll had risen to at least 42 with 20 missing. The government’s main disaster-response agency, which waits for provincial reports and follows a laborious process of verifying casualties, reported a much lower death count, causing confusion.
Among the dead were at least 12 villagers who were dug out from mud and rockslides in the northern provinces of Cagayan and Nueva Vizcaya, police said.
After slamming into northeastern Quezon province, Vamco gained strength with sustained winds of 155 kilometers (96 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 255 kph (158 mph). It blew north of metropolitan Manila overnight Wednesday, toppling trees and power poles, swelling rivers, flooding residential communities and setting off landslides and storm surges.
In hard-hit Marikina city in the capital region and the towns of Rodriguez and Cainta in nearby Rizal province, several villages were inundated by water that reached the second and third floors of many houses, prompting hundreds of residents to flee to their roofs and call TV and radio networks or post desperate messages on social media. The panic was exacerbated by widespread power outages and loss of internet access.
Videos of Marikina showed a thick coat of muddy water covering roads and staining houses and cars. Residents carried appliances and furniture from their homes and used pails and shovels to remove the mud after the water receded.
In a televised meeting of Cabinet and disaster-response officials Friday, a reporter asked where President Rodrigo Duterte was, prompting an annoyed response from his spokesman."
wildfires,"California is in a state of emergency and two counties north of San Francisco were just declared a major federal disaster area as the Golden State endures its worst wildfire season in decades.
More than 9 million acres have burned so far in Western United States in what could shape up to be an all-time record year for fires.
At the same time, the wildfire season is growing longer than it was a few decades back, by as much as seven weeks in some areas. Earlier snowmelt in the West is contributing to this trend.
So why is the fire season this year worse than usual? The answer can be summed up with two words: It’s hot and dry.
And today, California, our most populous state, is the epicenter of the severe heat and crippling drought that are fueling the wildfires _ conditions scientists are increasingly linking to climate change."
Typhoon,"Often the first reinsurance-linked investment manager to come out with an official statement after a catastrophe event, Swiss ILS investment manager Plenum Investments has said that it does not expect any impact to its catastrophe bond fund from Japanese Typhoon Wipha.
Typhoon Wipha struck Japan just over 24 hours ago, brushing the main island of Honshu and passing by Tokyo only around 30 miles offshore. Wipha brought typhoon force winds and tropical rainstorms to much of Japan, the storm itself was almost as large as the entire country and the Japanese meteorological association called it the largest and most powerful typhoon to strike Japan in a decade.
Japanese typhoon risks are a peril which is part of the catastrophe bond market, with a few outstanding cat bonds having exposure to the peril and thus to typhoon Wipha.
Plenum Investments said that as typhoon Wipha passed Japan it merged with a cold front and transitioned into an extratropical storm, much like Sandy did in the U.S. Wipha was much weaker though and also passed by Tokyo near to low tide which meant that storm surge damage will have been minimal.
Typhoon Wipha badly impacted some islands in the Izu cluster to the south of Tokyo, causing extensive damage and some loss of life, but damage to Tokyo and other metro areas of Japan is not expected to have been severe. Plenum notes that Japanese building codes and construction standards are designed to withstand storms of this severity meaning that only minor damages are to be expected.
Plenum Investments cat bond fund has only a limited exposure to Japan typhoon risk, of around 1.5% of the funds NAV. Due to the nature of the storm and the minimal exposure, Plenum Investments does not expect typhoon Wipha to have an adverse effect on its Japan typhoon cat bond investments."
Typhoon,"A powerful typhoon that hit the Kinki and Shikoku regions passed into the Sea of Japan Sunday after leaving at least 20 people dead and 55 missing in six prefectures.
The dead included 12 in Wakayama Prefecture and three more in Nara Prefecture.
The figures could rise when rescue efforts — disrupted by damaged roads and other factors in some typhoon-hit areas, mainly in the Kii Peninsula of Wakayama Prefecture — resume, local authorities said.
Typhoon Talas had crossed Okayama and Tottori prefectures by Sunday afternoon, moving into the Sea of Japan.
But the Meteorological Agency still called for vigilance, noting the slow-moving typhoon could bring heavy rains to western Japan, possibly causing more mudslides and flooding.
In four towns in Wakayama, including Nachikatsuura and Shingu, more than 3,600 people in 37 areas had been cut off in isolated pockets of the prefecture as of Sunday night, it was learned."
wildfires,"A ferocious wildfire in Northern California that has killed an elderly woman, displaced 13,000 residents and destroyed hundreds of homes continued to grow Monday, chewing through 1,000 more acres by the time night fell.
The explosive Valley fire, which broke out in Lake County on Saturday, has overwhelmed firefighters who have scrambled to keep up with its unpredictable nature. Consuming 62,000 acres -- about 97 square miles _ it prompted the local sheriff to declare it the worst tragedy the area had ever seen.
The rain that fell Monday afternoon appeared to be a sign of reprieve, but fire officials warned that that was not the case.
“The reality is that a fire burning this hot, the falling rain never even makes it to the ground,” said Doug Pittman, a Cal Fire spokesman. “It’s vaporized before it gets to the fire.”
Pittman added that the landscape has become so desiccated that its response to water, even if sprayed directly on grass and trees, is minimal. A shift in other elements -- such as an increase in humidity or a decrease in wind speed -- would actually be more helpful.
The drop in temperature, however, has at least made conditions more comfortable for the 1,800 firefighters on the scene.
“We’ll take any and all precipitation that we can get,” Pittman said.
Shortly after the Valley fire began in the area of Cobb Mountain, residents began calling police for assistance with evacuations, Lt. Steve Brooks of the Lake County Sheriff’s office said in a statement. Hundreds of homes were evacuated in the first few hours."
valcano eruption,"Caribbean island tackles water, food shortages after volcano eruption The tiny eastern Caribbean island of Saint Vincent was rocked by a fifth day of eruptions from the La Soufriere volcano on Tuesday as leaders warned of shortages of water and the potential need for hundreds of millions of dollars to rebuild. The explosion happened around 6 a.m., causing another billowing plume of smoke and ash as well as pyroclastic currents of ash and rock hurtling down the volcano's flanks. Officials have warned it could continue to be active for months. Ash blankets much of the island, as thick as 8 inches (20 cm) in some parts. It has destroyed crops, contaminated water, killed animals and devastated infrastructure, also rendering some roads impassable, complicating search and rescue efforts."
Typhoon,"Former Hurricane Oscar, which peaked with winds over 100mph when it whipped through the Caribbean earlier this week, will pass near the British Isles on Saturday.
Although the weather system has now been downgraded, the Met Office has still issued a yellow warning for rain across western Scotland.
""Heavy and persistent rain” is expected across Scotland for much of the day, according to the Met Office.
Spray and flooding is expected to make driving much harder and journey times longer, and bus and train services will also be affected.
The first rains brought by the remnants of Hurricane Oscar will hit Northern Ireland on Friday afternoon, before the downpours and winds pick up early on Saturday morning for most of western Scotland and parts of north-western England.
By the end of Saturday the bad weather will have reached Wales and parts of eastern England as well, and BBC weather forecaster Nick Miller has warned that the winds could reach speeds of 60mph.
“Wherever you are, the breeze is picking up, particularly in the west. But it’s nowhere near as cold, but you may still see a touch of frost in eastern England,"" he said.
“The next system is a deep area of low pressure _ ex-Hurricane Oscar. It passes us to the northwest but we are close enough to get a windier day across the UK on Saturday and a very wet day in western Scotland.”
The mercury plummeted overnight, with the coldest spots seeing temperatures of -2C early on Friday morning. But the coming storms will see more mild temperatures, Mr Miller said, with temperatures of 8 or 9C on Saturday morning."
drought,"You’re probably familiar with the recent 5-year drought in California. That’s likely due in part to the intense media attention it attracted. At the peak of the coverage, there were nearly 30 times more drought-focused newspaper stories written per month than during an earlier Golden State drought that lasted from 2007 to 2009.
During the latest drought, even before California Gov. Jerry Brown mandated a 25 percent reduction in urban water use statewide in 2015, residents of the San Francisco Bay Area were consuming less water than they had a few years earlier. “The question was, what was driving them to reduce their water use?” asked Nicole Sandkulla, the CEO and general manager of the Bay Area Water Supply and Conservation Agency, a consortium of 26 cities and water districts.
New research suggests that newspapers were, in fact, part of the answer. Media attention — and the public awareness and engagement that follows — is one way to get people to use less water.
Researchers suspected that spikes in media coverage could be driving the drops in water consumption Sandkulla and others were seeing. To find out, Kimberly Quesnel and Newsha Ajami of Stanford University studied a decade’s worth of water use data, from 2005 to 2015, from 20 of the water agencies that belong to the Bay Area Water Supply and Conservation Agency. (The agency helped fund the study.)
The scientists also counted the number of articles related to drought that nine national and regional newspapers ran during the same period. There was less drought-centered coverage during the earlier drought, perhaps as a result of news coverage focused on the economic recession and the 2008 presidential election. The more recent dry spell, however, captured statewide and even national attention: The number of drought-focused articles published every month rose precipitously starting in 2014. “Drought in California was interesting, and it was the news of the day,” says Ajami, the director of urban water policy at Stanford’s Water in the West program."
drought,"At least six million children in Ethiopia face critical food shortages as a result of the worst drought in 50 years. 
The charity Save the Children warned on Friday that the number of Ethiopians without enough food is rising as the drought intensifies in the African country with children particularly vulnerable. 
The drought-affected area is vast with a population of about 30 million affected – with more than a third in need of emergency food assistance.
The region has now suffered three failed growing seasons in a row since mid-2014. More than 14,000 pastoralist families have been on the move since July, looking for work or clean water supplies.
Helle Thorning-Schmidt, chief executive of Save the Children, pressed the international community to step up its support for those suffering.
“Thousands of children are at high risk of malnutrition and waterborne diseases. Families are on the move, desperate to find food and water,” Helle said in a statement."
wildfires,"A major wildfire northwest of the Greek capital devoured large tracts of pine forest for a third day Wednesday and threatened a large village as hundreds of firefighters, assisted by water-dropping planes and helicopters, battled the flames.
The blaze in the Vilia area broke out Monday shortly after another wildfire started to the southwest of Athens. Several other villages and a nearby nursing home received evacuation orders.
On Wednesday, a shift in the winds drove the flames towards Vilia, 60 kilometers (37 miles) from Athens. Greek media said several outlying buildings were damaged, but no injuries were reported and no evacuation order was issued for the village.
Clouds of smoke obscured the sun, which cast an otherworldly, orange light over the capital.
Local mayor Christos Stathis told Open TV that the fire was within a few dozen yards from Vilia, and appealed for firefighting aircraft to be deployed to the spot.
Hundreds of wildfires have burned across Greece this month, fueled by parched forests and shrubland from the country’s most severe heat wave in decades.
The blazes have stretched the country’s firefighting capabilities to the limit, leading the government to appeal for international help, including through a European Union emergency response system. About two dozen European and Middle Eastern countries responded, sending planes, helicopters, vehicles and hundreds of firefighters.
The causes of the fires have not been officially established, although more than a dozen people have been arrested on suspicion of arson.
State ERT TV reported that a 14-year-old boy was arrested Wednesday in central Greece on suspicion of setting at least 13 fires in recent days — including one that raged out of control destroying homes and forest land. Quoting local officials, ERT said the suspect was caught on CCTV cycling away from spots where fires had started. The boy’s parents were arrested for neglect, ERT said.
Intense heat and wildfires have also struck other Mediterranean countries. Firefighters in France worked to contain a forest fire along the French Riviera on Tuesday, and recent wildfires have killed at least 75 people in Algeria and 16 in Turkey. Worsening drought and heat have also fueled wildfires in the western United States and in Russia’s northern Siberia region.
Greece’s fire department said 430 firefighters, including 143 from Poland, were deployed at the Vilia fire on Wednesday, along with 130 vehicles, 19 helicopters and 10 planes. The army, volunteer firefighters and local authorities also provided assistance.
By midday Wednesday, an estimated 7,500 hectares (18.500 acres) of forest had been destroyed in the area.
Satellite imagery from Tuesday showed a giant plume of smoke from the Vilia fire extending south for hundreds of kilometers along the entire length of the Peloponnese."
other,"Decisions on the application of the Central Bank's monetary policy instruments are taken by the Monetary Policy Committee.

other,"In its October 2018 Monetary Policy Statement, MAS announced a slight increase in the slope of the S$NEER policy band. There was no change to the width of the policy band or the level at which it was centred. This policy stance was assessed to be appropriate given the expectation that MAS Core Inflation would rise modestly in the near term before stabilising at just below 2%. The Singapore economy was also projected to remain on its steady expansion path.   The S$NEER has appreciated in the upper half of the policy band since October 2018. This mainly reflected the weakening of the US dollar alongside the shift in the US Federal Reserve¡¯s monetary policy stance, and of the Euro and Sterling. The three-month S$ SIBOR rose from 1.6% in October 2018 to 1.9% as at end-March 2019."
drought,"Drought throughout East Africa has sharply curbed harvests and pushed the prices of cereals and other staple foods to unusually high levels, posing a heavy burden to households and special risks for pastoralists in the region.
Local prices of maize, sorghum and other cereals are near or at record levels in swathes of Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania, according to the latest Food Price Monitoring and Analysis Bulletin (FPMA).
Inadequate rainfall in most areas of the sub-region has put enormous strain on livestock and their keepers. Poor livestock body conditions due to pasture and water shortages and forcible culls mean animals command lower prices, leaving pastoralists with even less income to purchase basic foodstuffs.
""Sharply increasing prices are severely constraining food access for large numbers of households with alarming consequences in terms of food insecurity,"" said Mario Zappacosta, FAO senior economist and coordinator of the Global Information and Early Warning System.
The trends in East Africa, where prices of staple cereals have doubled in some town markets, stand in marked contrast to the stable trend of FAO's Food Price Index, which measures the monthly change in international prices of a basket of traded food commodities.
The difference is due to the drought that is hammering the sub-region, where food stocks were already depleted by the strong El Niño weather event that ended only last year. Poor and erratic rainfall in recent months, crucial for local growing seasons, are denting farm output.
Somalia's maize and sorghum harvests are estimated to be 75 percent down from their usual level, and some 6.2 million people, more than half of the country's total population, now face acute food insecurity, with the majority of those most affected living in rural areas."
wildfires,"Driven by high winds sweeping across Northern California’s bone-dry fire zones Saturday, one of the state’s most explosive wildfires, the Caldor Fire, jumped across Highway 50, crossing a key line that fire officials hoped to use to slow the spread of the fast-moving blaze.
Firefighters battling the blaze as it burns through El Dorado County had been drumming up every available tactic to keep the blaze from crossing the highway, the main artery leading to Lake Tahoe for residents and visitors alike. On Saturday afternoon, the winds pushed flames and burning embers over the highway in the Kyburz area, according to Cal Fire Incident Commander Dusty Martin.
From the fire crews’ base camp in Placerville leading northeast to the Caldor Fire’s footprint, gusts of about 25 mph blew away a protective smoke layer and started pushing flames to the northeast — closing in on the highway and small communities dotted along the roadway and surrounding forestland.
By Saturday night, the blaze was 0% contained, had burned just over 90,000 acres, destroyed 270 structures, and was still threatening more than 13,000, according to Cal Fire.
Cal Fire commanders were working Saturday night to determine how fiercely the fire was burning on the north side of the highway, which includes terrain Cal Fire Capt. Stephen Horner said could present several new challenges, including steep canyons and very dense forested areas, that could make it harder to try and contain the already fast-moving blaze.
“A lot of those questions are being asked currently,” Horner said late Saturday.
Cal Fire spokesman Capt. Keith Wade said Saturday that the Placerville sky was the clearest it had been since midweek, an eerie marker that fearsome winds had arrived. The blaze broke out on Aug. 14.
“That’s not a good sign for what’s happening up the mountain,” Wade said Saturday. “We’re feeling a significant breeze down here, so we know that up the hill it’s very active. The potential for fire impacting those homes today is very real.”
As part of the defensive stand in the area of the highway, firefighters removed dry vegetation, trees and other fuels, while others placed sprinkler lines around houses to slow the flames’ spread. In total, more than 1,500 firefighters and support crews tackled the blaze Saturday, with most lined from Sly Park Road to Kyburz along the fire’s northern front.
Caltrans officials had closed a nearly 50-mile stretch of the highway on Friday out of fears that fire, poor visibility from smoke and falling ash or trees could endanger drivers’ lives.
Caltrans spokeswoman Angela DaPrato said Saturday that those heading to and from Tahoe should take Interstate 80, but steer clear of back roads that could be unexpectedly impacted by the fire. There was no estimate for when Highway 50 may reopen.
“Anything could happen,” she said."
other,"""What If...?"" might be the most Marvel Comics thing that Marvel Studios has done, translating the what-might-have-happened-if comic-book concept from page to screen, with all its geekiness intact. The highly stylized animation and access to key actors enhances the fun, creating an extremely logical Disney+ add-on to an increasingly packed multi-verse.
The ""What If...?"" comic made its debut in 1977, kicking off with the question ""What If Spider-Man Joined the Fantastic Four?"" As it turned out, altering one key moment in history -- the Fantastic Four had indeed offered Spidey membership, and he passed -- caused ripples large and small. As unintended consequences go, the anthological format offered examples of the butterfly effect via new stories each month, sometimes clever and others far-fetched.
Translating the spirit of that idea to TV has been executed with meticulous care, and both feet deeply rooted in the Marvel movies in terms of storylines and the cast members who vocally reprise their roles. Of those, the most wrenching and noteworthy is Chadwick Boseman, who recorded material as T'Challa/Black Panther before his death last year.
That episode, which weaves T'Challa into the Guardians of the Galaxy mythology, might be the most out-there of the three previewed, but it nicely encapsulates the ability to take wild swings that play off fans' passion for the movies.
Each story is introduced by the Watcher (Jeffrey Wright), an omniscient narrator sworn not to intervene in these twists of fate, who describes the multi-verse as ""a prism of endless possibilities.""
In the first, Agent Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) receives the super-soldier serum, becoming a smashing version of Captain America, only draped in the Union Jack instead of the stars and stripes. In another, someone seeks to interfere with the Avengers Initiative, touching upon the most fundamental building blocks of the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
other,"Economic conditions in Australia's major trading partners generally appear to have eased a little of late. Growth in China moderated further in the March quarter. Subdued investment growth in the manufacturing sector was partly offset by rising public infrastructure investment and a return to growth in real estate investment. The latter was consistent with a strengthening in the property market in recent months in response to a range of earlier measures to stimulate demand. The moderation of Chinese growth has affected Asian economies and emerging economies in other regions that have strong trade links with China. Economic activity remained weak in Japan, while growth eased in the United States but continued at an above-trend rate in the euro area. Meanwhile, there have been further improvements in labour market conditions across all three economies. Despite that, inflation in the major advanced economies remains below central banks' targets and inflation expectations have declined. This has been an important concern for central banks and contributed to the European Central Bank's decision to ease monetary policy further in March. Monetary policy settings remain very accommodative in Japan and the United States (where markets expect no further increase in the policy rate before late 2016)."
other,"Several favourable domestic factors are expected to drive this acceleration. First, the pace of remonetisation will continue to trigger a rebound in discretionary consumer spending. Activity in cash-intensive retail trade, hotels and restaurants, transportation and unorganised segments has largely been restored. Second, significant improvement in transmission of past policy rate reductions into banks¡¯ lending rates post demonetisation should help encourage both consumption and investment demand of healthy corporations. Third, various proposals in the Union Budget should stimulate capital expenditure, rural demand, and social and physical infrastructure all of which would invigorate economic activity. Fourth, the imminent materialisation of structural reforms in the form of the roll-out of the GST, the institution of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, and the abolition of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board will boost investor confidence and bring in efficiency gains. Fifth, the upsurge in initial public offerings in the primary capital market augurs well for investment and growth.The global environment is improving, with global output and trade projected by multilateral agencies to gather momentum in 2017. Accordingly, external demand should support domestic growth. Downside risks to the projected growth path stem from the outturn of the south west monsoon; ebbing consumer optimism on the outlook for income, the general economic situation and employment as polled in the March 2017 round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s consumer confidence survey; and, commodity prices, other than crude, hardening further."
earthquake,"An earthquake of 7.2 magnitude has struck off the coast of Japan, shaking buildings in the capital, Tokyo, and triggering a small tsunami.
The tremor was centred 168km (104 miles) from the east coast, north-east of Tokyo.
A 60cm (24in) tsunami reached the coastal town of Ofunato, with other towns reporting smaller waves shortly after the quake hit at 1145 (0245 GMT).
There are so far no reports of damage or injuries.
Japan is well-prepared for quakes which often hit the seismically active area.
An aftershock measuring 6.3 magnitude struck after the main quake, Japan's meteorological agency said, followed by a series of smaller aftershocks.
Some train services in the area were temporarily halted after the quake, but they were restarted shortly after noon.
Tohoku Electric Power said its Onagawa nuclear plant was operating normally after the quake and Tokyo Electric Power also said its power supplies were unaffected."
wildfires,"A wildfire in Gila national forest burned through more timber and brush lands as it forced the evacuation of residents living near a privately owned ghost town in south-western New Mexico, officials said.
Fueled by strong, erratic winds, the Whitewater-Baldy complex fire burning through rugged and remote terrain grew Saturday to an estimated 100,000 acres, or more than 150 square miles. It was still 0% contained.
The evacuation of Mogollon, a privately owned ghost town, was ordered Saturday due to extreme wind.
Five helicopters and more than 600 firefighters from around the state were on hand to fight the blaze but still had to contend with ""extreme conditions"".
Cities as far away as Albuquerque remained under a health alert until Sunday afternoon due to smoke from the fire, which has spread across the state. State officials were warning residents during the Memorial Day weekend to limit outdoor activities, especially if smoke was visible.
The haze that blocked views of the Sandia mountains in Albuquerque on Friday appeared to have decreased by early Saturday afternoon, but smoke continued to hang over parts of the city.
Meanwhile on Saturday, crews in Colorado battled a wildfire that has scorched more than 3,000 acres of rugged canyon land near the Colorado-Utah border. US forest service spokesman Steve Segin said the fire started Friday afternoon and is burning in a remote area near Paradox. It is not threatening any structures, and no injuries have been reported."
other,"The recent period has seen continued growth in demand and output in Australia as the expansion now moves into its sixteenth year. Labour market conditions have remained tight, and underlying inflationary pressures are higher than they were a year ago. These developments have taken place against the backdrop of strong international growth and high commodity prices.Most expectations are that the world economy will continue to grow at an above-average pace in the year ahead, albeit not quite as strongly as in 2006. While growth in the United States has moderated recently, strong economic conditions are generally prevailing in other parts of the world. Growth in the Chinese economy has remained above 10 per cent and there has been a significant improvement in conditions in the euro area since the beginning of the year. The expansion in Japan is continuing, and strong growth rates are being seen in a range of emerging economies in Asia and elsewhere. Overall the global expansion appears broadly based, and observers generally expect it to remain robust in the face of the moderate slowing now underway in the United States."
other,"The economic decisions of households can have a significant impact on an economy. For example, a decision on the part of households to consume more and to save less can lead to an increase in employment, investment, and ultimately profits. Equally, the investment decisions made by corporations can have an important impact on the real economy and on corporate profits. But individual corporations can rarely affect large economies on their own; the decisions of a single household concerning consumption will have a negligible impact on the wider economy.By contrast, the decisions made by governments can have an enormous impact on even the largest and most developed of economies for two main reasons. First, the public sectors of most developed economies normally employ a significant proportion of the population, and they are usually responsible for a significant proportion of spending in an economy. Second, governments are also the largest borrowers in world debt markets.Government policy is ultimately expressed through its borrowing and spending activities. In this reading, we identify and discuss two types of government policy that can affect the macroeconomy and financial markets: monetary policy and fiscal policy. "
Typhoon,"Subtropical storm Theta continues to brew in the central Atlantic, but it may be on course to reach the UK. 
We can expect the storm to travel in an east-northeast direction over the next few days, according to a report from the National Hurricane Center. 
It will move between the Azores and the Canary Islands towards Madeira this weekend, bringing a high chance of wet and windy conditions, before potentially hitting England, Wales and southern Ireland early next week.
It is the 29th named storm of the hurricane season, meaning that 2020 has now broken the old record of 28 named storms in 2005. Meteorologists say another could strike in the Caribbean in the coming days.
So far, storm Theta has maximum sustained winds of 50 MPH (85KM/H), but forecasters say it may strengthen slightly in the next 12 to 24 hours.
If Theta continues on its predicted trajectory, it will be felt most strongly across the Bay of Biscay, the La Manche region and throughout England and Wales, bringing with it the possibility of severe winds and heavy rains.
However, there are currently no coastal watches or warnings in effect; it’s still unclear whether the centre of the storm will hit land.
Cyclones within the Atlantic ocean become known as “tropical storms” and receive a name, when their wind speeds exceed 39 MPH. Only if the wind speed exceeds 75 MPH, do they become known as “hurricanes”. 
Tropical storms like Theta are a relatively rare occurrence in Europe, but 2020’s extreme season has seen storms hitting Western parts of Europe with increased frequency and bringing regional flooding, winds and damage.
The damage seen in Europe runs in parallel with the destruction caused this season across the US and countries further south, such as Belize, Bermuda, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Mexico and Guatemala."
drought,"Taiwan has further reduced its water supplies as the country faces its worst drought in 50 years. The government has issued its first red alert on water supply in six years on Wednesday, March 24, 2021, warning that reservoirs in the central region are dropping at dangerously low levels.
Authorities in Taiwan have stepped up their battle against the country's worst dry spell in five decades, further reducing water supplies to many areas, including a major hub of semiconductor manufacturing.
Water supply will also be cut by 15 percent to companies in two major science parks in Taichung, according to economics minister, Wang Mei Hua. 
Non-industrial users across Taichung and Miaoli County will lose water supply two days a week beginning April 6, Wang added. 
The government is reportedly under pressure to ensure continuous supply to water-intensive industries, such as semiconductor manufacturing, at a time when companies are clamoring for chips. 
Meanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) said the restrictions would not affect their production.
""Some TSMC fabs will slightly increase the proportion of water from tanker trucks to improve flexibility. The new requirement for us to cut water usage by 15 percent starting April 6 will not impact our operations,"" it stated.
Wang noted that earlier in March, Taiwan had enough water reserves to keep its technology companies operating smoothly until May, when seasonal rains often replenish supplies depleted during drier winter months."
other,"The MPC notes that the evolving trajectory needs to be carefully monitored. First, two of the key factors determining the cost of living conditions and inflation expectations, i.e., food and fuel inflation, edged up in November. Inflation expectations of households surveyed by the Reserve Bank have already firmed up and any increase in food and fuel prices may further harden these expectations. Second, rising input cost conditions as reflected in various surveys point towards higher risk of pass-through to retail prices in the near term. Third, implementation of farm loan waivers by select states, partial roll back of excise duty and VAT in the case of petroleum products, and decrease in revenue on account of reduction in GST rates for several goods and services may result in fiscal slippage with attendant implications for inflation. Fourth, global financial instability on account of the pace of/uncertainty over monetary policy normalisation in AEs and fiscal expansion in the US carry risks for inflation. The expected seasonal moderation in prices of vegetables, and fruits and the recent lowering of tax rates by the GST Council could mitigate upside pressures. Accordingly, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate on hold. However, keeping in mind the output gap dynamics, the MPC decided to continue with the neutral stance and watch the incoming data carefully. The MPC remains committed to keeping headline inflation close to 4 per cent on a durable basis. In the MPC¡¯s assessment, there have been several significant developments in the recent period which augur well for growth prospects, going forward. First, capital raised from the primary capital market has increased significantly after several years of sluggish activity. As the capital raised is deployed to set up new projects, it will add to demand in the short run and boost the growth potential of the economy over the medium-term. Second, the improvement in the ease of doing business ranking should help sustain foreign direct investment in the economy. Third, large distressed borrowers are being referenced to the insolvency and bankruptcy code (IBC) and public sector banks are being recapitalised, which should enhance allocative efficiency. However, the MPC notes that the impact of these factors can be buttressed by reducing the cost of domestic borrowings through improved transmission by banks of past monetary policy changes on outstanding loans."
other,"In January 2015, MAS reduced the slope of the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER) policy band, with no change to its width and the level at which it was centred.  This adjustment to the policy stance, which kept the S$NEER band on a modest and gradual appreciation path, was assessed to be appropriate in view of the more benign inflation outlook.   Since the Monetary Policy Statement (MPS) in January, the S$NEER has fluctuated within the lower half of the policy band.  It depreciated over February to mid-March amid the broad-based strength of the US$.  More recently, the S$NEER has strengthened. The three-month S$ SIBOR rose from 0.67% as at end-January 2015 to 1.01% as at end-March.  This reflected market expectations of prospective interest rate hikes in the US and of a strengthening of the US$ against the S$ at a time of general appreciation of the US$ against the major currencies.  These expectations also came after six years of very low US rates and a generally strengthening S$ against the US$."
Typhoon,"Bertha _ Atlantic Ocean May 28, 2020 _ NASA Looks at Inland Rainfall from Post Tropical Cyclone Bertha NASA’s GPM core satellite analyzed rainfall generated from post-tropical cyclone Bertha as it continues to move toward the Great Lakes. Bertha formed into a tropical storm on May 27, about 30 miles off the South Carolina coast. By 9:30 a.m. EDT, Bertha made landfall along the coast of South Carolina, east of Charleston. Data from NOAA and CORMP buoys showed that maximum sustained winds increased to near 50 mph (80 kph) before landfall. By 2 p.m. EDT, Bertha weakened to a tropical depression and heavy rainfall spread across the Carolinas. By 11 p.m. EDT, heavy rainfall spread across western North Carolina and southwest Virginia into West Virginia. At that time, the center of Bertha was located about 95 miles (150 km) south-southwest of Roanoke, Virginia. By May 28, Bertha had become a post-tropical cyclone. A Post-Tropical Storm is a generic term for a former tropical cyclone that no longer possesses sufficient tropical characteristics to be considered a tropical cyclone. Former tropical cyclones that have become fully extratropical, subtropical, or remnant lows, are three classes of post-tropical cyclones. In any case, they no longer possess sufficient tropical characteristics to be considered a tropical cyclone. However, post-tropical cyclones can continue carrying heavy rains and high winds."
earthquake,"NEW DELHI: Indian authorities on Saturday said there were no initial reports of critical damage to buildings and infrastructure, or casualties, in its northern states after intense tremors from a quake in the central Asian nation of Tajikistan on Friday night.
The U.S Geological Survey put the quake's magnitude at 5.9 and centred 35 km (55 miles) west of Tajikistan in central Asia.
As people prepared to go to sleep on Friday strong tremors were felt by residents in the northe .
No casualties have been reported so far, he said, adding that the tremors lasted for a long time and could have damaged some parts of residential and public properties.
Fire authorities said there were reports of superficial damage to buildings from the quake, which forced tens of thousands of people outside their homes in India's Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab and New Delhi."
Typhoon,"A storm called Potential Tropical Cyclone Six is expected is expected to bring rain and life-threatening flash flooding to the Cabo Verde Islands in the eastern Atlantic. The storm could strengthen into a hurricane by Sunday.
It has already been determined that it will be named Tropical Storm Florence as it gathers pace - becoming the seventh named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season.
The latest advisory for the storm — released at 7am Central time — said that the storm was 190 miles east-southeast of the southernmost point of those islands, and was moving at 12mph.
Compared to the types of major storms that have walloped American shores in the past, the as-of-yet-unnamed storm is relatively weak — clocking in with winds of 35 mph — but the system is expected to strengthen over the next week and may be classified as a hurricane in the coming days.
That said, tropical storm warnings remain in effect for Cabo Verde Islands Santiago, Fogo, and Brava, where residents can expect the potential for heavy rain and gusty winds later on in the day.
Where it goes from there is hard to predict — storms are fickle things and often change direction — but the hurricane centre’s long-range tracker pegs it as moving on a west to northwest path in the coming days. Early next week, the storm is likely to be far from the United States mainland."
wildfires,"Wildfires throughout the south are causing millions of dollars worth of damages, threatening the health and safety of residents. Arson is the suspected cause, according to authorities.
More than 5,000 firefighters and support staff from around the nation have traveled to the southeast to try and contain the blazes, the U.S. Forest Service told The Associated Press. The fires are in seven states, including Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, and the Carolinas.
North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory said at a news conference today that a dozen wildfires have spread over parts of parts of his state, costing at least $10 million.
The federal government will pay 75 percent of the costs, he said.
The governor cited dry weather conditions as the cause behind the rapid spread. The risks in the state will rise as drier weather returns and leaves continue to fall, firefighters told the AP last weekend.
""These conditions are expected for a long time throughout these winter months,"" McCrory said.
Firefighters from California, Alaska, Oregon and other states have arrived to help, he added."

other,"On the domestic front, economic activity picked up pace in June-July as some states eased pandemic containment measures. As regards agriculture, the south-west monsoon regained intensity in mid-July after a lull; the cumulative rainfall up to August 1, 2021 was one per cent below the long-period average. The pace of sowing of kharif crops picked up in July along with some high frequency indicators of rural demand, notably tractor and fertiliser sales.Reflecting large base effects, industrial production expanded in double digits year-on-year (y-o-y) in May 2021 on top of the massive jump in April, but it was still 13.9 per cent below its May 2019 level. The manufacturing purchasing managers¡¯ index (PMI) that had dropped into contraction to 48.1 in June for the first time in 11 months, rebounded well into expansion zone with a reading of 55.3 in July. High-frequency indicators _ e-way bills; toll collections; electricity generation; air traffic; railway freight traffic; port cargo; steel consumption, cement production; import of capital goods; passenger vehicle sales; two wheeler sales _posted strong growth in June/July, reflecting adaptations to COVID related protocols and easing of containment. Services PMI remained in contractionary zone due to COVID-19 related restrictions, though the pace eased to 45.4 in July from 41.2 in June 2021. Initial quarterly results of non-financial corporates for Q1:2021-22 show healthy growth in sales, wage growth and profitability led by information technology firms.Headline CPI inflation plateaued at 6.3 per cent in June after having risen by 207 basis points in May 2021. Food inflation increased in June primarily due to an uptick in inflation in edible oils, pulses, eggs, milk and prepared meals and a pick-up in vegetable prices. Fuel inflation moved into double digits during May-June 2021 as inflation in LPG, kerosene, and firewood and chips surged. After rising sharply to 6.6 per cent in May, core inflation moderated to 6.1 per cent in June, driven by softening of inflation in housing, health, transport and communication, recreation and amusement, footwear, pan, tobacco and other intoxicants (as the effects of the one-off post-lockdown taxes imposed a year ago waned), and personal care and effects (due to sharp reduction in inflation in gold).System liquidity remained ample, with average daily absorption under the LAF increasing from _5.7 lakh crore in June to _6.8 lakh crore in July and further to _8.5 lakh crore in August so far (up to August 4, 2021). Auctions for a cumulative amount of _40,000 crore in Q2:2021-22 so far under the secondary market government securities acquisition programme (G-SAP) evened liquidity across illiquid segments of the yield curve. Reserve money (adjusted for the first-round impact of the changes in the cash reserve ratio) expanded by 11.0 per cent y-o-y on July 30, 2021 driven by currency demand. As on July 16, 2021, money supply (M3) and bank credit by commercial banks grew by 10.8 per cent and 6.5 per cent, respectively. India¡¯s foreign exchange reserves increased by US$ 43.1 billion in 2021-22 (up to end-July) to US$ 620.1 billion."
other,"Measures of inflation have largely tracked underlying cost conditions. In the case of industrial and farm costs in the WPI and remained elevated in Q2 so far (Chart II.18). The rise in global crude oil prices impacted domestic prices of inputs such as high speed diesel, aviation turbine fuel, naptha, bitumen, furnace oil and petroleum coke, pushing up domestic farm and nonfarm costs. Input cost pressures weakened slightly in July 2018, reflecting soft metal prices and transient easing of global crude oil prices.Among other industrial raw materials, domestic coal inflation slowed down significantly as compared with the previous year¡¯s level. Inflation in respect of paper and paper products has also remained moderate so far, reflecting inter alia cheap imports of paper under free trade agreements with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and South Korea. Inflation in prices of fibres (specifically cotton, jute and mesta) after remaining in negative territory during February to May 2018, picked up subsequently due to elevated international prices and lower production estimates for 2018-19 season.Among farm sector inputs, inflation in respect of agricultural input prices such as fertilisers increased gradually in line with international prices. Despite rising demand, prices of tractors remained stable on the back of increased competition as tractor firms aspired to expand their market shares. Inflation in respect of pesticides and other agrochemical products was driven by uptick in inflation in insecticide and pesticide even as deflation in fungicide prices continued. Prices of fodder remained in deflation due to increased production on the back of good monsoons during the last two years. Inflation in respect of electricity, which has a high weight in both industrial and farm inputs, rose significantly during May-August, reflecting mainly the price surge on account of supply disruptions in the summer following severe dust storms in northern India and adverse base effect in August. Additionally, the distribution companies (DISCOMS) raised their tariffs, following the diversion of coal supplies by the government away from captive power producers to thermal power plants with low stocks."
other,"The Singapore economy will grow at an above-trend pace this year, but the sectors worst hit by the crisis will continue to face significant demand shortfalls. As the negative output gap narrows, core inflation should rise gradually from its current subdued levels but remain below its historical average.MAS will therefore maintain a zero percent per annum rate of appreciation of the policy band. The width of the policy band and the level at which it is centred will be unchanged. As core inflation is expected to stay low this year, MAS assesses that an accommodative policy stance remains appropriate."
Typhoon,"Tropical Storm Cristobal develops in the Gulf of Mexico, may approach the U.S. by weekend We may be only on the second day of the official 2020 hurricane season, but already we’re tracking our third named tropical system in the Atlantic. Tropical Storm Cristobal was spinning in the Bay of Campeche at midday Tuesday. By the end of the week, the system is expected to slowly intensify in the Gulf of Mexico, with some data suggesting the storm could ultimately approach or even make a U.S. landfall. Tropical storm warnings are already up in Mexico from Campeche to Puerto de Veracruz as the system continues to organize, while there is concern closer to home for possible impacts by the weekend, depending on the storm’s track and intensity. The system was declared a “tropical depression” on Monday evening and upgraded to a tropical storm at 12:30 p.m. Eastern. This is the earliest third-named storm to form in the Atlantic basin, with the previous record being Tropical Storm Colin, which formed on June 5, 2016. The jury is out as to how exactly the storm will evolve. In fact, there’s even an outside chance that two named storms brew in the Gulf."
earthquake,"After the earthquake of 6.4 magnitude on the Richter scale on Wednesday, Assam's Sonitpur was struck by six tremors on Thursday.
An earthquake of magnitude 2.7 on the Richter scale struck Assam's Sonitpur in the early hours of Thursday morning, said the National Center for Seismology (NCS). This is the sixth earthquake that occurred in Sonitpur on Thursday after 12.00 am.
According to the NCS, the quake occurred at 2:38 am. The epicentre of the earthquake was 38 kilometres West-Northwest of Tezpur at a depth of 11 kilometres.
Earlier today, earthquakes of magnitude 2.6, 2.9, 4.6, 2.7, and 2.3 on the Richter Scale had hit Sonitpur at 12.24 am, 1.10 am, 1.20 am, 1.41 am and 1.52 am respectively.
Prior to that on Wednesday, around 10 earthquakes had hit the Sonitpur throughout the day. The most severe among them was an earthquake of magnitude 6.4 on the Richter scale that struck Sonitpur on Wednesday morning.
According to the National Center for Seismology, the area is seismically very active falling in the highest Seismic Hazard zone V associated with collisional tectonics where Indian plate subducts beneath the Eurasian Plate.
""The historical and instrumentally recorded earthquake data (NCS catalogue) reveals that the region is affected by moderate to large earthquakes and the most prominent events among those are the July 29, 1960, Assam earthquake of magnitude 6.0,"" said NCS in a release."

earthquake,"A series of aftershocks jolted central Croatia on Wednesday, a day after a 6.3-magnitude earthquake killed at least seven people, injured dozens and left several towns and villages in ruins.
Authorities warned that the coronavirus could spread in crowded shelters. Many people are in tents, their cars or military barracks.
The strongest, 4.7-magnitude tremor was recorded near the heavily damaged town of Petrinja, some 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of the capital, Zagreb.
Neven Pavkovic, a resident, said the aftershocks kept him awake: ""It was a rough night, I slept maybe half an hour.”
In the hard-hit village of Majske Poljane, where five people died, a little boy could be seen sleeping in a van on the chilly morning.
Sobbing villagers said they received blankets, food and other aid but don’t know what they will do next. Rain that fell overnight turned the dust from the rubble into mud, adding to the hardship.
“We can’t say ‘Good morning,’ It is not good,” Petrinja mayor Darinko Dumbovic told Croatian radio. “We had the third and fourth tremors this morning, short ones but strong. What hasn’t fallen off before is falling now from the ruins of Petrinja.”
“Fear has crept into people,"" he said.
Pope Francis prayed for the victims. At the end of his weekly audience, he said: ”I particularly pray for those who died and for their families.”
Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said the government will declare Saturday a day of national mourning. As the government abolished a travel ban between counties that was imposed during the holidays because of the coronavirus pandemic, Plenkovic appealed for respect for other measures.
“We are still fighting COVID-19, it wouldn’t be good to relax now,” Plenkovic said at a government session.
The International Committee of the Red Cross said it had deployed its Croatian staff in the quake-hit area, and warned of the possible spread of the coronavirus amid the emergency.
“Hundreds of people who were forced to leave their homes are accommodated in communal buildings and tents, while others are seeking shelter in different parts of the country, increasing the risk of transmission,"" a statement said.
Croatian officials said a 12-year-old girl died in Petrinja, a town of some 25,000 people. At least 26 people were hospitalized with injuries.
Tuesday's quake, the strongest in Croatia since the introduction of the modern seismic measurement system, was felt throughout the region, including neighboring Bosnia, Serbia and Slovenia.
The central Croatian region was also struck by a 5.2 earthquake on Monday."
Typhoon,"Hurricane Hanna makes landfall in Texas Hurricane Hanna battered southern Texas with sustained winds of 75 mph and continued to deliver heavy rain and flash flooding as it moved inland late Saturday. The Category 1 hurricane was moving west at about 8 mph when it made landfall at Padre Island, about 15 miles north of Port Mansfield, around 5 p.m. local time on Saturday. Very heavy rain, strong winds and storm surge impacted the south Texas coast, the worst of it south of Corpus Christi, down to the mouth of the Rio Grande River. While wind and storm surge were notable along the coast during the afternoon, very heavy rain and the potential for widespread flash flooding across the Rio Grande Valley was the biggest concern into Saturday night. Rainfall totals over extreme southern Texas to the Mexico border could lead to dangerous flash flooding. ""Any hurricane is an enormous challenge, this challenge is complicated and made even more severe seeing it is sweeping through an area that is the most challenged area in the state for COVID-19,"" said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. ""We cannot allow this hurricane to lead to a more deadly event by stoking COVID-19 leading to more fatalities."" Abbot said disaster declarations have been made in 32 counties. The National Weather Service in Brownsville reported ""significant structural damage"" in nearby Port Mansfield and a gust up to 83 mph. As is usually the case with land-falling tropical systems, isolated tornadoes are possible along the southern Texas coast through Saturday evening. Hanna will begin to rapidly weaken Saturday tonight and Sunday morning as it moves into northern Mexico. However, it will continue to bring widespread heavy rain and the threat of dangerous flash flooding across the Rio Grande Valley even as the wind speeds go down."
earthquake,"Turkey begins rehabilitation efforts in quake-hit east Turkey has started rehabilitation efforts for the victims of Sunday’s deadly earthquakes in its eastern Van province, the country’s environment and urbanization minister said. At least nine people died and dozens were injured when two magnitude 5.9 earthquakes struck near the border region with Iran, Turkish authorities said. Tremors were felt in eastern Turkey. “A total of 245 houses and 297 barns were destroyed and 694 buildings were damaged in Van,” Murat Kurum told Anadolu Agency’s Editor’s Desk on Monday. He said the border villages were the worst hit as the locals live in unsteady mud houses. “While we carry out damage assessment in the region, our priority is to rebuild permanent residences for our citizens who lost their houses,” he said. Stressing 66% of Turkey’s land and 71% of its population is located on quake zones, he said there was a need to design cities and infrastructure keeping this in mind. He recalled that more than half of the quakes which hit the country were above magnitude 6. In 1999, Turkey's Marmara region was jolted by two massive quakes that claimed lives of tens of thousands. He said the government has spent 170 billion Turkish liras ($27.6 billion) on an urban transformation project. A total of 230 billion Turkish liras ($37.3 billion) have been earmarked for the project that has so far built 1,350,000 houses. A million more houses will be built."

Among advanced economies (AEs), the US economy, which ended 2017 on a slightly weak note, appeared to have bounced back in Q1:2018; the unemployment rate remains low with hiring around multi-month highs. In the Euro Area, economic activity remained buoyant, although consumer spending and factory activity slowed down due to the strengthening of the euro, but a consistently falling unemployment rate and elevated consumer confidence continued to underpin the strength of the economy.

Among advanced economies (AEs), the US economy rebounded strongly in Q2, after modest growth in Q1, on the back of rising personal consumption expenditures and exports. In the Euro Area, weak growth in Q1 continued in Q2 due to subdued consumer demand, weighed down by political uncertainty and a strong currency. In Japan, recent data on retail sales, consumer confidence and business sentiment point to moderation in growth.Economic activity in major emerging market economies (EMEs) has slowed somewhat on volatile and elevated oil prices, mounting trade tensions and tightening of financial conditions. The Chinese economy lost some pace in Q2, pulled down by efforts to contain debt. The Russian economy picked up in Q1; recent data on employment, industrial production and exports indicate that the economy has gained further momentum. South Africa¡¯s economy contracted in Q1; though consumer sentiment has improved, high unemployment and weak exports pose challenges. In Brazil, economic activity suffered a setback in Q1 on nation-wide strikes; more recent data suggest that growth remained muted as industrial production contracted in May and the manufacturing purchasing managers¡¯ index (PMI) declined."

Gross domestic product (GDP) growth for 2017-18 has been estimated at 6.7 per cent, up by 0.1 percentage point from the second advance estimates released on February 28. This increase in growth has been underpinned by a significant upward revision in private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) due especially to improved rural demand on the back of a bumper harvest and the government¡¯s thrust on rural housing and infrastructure. Quarterly data suggest that the economy grew at 7.7 per cent in Q4:2017-18 _ the fastest pace in the last seven quarters. Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) growth accelerated for three consecutive quarters up to Q4.On the supply side, estimates of agriculture and allied activities have been revised upwards, supported by an all-time high production of foodgrains and horticulture during the year. On a quarterly basis, agriculture growth increased sharply in Q4:2017-18.

More recently, however, the downturn in economic activity appears to be abating and financial conditions have eased somewhat, developments that partly reflect the broad range of policy actions that have been taken to address the crisis. Nonetheless, credit conditions for many households and businesses remain tight, and financial markets are still stressed. In the labor market, employment declines have remained sizable--although the pace of job loss has diminished somewhat from earlier in the year--and the unemployment rate has continued to climb. Meanwhile, consumer price inflation has remained subdued."

Typhoon,"Hurricane season may kick off early, with the potential for the year's first named storm to form off the coast of Florida and the Bahamas.
Tropical (or, potentially, Subtropical) Storm Arthur, as it will be called if conditions develop into a named storm system - has a 70 per cent chance of forming over the next five days, according to the US National Hurricane Center.
In order for a tropical storm to become a hurricane, it has to establish a warm core, which then must intensify into hurricane-force winds.
Hurricane season usually begins on 1 June, but the storm season is starting early this year due in part to the above-average temperatures across the Atlantic ocean. In addition to its early start, meteorologists are predicting this year will have an especially active hurricane season, with most expecting more than six named hurricanes, and some meteorologists predicting more than nine.
The Orlando Sentinel reported that Floridians aren't likely to be overly affected by the storm. Speaking to Jayme King, a meteorologist for local news station Fox 35, the paper reported that Floridians can expect a 40 to 50 per cent chance of rain on Friday near Orlando, with heavier rainfall in the south of the state.

wildfires,"A giant bushfire on the edge of Sydney, which has blanketed the city in smoke causing a spike in respiratory illnesses and the cancellation of outdoor sports, will take weeks to control but will not be extinguished without heavy rains, firefighters said.
Thousands of weary firefighters, who have been battling wildfires for a month, have been fighting nearly 100 blazes in New South Wales state.
The mega fire north of Sydney, Australia‘s largest city, was created on Friday when several fires merged and was now burning across 335,000 hectares.
“We need flooding rain to put these fires out. That’s really what is going to stop it,” said the New South Wales Rural Fire Service. “These will take many weeks to put out.”
Wildfires are common in Australia during the hot summer, which begins in December, but this year the fires started much earlier, blamed on soaring temperatures, dry winds and arson.
A three-year drought has left much of Australia tinder dry.
The fires around Sydney have been pumping such vast amounts of smoke into the air that they appear as significant rain on the radars, the Bureau of Meteorology said on Twitter.
New South Wales Health said late on Friday that some 1,140 people had sought medical assistance for breathing issues or asthma in the past week _ a quarter more than in a typical week. NSW Ambulance fielded about a third more calls.
Six people have been killed, nearly 700 houses burnt down and millions of hectares of land razed.

other,"Net exports continued to drag down aggregate demand in Q1:2018-19, though on a smaller scale than in the previous four quarters. India¡¯s merchandise exports recovered smartly from the implementation effects of the GST and rode on improving global demand to expand at 14.6 per cent in US dollar terms in Q1:2018-19, a step-up from the average of 10.1 per cent in the previous four quarters (Chart III.16a). The recovery in export growth was strongly supported by non-oil exports such as engineering goods, chemicals and drugs and pharmaceuticals (Chart III.17a). Oil exports too expanded, but mainly on the back of a surge in international crude oil prices. Merchandise import growth during Q1:2018-19 was the slowest in four quarters on account of an unfavourable base effect and a decline in gold imports. There was also some moderation in non-oil non-gold imports with the decline in imports of pearls and precious stones, pulses and vegetable oil (Chart III.17b). The combined impact of the escalation in international crude oil prices and a pick-up in import volumes pushed up the oil import bill to a 15-quarter high. Notwithstanding the improved export performance, India¡¯s merchandise trade deficit during Q1:2018-19 was the highest in last 20 quarters. During July-August 2018-19, both export and import growth improved. Exports benefitted from increased shipments of petroleum products, engineering goods and gems and jewellery. Petroleum, gold, coal and electronic goods supported import growth.In Q1:2018-19, 65 per cent of India¡¯s merchandise trade deficit was financed through invisibles, i.e., net export of services, income and remittances. Net services exports grew by 2.1 per cent on a y-o-y basis, primarily driven by exports of software and financial services. In gross terms, India¡¯s services export recorded a growth of 4.9 per cent in Q1:2018-19 (Chart III.16b). India accounts for a large share (13.1 per cent share in total exports of the top 10 exporting economies)7 of global exports of telecommunications, computer and information services. Major IT companies reported significant improvement in their export revenues in Q1:2018-19, which might also have extended into Q2:2018-19 in view of the weakness of the rupee. Optimistic forecasts of global IT spending in 2018 also bode well for the outlook for software exports. Net remittances _ mainly private transfers, which supplement gross domestic disposable income _ rose by 17.5 per cent in Q1:2018-19, reflecting firmer demand conditions in source countries as also rising international crude oil prices, both of which imply a favourable outlook for these flows. Despite increase in net receipts of services exports and remittances in Q1:2018-19, trade deficit caused a slight widening of the current account deficit to US$ 15.8 billion (2.4 per cent of GDP) as compared with US$ 15.0 billion (2.5 per cent of GDP) in Q1:2017-18."

It is in scrub and farmland at Marcollat, west of Padthaway, and was first reported about noon ACDT on Sunday.
The Country Fire Service (CFS) said thick scrub and sandy terrain posed challenges for fire crews.
The fire jumped the containment lines several times overnight, but is now within the breaks.
The greatest risk remains that the fire could spread north, but temperatures were lower on Monday and winds light, after Sunday saw temperatures in the low 40s and northerly winds of up to 40kph.
Residents at Lucindale, Naracoorte and Padthaway were being warned to keep doors and windows closed, because of smoke.
Regional fire commander Jason Druwitt said more local fire crews had been brought in on Monday morning, to help with mopping up efforts.
""The plan is to release all the crews from the fire ground at 1700,"" he said.
He said it was hoped all the firefighters could be home for Christmas and local landholders would keep watch until crews were again in the area on Boxing Day.
At the height of the blaze, there were four water bombers, 25 fire appliances and about 100 firefighters tackling the outbreak.
The CFS said an irrigation pump fire sparked the wider blaze, which blackened about 6,000 hectares."

Firms responding to the Reserve Bank¡¯s Industrial Outlook Survey (IOS) continued to report input price pressures and increase in selling prices in Q3. This is also confirmed by manufacturing and services firms polled by PMI. Organised sector wage growth remained firm, while the rural wage growth decelerated.The liquidity in the system continues to be in surplus mode, but it is moving steadily towards neutrality. The weighted average call rate (WACR) traded 12 basis points (bps) below the repo rate during December-January as against 15 bps below the repo rate in November. On some days in December and January, the system turned into deficit due to slow down in government spending and large tax collections, which necessitated injection of liquidity by the Reserve Bank. During the two weeks beginning December 16, 2017, the Reserve Bank injected average daily net liquidity of _ 388 billion into the system. For December as a whole, however, the Reserve Bank absorbed _ 316 billion (on a net daily average basis). As the system turned into deficit again in the fourth week of January, the Reserve Bank injected average net liquidity of _ 145 billion. For January, on the whole, the Reserve Bank absorbed _ 353 billion (on a net daily average basis).Merchandise exports bounced back in November and December. While petroleum products, engineering goods and chemicals accounted for three-fourths of this growth, exports of readymade garments contracted. During the same period, merchandise import growth accelerated sequentially with over one-third of the growth emanating from petroleum (crude and products) due largely to high international prices. Gold imports increased _ both in value and volume terms _ in December, after declining in the preceding three months. Pearls and precious stones, electronic goods and coal were major contributors to non-oil non-gold import growth. With import growth exceeding export growth, the trade deficit for December was US$ 14.9 billion.Even though the current account deficit narrowed sharply in Q2 of 2017-18 on a sequential basis, it was higher than its level a year ago, mainly due to widening of the trade deficit. While net foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows moderated in April-October 2017 from their level a year ago, net foreign portfolio investment (FPI) inflows were buoyant in 2017-18 (up to February 1). India¡¯s foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 421.9 billion on February 2, 2018"

Even now at the age of 31, those two words still play on the Olympic high jumper's mind. Raised by a single mother in New Jersey, Loomis also toyed with the idea of becoming an actor and that's a dream she hasn't given up on as she has pursued her athletics career.

Hudson first came to fame in 2004 as a finalist on ""American Idol."" She auditioned for the reality singing competition with Franklin's song, ""Share Your Love With Me.""
Fast forward to 2021 and Hudson is now a Grammy winning singer and an Academy Award winning actress whom Franklin handpicked to portray her in the biopic ""Respect"" prior to her death in 2018. (Hudson won the best supporting actress Oscar in 2007 for her performance in ""Dreamgirls.)
Hudson told CNN she's long considered why the Queen of Soul wanted her in the role.
""This is beyond singing and acting,"" Hudson said. ""I think she saw something in me...I would not have been able to go as deep as I did to tell the story in an honest way without my own life experiences. So, I think she saw that in me, as well as everything else as far as being an actress and a singer.""
""Respect"" tells the story of the rise of Franklin from the little girl singing in her father's church in Detroit to the megastar who would go on to become the first women inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
Along the way there was tragedy and triumph, something Hudson can absolutely relate to.
From her elimination too early (in the eyes of many who cheered her on) on ""American Idol"" to the incredibly painful murders of her mother, brother and young nephew at the hands of her sister's boyfriend in 2008, Hudson has persevered through great adversity and brings that to her portrayal of Franklin."

The earthquake measured at magnitude 4.7 at its epicenter 8 kilometers southeast of Armenia’s capital, reported the national seismic protection agency. It said tremors were also felt in five of the country’s ten provinces. According to the Armenian Ministry of Health, the quake did not kill or injure anyone. The ministry reported only minor injuries sustained by three people “as a consequence of panic caused by the earthquake.” The Ministry of Emergency Situations urged local residents to stay outdoors shortly after Yerevan was jolted by the quake at around 3:30 p.m. local time. It said it has registered 46 aftershocks. In another statement issued at 7 p.m., the ministry told people to return to their homes. “The analysis of available data shows that the likelihood of a powerful earthquake is low,” it said. The quake appeared to have caused no serious material damage in or outside Yerevan. The Ministry of Emergency Situation reported tentatively that it damaged only one house and three buildings in the city of one million."
drought,"I walk in the front door of Byron Carter’s house as others are entering in the back, and Koda the dog can’t decide which way to direct her barking. I’m in Divide County, North Dakota, but borders seem a little meaningless here. Last summer’s drought, which was calamitous for Byron and the other farmers and ranchers now filing into his kitchen, leaked over into Canada, Divide’s border to the north, and Montana, to the west. By April of this year, they’re on the cusp of a new season, and Byron has gathered his neighbors—defined as anyone living within a 30-mile radius in this sparsely populated corner of the state—so we can talk about drought and climate change.
Drought is an especially wily adversary. As an officer of the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services told me recently, “You can’t put up a sandbag wall to stop a drought.”
In Divide County, agricultural producers are especially vulnerable to the effects of drought, since they depend on dryland methods. Dryland farmers use no irrigation. Instead, they rely wholly on rain: to initiate the lush growth of little bluestem and other pastureland grasses that will sustain their herds through the summer, and to secure the hay harvest that will get the herd through the winter. Not to mention the rain they need for their wheat, barley and pea cash crops.
In 2017, ranchers were optimistic when they put their cattle out to graze in late spring. There’d been record snowfall over the winter, and regional forecasts weren’t calling for any drought conditions in their northwest region of the Great Plains. By May, though, concerns were rising. Rain failed to come, and the good winter moisture evaporated into a cloudless sky. By July, two-thirds of the pastureland in the Dakotas was in poor condition, and across the High Plains, from Kansas up to Canada, temperatures were above normal while precipitation was low—perfect conditions for what’s known as a “flash drought,” sudden and severe."

other,"CPI inflation excluding food and fuel accelerated to 6.1 per cent in October; adjusted for the estimated HRA impact, it was 5.9 per cent. Transport and communication registered a marked increase, pulled up by higher petroleum product prices, transportation fares and prices of automobiles. A broad-based increase was also observed in health, household goods and services, and personal care and effects. However, inflation moderated significantly in clothing and footwear, as also housing on waning of the HRA impact of central government employees. Inflation expectations of households, measured by the November 2018 round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s survey, softened by 40 basis points for the three-month ahead horizon over the last round reflecting decline in food and petroleum product prices, while they remained unchanged for the twelve-month ahead horizon. Producers¡¯ assessment for input prices inflation eased marginally in Q3 as reported by manufacturing firms polled by the Reserve Bank¡¯s IOS. Domestic farm and industrial input costs remained high. Rural wage growth remained muted in Q2, while staff cost growth in the manufacturing sector remained elevated.The weighted average call rate (WACR) traded below the policy repo rate on 14 out of 21 days in October, on all 18 days in November and both days in December (December 3 and 4). The WACR traded below the repo rate on an average by 5 basis points in October, 9 basis points in November and 16 basis points in December. There was large currency expansion in October and especially during the festive season in November. Currency in circulation, however, contracted in each of the last three weeks in November. Liquidity needs arising from the growth in currency and the Reserve Bank¡¯s forex operations were met through a mixture of tools based on an assessment of the evolving liquidity conditions. The Reserve Bank injected durable liquidity amounting to _360 billion in October and _500 billion in November through open market purchase operations, bringing total durable liquidity injection to _1.36 trillion for 2018-19. Liquidity injected under the LAF, on an average daily net basis, was _560 billion in October, _806 billion in November and _105 billion in December (up to December 4).India¡¯s merchandise exports rebounded in October 2018, after moderating in the previous month, driven mainly by petroleum products, engineering goods, chemicals, electronics, readymade garments, and gems and jewellery. Imports also grew at a faster pace in October relative to the previous month, contributed mainly by petroleum products and electronic goods. Consequently, the trade deficit widened in October 2018 sequentially as also in comparison with the level a year ago. Provisional data suggest a modest improvement in net exports of services in Q2:2018-19, which augurs well for the current account balance. On the financing side, net FDI flows moderated in April-September 2018. Portfolio flows turned positive in November on account of a sharp decline in oil prices, indications of a less hawkish stance by the US Fed and a softer US dollar. However, during the year, there were net portfolio outflows of US$ 14.8 billion (up to November 30). Non-resident deposits increased markedly in H1:2018-19 on a net basis over their level a year ago. India¡¯s foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 393.7 billion on November 30, 2018."
other,"While the projections of inflation for 2018-19 and Q1:2019-20 have been revised downwards from the August resolution, its trajectory is projected to rise above the August 2018 print. The outlook is clouded with several uncertainties. First, the government announced in September measures aimed at ensuring remunerative prices to farmers for their produce, although uncertainty continues about their exact impact on food prices. Secondly, oil prices remain vulnerable to further upside pressures, especially if the response of oil-producing nations to supply disruptions from geopolitical tensions is not adequate. The recent excise duty cuts on petrol and diesel will moderate retail inflation. Thirdly, volatility in global financial markets continues to impart uncertainty to the inflation outlook. Fourthly, a sharp rise in input costs, combined with rising pricing power, poses the risk of higher pass-through to retail prices for both goods and services. Firms covered under the Reserve Bank¡¯s industrial outlook survey report firming of input costs in Q2:2018-19 and Q3. However, global commodity prices other than oil have moderated, which should mitigate the adverse influence on input costs. Fifthly, should there be fiscal slippage at the centre and/or state levels, it will have a bearing on the inflation outlook, besides heightening market volatility and crowding out private sector investment. Finally, the staggered impact of HRA revision by the state governments may push up headline inflation. While the MPC will look through the statistical impact of HRA revisions, there is need to be watchful for any second-round effects on inflation. The inflation outlook calls for a close vigil over the next few months, especially because the output gap has virtually closed and several upside risks persist. Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged. The MPC reiterates its commitment to achieving the medium-term target for headline inflation of 4 per cent on a durable basis.
The MPC notes that global headwinds in the form of escalating trade tensions, volatile and rising oil prices, and tightening of global financial conditions pose substantial risks to the growth and inflation outlook. It is, therefore, imperative to further strengthen domestic macroeconomic fundamentals.Regarding the policy repo rate, Dr. Pami Dua, Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Dr. Viral V. Acharya and Dr. Urjit R. Patel voted in favour of keeping the policy repo rate unchanged. Dr. Chetan Ghate voted for an increase in the policy rate by 25 bps.Regarding the stance, Dr. Pami Dua, Dr. Chetan Ghate, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Dr. Viral V. Acharya and Dr. Urjit R.

other,"Not all of the risks to the economy concern inflation. For example, a number of indicators point to a slowing in the housing market. Some cooling of the housing market is to be expected and would not be inconsistent with continued solid growth of overall economic activity. However, given the substantial gains in house prices and the high levels of home construction activity over the past several years, prices and construction could decelerate more rapidly than currently seems likely. Slower growth in home equity, in turn, might lead households to boost their saving and trim their spending relative to current income by more than is now anticipated. The possibility of significant further increases in energy prices represents an additional risk to the economy; besides affecting inflation, such increases might also hurt consumer confidence and thereby reduce spending on non-energy goods and services.Although the outlook contains significant uncertainties, it is clear that substantial progress has been made in removing monetary policy accommodation. As a consequence, in coming quarters the FOMC will have to make ongoing, provisional judgments about the risks to both inflation and growth, and monetary policy actions will be increasingly dependent on incoming data.In assessing the prospects for the economy, some appreciation of recent circumstances is essential, so let me now review key developments of 2005 and discuss their implications for the outlook. The household sector was a mainstay of the economic expansion again last year, and household spending is likely to remain an important source of growth in aggregate demand in 2006. The growth in household spending last year was supported by rising employment and moderate increases in wages. Expenditures were buoyed as well by significant gains in household wealth that reflected further increases in home values and in broad equity prices. However, sharply rising bills for gasoline and heating reduced the amount of income available for spending on other consumer goods and services."

While mining and electricity output surpassed March 2019 (pre-pandemic) levels, manufacturing did not catch up. The output of core industries registered a double digit y-o-y growth in April 2021, propelled by a weak base. Although GST collections were at their highest during April 2021, there are indications of moderation in May as reflected in lower E-way bills generation. Other high-frequency indicators _ electricity generation; railway freight traffic; port cargo; steel consumption; cement production; and toll collections _ recorded sequential moderation during April-May 2021, reflecting the impact of restrictions and localised lockdowns imposed by states with exemptions for specific activities. The manufacturing purchasing managers¡¯ index (PMI) remained in expansion in May although it moderated to 50.8 from 55.5 in April due to a slowdown in output and new orders. The services PMI, which was 54.0 in April, entered into contraction (46.4) in May, after seven months of sustained expansion.Headline inflation registered a moderation to 4.3 per cent in April from 5.5 per cent in March, largely on favourable base effects. Food inflation fell to 2.7 per cent in April from 5.2 per cent in March, with prices of cereals, vegetables and sugar continuing to decline on a y-o-y basis. While fuel inflation surged, core (CPI excluding food and fuel) inflation moderated in April across most sub-groups barring housing and health, mainly due to base effects.

earthquake,"Powerful earthquake shakes southern Mexico, at least 5 dead MEXICO CITY (AP) — A powerful earthquake centered near the southern Mexico resort of Huatulco on Tuesday killed at least five people, swayed buildings in Mexico City and sent thousands fleeing into the streets. Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said one person was killed in a building collapse in Huatulco, Oaxaca. Otherwise he said reports were of minor damage from the magnitude 7.4 quake, including broken windows and collapsed walls. Oaxaca Gov. Alejandro Murat said a second person was killed in an apparent house collapse in the mountain village of San Juan Ozolotepec and a third died in circumstances he did not explain. Federal civil defense authorities reported two more deaths: a worker at the state-run oil company, Pemex, fell to his death from a refinery structure, and a man died in the Oaxaca village of San Agustin Amatengo when a wall fell on him. Pemex also said the quake caused a fire at its refinery in the Pacific coast city of Salina Cruz, relatively near the epicenter. It said one worker was injured and the flames were quickly extinguished. Churches, bridges and highways also suffered damage during the quake. López Obrador said there had been more than 140 aftershocks, most of them small. Seismic alarms sounded midmorning with enough warning for residents to exit buildings. Power was knocked out to some areas. Helicopters flew over downtown Mexico City and police patrols sounded their sirens. Groups of people still milled around in close proximity on streets and sidewalks in some neighborhoods of the capital about an hour after the quake.

It took barely three hours of hard rain that day for a number of areas to be water-logged. Vehicles struggled to stay on ground and people afloat, suburban train services were suspended for a few hours when tracks were inundated, several bus routes were cancelled, and airport operations were severely disrupted.

Narasimha said the government had released funds to affected regions where a crippling shortage of rainfall had forced the rationing of drinking water to some communities.
As summer hits India, reports of families and farmers in remote villages walking long distances to find water after their wells dried up have dominated local media.
Narasimha gave the figures on Tuesday after an NGO filed a petition asking the top court to order Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government to step up relief to the hardest-hit areas.

Preliminary reports say the earthquake lasted 40 seconds, AFAD said, adding that 3,699 search and rescue personnel have been deployed.
Fifteen aftershocks have been felt in the wake, with the strongest registering at 5.4 magnitude, Soylu said. The quake struck at a relatively shallow depth of 10 km (6 miles), according to the US Geological Survey (USGS), which enhances the shaking felt at the surface.
About 500,000 people felt strong to very strong shaking, the USGS reported. The earthquake was felt in several other countries, including Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.
The quake interrupted a live broadcast of Edessa TV. Video of the broadcast shows four anchors talking while everything shakes around them.
All relevant departments were taking measures to ensure the safety of citizens following the earthquake, President Recep Tayyip Erdo?an said Saturday. Interior, health and environment ministers were sent to the quake-hit area."

Fueled by wind and dry conditions, the fire burning in El Dorado County swelled to 62,586 acres Wednesday and is 0% contained, according to Cal Fire. The fire was sparked Saturday and the cause is unknown.
""The unfortunate thing is that these fires continue to get bigger,"" Cal Fire Director Thom Porter said Wednesday at a news conference. ""But we're surging resources into communities to protect and reduce the impact.”
The fast-moving fire continued to burn through ""several steep drainages with the aid of the large amounts of dry vegetation,"" causing even more evacuations, Cal Fire said.
California's weather has only been making matters worse for those fighting the fires, as well as the thousands who were directed to evacuate their homes.
The state's large fires remained active Wednesday thanks to a front that pushed through the area, CNN meteorologist Michael Guy said. Although temperatures will remain on the cooler side, the area is still extremely dry as drought conditions continue to grip the state.
""Any new fronts that push through will increase the winds on approach, which can be a huge problem for the firefighters,"" Guy said. ""I would say it is like waiting for a wreck to happen. ... You see it happening or coming, and all you can do is wait for the catastrophe to occur with nothing you can do about it.”
To protect people from that dire situation, the number of those evacuated in El Dorado County jumped to 16,380 Wednesday, up from about 6,850 the day prior, according to the Governor's Office of Emergency Services.
""Getting people out of the way of these fires is the best way for us to be able to protect your communities. We need you to evacuate,"" Porter urged. ""Please heed the warnings.""
Darby Flynn is one of thousands who was told to flee the flames, CNN affiliate KCRA reported.
She told the news outlet she's ""glad to be able to evacuate and not be caught in the fire.""
""I just kind of grabbed some things and some important artwork that my mom painted for me and something my aunt made for me and that was pretty much it,"" she told KCRA. ""Otherwise, I just try to remember that things are things and most of them you can replace.""
Meanwhile, two people were airlifted to hospitals after being seriously injured in the area, Cal Fire said. One person approached firefighters, who tried conducting first aid before the person was taken to a hospital. Another person suffered ""severe"" injuries.
Damage assessment has not yet begun as the fire remains dynamic and complex, officials said. So far, the fire has destroyed many structures and threatens roughly 6,000 others, Cal Fire officials said. The fire burned at least one elementary school in the Pioneer Union School District, one community church and one post office.
In Lake County, California, about 100 miles northwest of Sacramento, a new wildfire has destroyed a number of homes, officials said. The Cache Fire has burned about 80 acres and is 20% contained, according to Cal Fire.
""Looks like we got several dozen homes that have been lost here, one civilian injury reported so far,"" Lake County Sheriff Brian Martin posted on Facebook on Wednesday. Evacuation orders had been issued for residents in the county."
other,"The outlook for inflation has turned adverse relative to expectations in the last two months. The substantial wedge between wholesale and retail inflation points to the supply-side bottlenecks and large margins being charged to the consumer. While cereal prices may continue to soften with the bumper kharif harvest arrivals and vegetable prices may ease with the winter crop, other food prices are likely to persist at elevated levels. Crude oil prices have picked up on optimism of demand recovery, continuation of OPEC plus production cuts and are expected to remain volatile in the near-term. Cost-push pressures continue to impinge on core inflation, which has remained sticky and could firm up as economic activity normalises and demand picks up. Taking into consideration all these factors, CPI inflation is projected at 6.8 per cent for Q3:2020-21, 5.8 per cent for Q4:2020-21; and 5.2 per cent to 4.6 per cent in H1:2021-22, with risks broadly balanced (Chart 1).Turning to the growth outlook, the recovery in rural demand is expected to strengthen further, while urban demand is also gaining momentum as unlocking spurs activity and employment, especially of labour displaced by COVID-19. These positive impulses are, however, clouded by a possible rise in infections in some parts of the country, prompting some local containment measures. At the same time, the recovery rate has crossed 94 per cent and there is considerable optimism on successes in vaccine trials. Consumers remain optimistic about the outlook, and business sentiment of manufacturing firms is gradually improving. Fiscal stimulus is increasingly moving beyond being supportive of consumption and liquidity to supporting growth-generating investment. On the other hand, private investment is still slack and capacity utilisation has not fully recovered. While exports are on an uneven recovery, the prospects have brightened with the progress on the vaccines. Demand for contact-intensive services is likely to remain subdued for some time due to social distancing norms and risk aversion. Taking these factors into consideration, real GDP growth is projected at (-)7.5 per cent in 2020-21: (+)0.1 per cent in Q3:2020-21 and (+)0.7 per cent in Q4:2020-21; and (+)21.9 per cent to (+)6.5 per cent in H1:2021-22, with risks broadly balanced (Chart 2).The MPC is of the view that inflation is likely to remain elevated, barring transient relief in the winter months from prices of perishables. This constrains monetary policy at the current juncture from using the space available to act in support of growth. At the same time, the signs of recovery are far from being broad-based and are dependent on sustained policy support. A small window is available for proactive supply management strategies to break the inflation spiral being fuelled by supply chain disruptions, excessive margins and indirect taxes. Further efforts are necessary to mitigate supply-side driven inflation pressures. Monetary policy will monitor closely all threats to price stability to anchor broader macroeconomic and financial stability. Accordingly, the MPC in its meeting today decided to maintain status quo on the policy rate and continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary _ at least during the current financial year and into the next financial year _ to revive growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward.All members of the MPC _ Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das _ unanimously voted for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged. Further, all members of the MPC voted unanimously to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary _ at least during the current financial year and into the next financial year _ to revive growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward."
wildfires,"lave Lake Mayor Karina Pillay-Kinnee said hundreds of firefighters converged on the town to help battle the blazes.
Emergency officials were knocking on doors on Tuesday to ensure all the town's 7,000 residents had evacuated.
No injuries or fatalities have been reported.
Alberta Municipal Affairs said the town's residents were ordered to evacuate on Sunday and that 95% of the town was empty by Monday, with only essential or firefighting staff remaining.
Devastating destruction
Alberta cabinet minister Thomas Lukaszuk said it was the largest single-day displacement of people in the province's history.
Ms Pillay-Kinnee, who toured Slave Lake on Monday afternoon, called the destruction in the town ""truly devastating"", adding that it would ""take a while to rebuild"".
""It's heart-wrenching as people lose their homes, their livelihood. For myself, I'm just trying to remain focused on the task at hand,"" Ms Pillay-Kinnee told the Calgary Herald newspaper.
Wildfires breached the town late on Sunday, reducing many homes and businesses to collapsed timber.
The government centre and library were destroyed by the blazes, while the police station and hospital remained unaffected.
By Monday evening, a blaze east of Slave Lake had consumed about 20 sq km (7.7 sq miles), and a fire south of the town had burned 150 sq km (57.9 sq miles).
More than 100 wildfires were burning in Alberta as of Monday, and roughly 40 of those fires were considered out of control, local media reported.
Fires forced oil companies in Alberta, the country's largest energy producing province, to shut off thousands of barrels of output.
The Canadian government has deployed 1,000 firefighters, 100 helicopters and 20 water bombers to battle wildfires throughout the entire province."
other,"The Reserve Bank¡¯s liquidity framework was changed significantly in September 2014 in order to implement key recommendations of the Expert Committee to Revise and Strengthen the Monetary Policy Framework (Chairman: Dr. Urjit R Patel). With over six quarters of implementation history, it is appropriate to review the experience, with a view to making necessary adjustments as well as to more fully implement the report of the Expert Committee.Liquidity management is driven by two objectives: first, the need to supply or withdraw short term liquidity from the market so as to accommodate seasonal and frictional liquidity needs such as the build-up of Government balances and demand for cash; and second, the need to supply durable liquidity in the economy so as to facilitate growth, while ensuring that the monetary policy stance is supported.The Reserve Bank has kept the system in an ex ante deficit mode on average, with a liquidity shortfall equivalent to one per cent of banks¡¯ NDTL. The rationale has been that the banking system would borrow from the Reserve Bank¡¯s liquidity facilities, ensuring that the repo rate guided short term money market rates and thereby was effective as the policy rate.The first objective of meeting short term liquidity needs has been accomplished through the provision of liquidity by the Reserve Bank under its regular facilities - variable rate 14-day/7-day repo auctions equivalent to 0.75 per cent of banking system NDTL, supplemented by daily overnight fixed rate repos (at the repo rate) equivalent to 0.25 per cent of bank-wise NDTL. Frictional and seasonal mismatches that move the system away from normal liquidity provision are addressed through fine-tuning operations, including variable rate repo/reverse repo auctions of varying tenors. The weighted average call money rate has tracked the policy rate more closely than in the past, suggesting that short term liquidity needs have been adequately met."
other,"Marking the fifth consecutive month of softening, retail inflation measured by the headline consumer price index (CPI) turned down sharper than expected in December and reached its lowest reading since November 2014. This outcome was driven by deflation in the prices of vegetables and pulses. Some moderation in the rate of increase in prices of protein-rich items _ eggs, meat and fish _ also aided the downturn in food inflation.Excluding food and fuel, inflation has been unyielding at 4.9 per cent since September. While some part of this inertial behaviour is attributable to the turnaround in international crude prices since October _ which fed into prices of petrol and diesel embedded in transport and communication _ a broad-based stickiness is discernible in inflation, particularly in housing, health, education, personal care and effects (excluding gold and silver) as well as miscellaneous goods and services consumed by households.The large overhang of liquidity consequent upon demonetisation weighed on money markets in December, but from mid-January rebalancing has been underway with expansion of currency in circulation and new bank notes being injected into the system at an accelerated pace. Throughout this period, the Reserve Bank¡¯s market operations have been in liquidity absorption mode. With the abolition of the incremental cash reserve ratio from December 10, liquidity management operations have consisted of variable rate reverse repos under the LAF of tenors ranging from overnight to 91 days and auctions of cash management bills under the market stabilisation scheme (MSS) of tenors ranging from 14 to 63 days. The average daily net absorption under the LAF was _ 1.6 trillion in December, _ 2.0 trillion in January and _ 3.7 trillion in February (up to February 7) while under the MSS, it was _ 3.8 trillion, _ 5.0 trillion and _ 2.9 trillion, respectively. Money market rates remained aligned with the policy repo rate albeit with a soft bias, with the weighted average call money rate (WACR) averaging 18 basis points below the policy rate during December and January.Turning to the external sector, export growth remained in the positive zone for the fourth month in succession in December. Imports other than petroleum oil and lubricants (POL) came out of the spike in November and moderated in December. In contrast, there was an increase of over 10 per cent in POL imports, in part reflecting the rise in international crude oil prices. Overall, the trade deficit shrank both sequentially and on a year-on-year basis, being lower for the period April-December by US$ 23.5 billion than its level a year ago. On the whole, the current account deficit is likely to remain muted and below 1 per cent of GDP in 2016-17. While the buoyancy in net foreign direct investment was sustained, there have been portfolio outflows beginning October on uncertainty relating to the direction of US macroeconomic policies and expectations of faster normalisation of US monetary policy in the year ahead. Foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 363.1 billion on February 3, 2017."
earthquake,"Large earthquake off Alaska prompts tsunami fears, fleeing A magnitude 7.5 earthquake prompted a tsunami warning Monday for a nearly thousand-mile stretch of Alaska’s southern coast, with waves over 2 feet at the nearest community as the threat subsided. The quake was centered near Sand Point, a city of about 900 people off the Alaska Peninsula where wave levels late Monday topped 2 feet (0.61 meters), according to the National Tsunami Warning Center. The warning was downgraded to an advisory just over two hours after the quake hit. “It was a pretty good shaker here,” said David Adams, co-manager of Marine View Bed and Breakfast in Sand Point. “You could see the water kind of shaking and shimmering during the quake. Our truck was swaying big time.” Adams didn’t take any photos or video: “It just kind of happened all of a sudden.” The quake struck in the North Pacific Ocean just before 1 p.m. It was centered about 67 miles (118 kilometers) southeast of Sand Point, according to the Alaska Earthquake Center. The community is about 800 miles (1,288 km) southwest of Anchorage. The quake was recorded at a depth of 19 miles (30 kilometers). The National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, Alaska, said the tsunami warning — and later advisory — was in effect for roughly 950 miles (1,529 kilometers), from 40 miles (64 kilometers) southeast of Homer to Unimak Pass, about 80 miles (129 km) northeast of Unalaska. The quake was felt widely in communities along the southern coast, including Sand Point, Chignik, Unalaska and the Kenai Peninsula, according to the Alaska Earthquake Center, which said a magnitude 5.2 aftershock was reported 11 minutes later, centered roughly in the same area. Patrick Mayer, superintendent of the Aleutians East Borough School District, said parents picked up their children from Sand Point School, which also served an evacuation point. The earthquake was felt to varying degrees at the other four schools in the district, the closest of which is 90 miles away, he said. Mayer said a school bus was dispatched to a fish processing facility to bring workers to the school since it’s on high ground. The workers were to wear masks to protect against the spread of the coronavirus, he said, in a community where there have been only “limited cases.” Public safety officials in King Cove urged residents to remain vigilant after the warning was downgraded and to stay off the beach and out of harbors and marinas. Waves by late afternoon in King Cove were less than 2 feet (0.61 meters), according to the National Tsunami Warning Center. The size of the quake was originally reported to have been a magnitude of 7.4, but was revised to a 7.5, said Paul Caruso, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey. He said an earthquake of this size, in this area, is not a surprise. “This is an area where the Pacific Plate is subducting underneath the North American Plate. And because of that, the Pacific Plate actually goes underneath the North American Plate, where it melts,” Caruso said, noting that’s why there are volcanoes in the region. “And so we commonly have large, magnitude 7 earthquakes in that area.”"
other,"Global growth is projected to pick up modestly in 2017, after slowing down in the year gone by. Advanced economies (AEs) are expected to build upon the slow gathering of momentum that started in the second half of 2016, led by the US and Japan. However, uncertainty surrounds the direction of US macroeconomic policies with potential global spillovers. Growth prospects for emerging market economies (EMEs) are also expected to improve moderately, with recessionary conditions ebbing in Russia and Brazil, and China stabilising on policy stimulus. Inflation is edging up on the back of rising energy prices and a mild firming up of demand. However, global trade remains subdued due to an increasing tendency towards protectionist policies and heightened political tensions. Furthermore, financial conditions are likely to tighten as central banks in AEs normalise exceptional accommodation in monetary policy.International financial markets turned volatile from mid-January on concerns regarding the ¡®Brexit¡¯ roadmap and materialisation of expectations about economic policies of the new US administration. Within the rising profile of international commodity prices, crude oil prices firmed up with the OPEC¡¯s agreement to curtail production. Prices of base metals have also increased on expectations of fiscal stimulus in the US, strong infrastructure spending in China, and supply reductions. Geopolitical concerns have also hardened commodity prices. More recently, the appetite for risk has returned in AEs, buoying equity markets and hardening bond yields as a response to the growing likelihood of further increases in the Federal Funds rate during the year. Coupled with expectations of fiscal expansion in the US, this has propelled the US dollar to a multi-year high."
earthquake,"Mass evacuations as large quakes spark Pacific-wide tsunami alert WELLINGTON: Tens of thousands of coastal residents in New Zealand, New Caledonia and Vanuatu fled for higher ground on Friday (Mar 5) as a cluster of powerful earthquakes sparked a Pacific-wide tsunami alert. Warning sirens sounded across Noumea as authorities ordered evacuations amid fears that waves of up to 3m were headed towards the French territory. ""People must leave beach areas and stop all water activities, and should not pick their children up at schools to avoid creating traffic jams,"" emergency services spokesman Alexandre Rosignol told public radio. In New Zealand, communities along stretches of the North Island were warned to flee as tsunami alert sirens wailed after an 8.1-magnitude quake, which followed earlier tremors in the same region measuring 7.4 and 7.2."
earthquake,"The most-powerful earthquake in Japan's recorded history struck off the country's northeast coast on Friday, leaving hundreds of people dead, injured or missing.
The 8.9-magnitude earthquake triggered a deadly tsunami that washed far inland, swamping towns, sweeping away a train and sparking massive fires that burned through the night.
The exact death toll was not immediately clear, but there were reports that 200 to 300 bodies were found in the northeastern coastal city of Sendai alone. Another 547 are missing and 798 people were injured, police said.
Kaoru Ishikawa, the Japanese ambassador to Canada, told CBC News that officials haven't determined how many people had died after the devastating quake and tsunami.
""We are trying indeed to check what's going on, but unfortunately the scope of the casualties we don't know yet,"" he said.
Local media are reporting that the death toll is expected to climb and could pass 1,000.

wildfires,"The summer of 2015 was unlike anything most career firefighters had ever seen. Across the United States, fires erupted not only in dry woodlands, but also in grasslands, rainforests, and tundra, ignited by lightning strikes and careless campers. Flames dripped from lichen-covered trees in the Pacific Northwest, and in Alaska, ate into permafrost. Two hundred. U.S. military personnel were called in to battle the ferocious blazes across the West — as were Canadians, Australians, and New Zealanders.
By year’s end, wildfires would consume more than 10.1 million acres of land in the U.S., destroying 4,500 homes and taking the lives of 13 wildland firefighters. Fighting the blazes cost an unprecedented $2.6 billion, the majority spent in the West. ""While the news that more than 10 million acres burned is terrible, it's not shocking, and it is probable that records will continue to be broken,” said Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack in a press release last week. 
The burned acreage surpasses the 2006 record of 9.9 million acres, which itself was the biggest year documented since modern record keeping began in 1960 (during the 1920s through 1940s, burned acreage averaged 30 million to 50 million acres). Though more than 68,000 fires flared this summer, it was ultimately Alaska that put 2015 into the record books. More than 5.1 million acres burned up north, the state’s second largest fire season after 2004.
“This year we had fires occurring from the Canadian border over by Northway, on the Alaskan Highway, all the way out to the Lower Kuskokwim River, almost to Bethel, which drops into the Bering Sea, all at the same time,” says Kent Slaughter, manager of the Alaska Fire Service, noting though this season wasn’t the largest, fires were more widespread. 
Because Alaska’s fire season typically has a head start on the Lower 48, the state’s fire managers are able to call on the rest of the nation for crews and tankers. Still, resources are finite, says Ken Frederick, spokesman for the National Interagency Fire Center.
“There’s only 30 to 40 large air tankers in the system, 110 hotshot crews, and around 400 smokejumpers — when everything is busy, very quickly all resources are committed … and not everything can be supplied,” he says.
Due to the state’s remote, rugged terrain, firefighting in Alaska can be especially expensive. “They require a lot of aircraft and they have less infrastructure to get to fires,” Frederick explains."

The 6.2-magnitude earthquake struck on Friday morning, just hours after an earlier, smaller tremor. Hundreds of people were injured and thousands displaced by the quake. Indonesia has a history of devastating earthquakes and tsunamis, with more than 2,000 killed in a 2018 Sulawesi quake. Eight people died when the five-storey Mitra Manakarra Hospital in Mamuju partially collapsed on Friday, officials said. About 60 people were safely evacuated from the hospital. ""It happened so quickly, around 10 seconds,"" Syamsu Ridwan, a local police spokesman, told the BBC. He said the power in the hospital cut out during the earthquake. Officials fear the death toll will increase as rescue efforts continue. Rescuers were still searching for survivors late on Friday, but they have been hampered by power cuts and poor mobile phone service. Indonesian President Joko Widodo offered condolences to the victims, urging people to stay calm and for the authorities to step up search efforts."
other,"In recent years the Federal Reserve has also substantially increased the information it provides about its operations and its balance sheet. In particular, for some time the Federal Reserve has been voluntarily providing extensive financial and operational information regarding the special credit and liquidity facilities put in place during the financial crisis, including full descriptions of the terms and conditions of each facility; monthly reports on, among other things, the types of collateral posted and the mix of participants using each facility; weekly updates about borrowings and repayments at each facility; and many other details.7 Further, on December 1, as provided by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the Federal Reserve Board posted on its public website the details of more than 21,000 individual credit and other transactions conducted to stabilize markets and support the economic recovery during the crisis. This transaction-level information demonstrated the breadth of these operations and the care that was taken to protect the interests of the taxpayer; indeed, despite the scope of these actions, the Federal Reserve has incurred no credit losses to date on any of the programs and expects no credit losses in any of the few programs that still have loans outstanding. Moreover, we are fully confident that independent assessments of these programs will show that they were highly effective in helping to stabilize financial markets, thus strengthening the economy. Overall, the operational effectiveness of the programs was recently supported as part of a comprehensive review of six lending facilities by the Board's independent Office of Inspector General.8 In addition, we have been working closely with the Government Accountability Office, the Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the Congressional Oversight Panel, the Congress, and private-sector auditors on reviews of these facilities as well as a range of matters relating to the Federal Reserve's operations and governance. We will continue to seek ways of enhancing our transparency without compromising our ability to conduct policy in the public interest."

Mr Morrison warned of more rain and days of danger to come as the emergency became not ""just a coastal event""."
drought,"Nearly 25 percent of the world’s malnourished population lives in sub-Saharan Africa, where more than 300 million people depend on corn, or maize, as their main food source. Maize is the most widely harvested agricultural product in Africa and is grown by small farmers who rely heavily on rainwater rather than irrigation. The crop is therefore extremely sensitive to drought, and since 2015 its production has fallen dramatically as a result of record-setting drought conditions across southern and eastern Africa. 
Now MIT scientists have found that climate change will likely further worsen drought conditions in parts of the continent, dramatically reshaping the production of maize throughout sub-Saharan Africa as global temperatures rise over the next century.
In a paper published online this week in the journal Earth’s Future, the researchers report that, if the world’s average temperatures rise by 4 degrees Celsius by the year 2100, much of southern Africa and the Sahel region just south of the Sahara desert — regions that contribute a significant portion of Africa’s maize production — will experience increased aridity, which in turn is predicted to decrease maize crop yields in some nations by over 20 percent.
“[Maize] is a relatively drought-sensitive crop in a region where agricultural production is mostly rainfed,” says lead author Amy Dale, a postdoc in MIT’s Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS). “If under climate change we have changes in temperature and precipitation, this is arguably one of the worst areas of the world where we’re going to see really negative impacts on crop production and malnourished populations.”
The researchers’ analysis also shows that climate change’s impact is less certain for the most arid regions of sub-Saharan Africa including the semiarid regions that produce over 40 percent of sub-Saharan African maize."
other,"The Australian economy is expected to expand at a solid pace over the next couple of years, and labour market developments have been quite positive of late. The drag on growth from the end of the mining investment boom has eased and is likely to end sometime in the next year or so. Investment in the non-mining sector has been increasing but growth in consumption has been below average. Inflation and wage growth remain low. Both are expected to increase only gradually over time.A number of factors are serving to hold inflation down. Wage growth has remained low and strong competition in the retail sector is dampening retail inflation across a broad range of goods. Although the unemployment rate has declined and is expected to fall further, some spare capacity is likely to remain in the labour market in the period ahead. It is also likely that structural factors and the adjustment following the terms of trade boom have been working to contain wage growth. Stronger labour market conditions are nonetheless expected to lead to a pick-up in wage growth over time. Important uncertainties influencing the outlook for inflation include the questions of how much wage growth might pick up as the labour market tightens, and how quickly the resulting increase in labour costs might feed into inflation."

For the past six months in Madagascar, men, women, the elderly and children have been dying of hunger.

The process of setting the BI7DRR to achieving the inflation target is transmitted through various channels with a time lag. Adjusting the BI7DRR to influence inflation is known as the monetary policy transmission mechanism.  This mechanism shows how Bank Indonesia policy, through adjustments to monetary instruments and the operational target, influences various economic and financial variables before ultimately affecting inflation.  The mechanism works through interactions between the central bank, banking industry and financial sector, as well as the real sector.  Adjustments to the BI7DRR influence inflation through various channels, including the interest rate channel, credit channel, exchange rate channel, asset price channel and expectations channel.. In terms of the interest rate channel, adjustments to the BI7DRR influence deposit rates and lending rates in the banking industry.  Bank Indonesia can utilise tight-bias monetary policy by raising interest rates, which impacts aggregate demand and alleviates inflationary pressures.  In contrast, reducing the BI7DRR will lower lending rates thus increasing corporate and household demand for loans.  In addition, lower lending rates also reduce the cost of capital for investment in the corporate sector, thus stoking consumption and investment activity and stimulating the economy.."
earthquake,"An intermediate magnitude 5.2 earthquake was reported in the evening near Madang, Madang Province, Papua New Guinea.
According to Indonesia's Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysical Agency, the quake hit on Thursday 13 May 2021 at 9:32 pm local time at an intermediate depth of 72 km. The exact magnitude, epicenter, and depth of the quake might be revised within the next few hours or minutes as seismologists review data and refine their calculations, or as other agencies issue their report.
Our monitoring service identified a second report from the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) which listed the quake at magnitude 5.2 as well. A third agency, the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ), reported the same quake at magnitude 5.0.
Based on the preliminary seismic data, the quake should not have caused any significant damage, but was probably felt by many people as light vibration in the area of the epicenter.
Weak shaking might have been felt in Goroka (pop. 18,500) located 39 km from the epicenter, Madang (pop. 27,400) 69 km away, and Kainantu (pop. 8,500) 77 km away.
VolcanoDiscovery will automatically update magnitude and depth if these change and follow up if other significant news about the quake become available. If you're in the area, please send us your experience through our reporting mechanism, either online or via our mobile app. This will help us provide more first-hand updates to anyone around the globe who wants to know more about this quake."

earthquake,"Thousands flee for safety and higher ground after island’s second quake in 24 hours
At least 37 people have been killed and hundreds injured following a strong earthquake that shook the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia early on Friday morning, prompting landslides and destroying houses.
Thousands of people fled their homes to seek safety when the 6.2-magnitude earthquake hit just after 1am local time on Friday morning. The epicentre was 6km north-east of Majene city in West Sulawesi.
Hundreds of buildings were destroyed or damaged, including a hospital, which collapsed with more than a dozen patients and staff trapped beneath it.
“The hospital is flattened,” said Arianto, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, from the rescue agency in Mamuju city, near Majene. Rescuers were also trying to reach a family of eight buried beneath the rubble of their destroyed home, he told AFP.
At least 37 people have been killed in Majene and Mamuju, and rescue workers fear the death toll will rise further. “Many of the dead are buried under rubble,” said Ali Rahman, the head of the local disaster mitigation agency in Mamuju. In Majene, 637 people were said to be injured."
other,"he House passed a bill Tuesday increasing the power of the federal government and racial minorities to block or challenge election rules they find discriminatory.
Democrats named the legislation the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancements Act after the civil rights icon and longtime Georgia congressman who died last year.
""John knew that the fight for justice never truly ends,"" tweeted Democratic Rep. Terri Sewell of Alabama. ""Each generation must fight & fight again to preserve the progress of the past and advance it. Now it's our turn.""
The bill would restore an aspect of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that allowed the Justice Department to block certain jurisdictions with a history of voter discrimination from changing their voting rules, after conservative justices on the Supreme Court ruled in 2013's Shelby County v. Holder that the formula used was outdated. Attorney General Merrick Garland recently wrote in The Washington Post that the Voting Rights Act's ""preclearance"" provision was ""enormously effective"" and led to ""thousands of discriminatory voting changes that would have curtailed the voting rights of millions of citizens in jurisdictions large and small.""
The bill also responds to the Supreme Court's 6-3 decision this year in Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee, which limited the ability of minorities to challenge state laws that they say are discriminatory under a different section of the Voting Rights Act.
The bill faces a steep climb in the Senate, where the vast majority of Republicans oppose it, calling the legislation a massive federal overreach into the states' role in elections. At this point, Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski is the only Senate Republican expected to support the bill.
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in June that the bill is ""unnecessary"" since ""it's against the law to discriminate in voting on the basis of race already,"" although the legislation would allow the Justice Department to block a law before it comes into effect.
McConnell said the bill would ""grant to the Justice Department almost total ability to determine the voting systems of every state in America."""
wildfires,"Firefighters in steep terrain and rugged conditions in California are fighting nearly two dozen wildfires that have torched more than 134,000 acres, according to state fire officials.
That's nearly three times the state's 5-year wildfire average of 48,153 acres for this time of year, according to statistics posted by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire.
At 60,000 acres, the Rocky Fire is the largest ongoing blaze. It's led to evacuation orders for more than 13,000 people as it feeds on drought-parched vegetation that hasn't seen fire in many years, according to Cal Fire.
The fire, which is in Lake, Yolo and Colusa counties northwest of Sacramento, was 12% contained, the agency said.
""This has been a very fast-moving wildfire, with the dry conditions and the weather not really cooperating with us over the past week,"" Cal Fire spokesman Daniel Berlant told CNN affiliate KCRA.
More than 2,900 firefighters, 285 engines, four air tankers and 19 helicopters are involved in that fight, Cal Fire says.
Compared with the state's top 20 deadliest fires, which have burned 100,000 acres or more of land, ""this fire does not compare,"" spokesman Berlant told CNN.
But the fire is unique because of the rate it has burned. It chewed through 20,000 acres in about five hours, he said.
Across the state, nearly 10,000 firefighters are working on 21 fires, officials say."
earthquake,"Many residents of the Southern Zone didn’t need an alarm to wake up early on Friday morning.
A magnitude 6.0 earthquake shook southern Costa Rica and northern Panama at 6:41 a.m., the Volcanological and Seismological Observatory of Costa Rica (OVSICORI) said.
The epicenter was estimated at 37.6 km southwest of Puerto Armuelles, Panama.
The National Emergency Commission (CNE) has not reported any damages in Costa Rica. The earthquake was felt throughout the Southern Zone and in the city of David, Panama, OVSICORI said.
“This is an earthquake that occurs in a region where three tectonic plates interact: the Cocos plate, the Nazca plate, and the Panama plate,” an OVSICORI spokesperson said.
OVSICORI reported several smaller aftershocks throughout Friday morning.
Costa Rica averages 350 earthquakes each month — about 12 each day — though most are imperceptible."
valcano eruption,"Volcano erupts in eastern Congo, thousands flee Goma GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) -Lava from a volcanic eruption approached the airport of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo's main city of Goma late on Saturday, and the government urged residents to evacuate. As the red glow of Mount Nyiragongo tinged the night sky above the lakeside city of about 2 million, thousands of Goma residents carrying mattresses and other belongings fled the city on foot - many toward the frontier with Rwanda."
other,"High frequency indicators of service sector activity showed a mixed picture in September-October. Growth in tractors sales _ an indicator of rural demand _ turned negative in September. Growth in two-wheeler sales, another indicator of rural demand, rebounded in October, supported by a base effect. Growth in passenger vehicles sales _ an indicator of urban demand _ turned marginally positive in October, after three consecutive months of negative growth coincident with changes in mandatory long-term third-party insurance requirements and a sharp increase in fuel prices. Commercial vehicle sales growth remained robust in September-October, despite some deceleration. Railway freight traffic improved markedly in October to touch a five-year high growth. While domestic air passenger traffic sustained robust growth, international passenger traffic contracted. PMI for services registered a sharp uptick in November, driven by new business. The composite PMI output index touched a two-year high of 54.5 in November.Retail inflation, measured by y-o-y change in CPI, declined from 3.7 per cent in September to 3.3 per cent in October. A large fall in food prices pushed food group into deflation and more than offset the increase in inflation in items excluding food and fuel. Adjusting for the estimated impact of an increase in house rent allowance (HRA) for central government employees, headline inflation was 3.1 per cent in October.Within the food and beverages group, deflation in vegetables, pulses and sugar deepened in October. Among other items, there was a broad-based softening across food items, especially cereals, milk, fruits and prepared meals. Milk and milk products inflation softened caused by surplus supplies in the domestic market. Fruits inflation moderated, while prepared meals registered a price decline for the first time in the CPI series. Inflation, however, showed an uptick in meat and fish, and non-alcoholic beverages.Inflation in the fuel and light group remained elevated, driven by liquefied petroleum gas prices in October, tracking international petroleum product prices. Kerosene prices also edged up, reflecting the calibrated increase in their administered price. However, electricity prices softened in October. Inflation in rural fuel items such as firewood and chips and dung cake also moderated."
wildfires,"A fire in Swinley Forest near Bracknell has become the largest in Berkshire's history, according to fire chiefs.
Olaf Baars, deputy chief fire officer, said that in terms of resources deployed it has exceeded the scale of the 1992 Windsor Castle fire.
Mr Baars said however, he believed the fire, which is affecting 300 hectares of forest, would soon be contained.
Although smaller than other wildfires burning in the UK, it is the only one close to a built-up area, he added.
The fire is also burning close to the high-security Broadmoor Hospital.
Two teenagers have been bailed after they were arrested on suspicion of arson by police investigating the fire.
Thames Valley Police said the arrests of the boys, both 14, were ""not necessarily linked"" to the fires in the forest."
other,"The global economic recovery slackened in Q4 (October-December) of 2020 relative to Q3 (July-September) as several countries battle second waves of COVID-19 infections, including more virulent strains. With massive vaccination drives underway, risks to the recovery may abate and economic activity is expected to gain momentum in the second half of 2021. In its January 2021 update, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised upward its estimate of global growth in 2020 to (-)3.5 per cent from (-)4.4 per cent and increased the projection of global growth for 2021 by 30 basis points to 5.5 per cent. Barring some emerging market economies, inflation remains benign on weak aggregate demand, although rising commodity prices carry upside risks. Financial markets remain buoyant, supported by easy monetary conditions, abundant liquidity and optimism from the vaccine rollout. Global trade is also expected to rebound in 2021, with services trade on a slower recovery than merchandise trade."
other,"The Central Statistics Office (CSO) released its advance estimates for 2016-17 on January 6, placing India¡¯s real GVA growth at 7.0 per cent for the year, down from 7.8 per cent (first revised estimates released on January 31) a year ago. Agriculture and allied activities posted a strong pick-up, benefiting from the normal south-west monsoon, robust expansion in rabi acreage (higher by 5.7 per cent over the preceding year) and favourable base effects as well as the continuing resilience of allied activities. In contrast, the industrial sector experienced a sharp deceleration, mainly due to a slowdown in manufacturing and in mining and quarrying. Service sector activity also lost pace, concentrated in trade, hotels, transport and communication services, and construction, cushioned to some extent by public administration and defence.Industrial output measured by the index of industrial production (IIP) finally shrugged off the debilitating drag from insulated rubber cables from November and was also pushed up by a favourable base effect. In December, the output of core industries accelerated on a year-on-year as well as on a sequentially seasonally adjusted basis. The drivers of the upturn were steel production and petroleum refinery throughput, the former, inter alia, supported by import tariff safeguards and the latter buoyed by external demand. The acceleration in coal production and thermal electricity generation since November after three consecutive months of contraction augur well for the outlook for power. Reflecting these developments, the manufacturing purchasing managers¡¯ index (PMI) returned to expansion mode in January on the back of growth of new orders and output, and the future output index has risen strongly. On the other hand, the 76th round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s industrial outlook survey suggests that financing conditions facing the manufacturing sector have worsened in Q3 of 2016-17 and are expected to remain tight in Q4. This is corroborated by the sharp slowdown in bank credit to industry and continuing sluggishness in the investment climate in some sectors.High frequency indicators point to subdued activity in the services sector, particularly automobile sales across all segments, domestic air cargo, railway freight traffic, and cement production. Nevertheless, some areas stand out as bright spots, having weathered the transient effects of demonetisation _ steel consumption; port traffic; international air freight; foreign tourist arrivals; tractor sales; and, cellular telephone subscribers. The services PMI for January 2017 remained in retrenchment, but the fall in output was the least in the current phase of three consecutive months of contraction."

The decision was taken amidst easing external and domestic inflationary pressures, and a weakening global economic environment. Since the last policy review, the S$NEER (Chart 1) has largely fluctuated in the lower half of the policy band.  This reflected a number of factors, including the general strength of the US$, continued risk aversion by global investors and the erosion in domestic economic conditions.  With the fall in global interest rates, the domestic three-month interbank rate also declined, from 1.88% in September 2008 to 0.69% at end-March 2009."

other,"The United States has vowed to continue the evacuation of American citizens and allies out of Afghanistan, as US troops brace for the threat of more terrorist attacks following two deadly bombings at Kabul's airport.
At least 90 Afghans died and another 140 were injured Thursday, an official with Afghanistan's Ministry of Health said, after suicide bombers and gunmen attacked packed crowds outside the airport.
According to the Pentagon, 13 US service members were killed and 18 others injured.
Ten Marines were among the troops killed and several more were wounded, Marine spokesman Maj. Jim Stenger said. The identities and units of those killed won't be announced until after relatives are notified, he added.
The assault came as the US and other Western countries were racing to evacuate their citizens and Afghan allies ahead of an August 31 deadline, after the Taliban retook control of the country.
Thousands of Afghans had been gathering at the airport's gates in recent days in hopes of being evacuated. Footage posted to social media on Thursday after the explosions showed chaotic scenes of crowds trying to help the wounded amid bodies on the ground. Photos showed bloodied people being transported away from the scene in wheelbarrows.
Video shot by local Afghan journalists in the wake of the blasts, appears to show people continuing to gather near the airport perimeter despite the enormous personal risk.
ISIS in Khorasan, known as ISIS-K has claimed responsibility for the attack, but provided no evidence to support the claim. US officials have said the group was likely behind the atrocity.
Speaking from the White House, US President Joe Biden said evacuation efforts would not be stopped by the attack, and that he had ordered US military commanders to develop plans to strike ""ISIS-K assets, leadership and facilities.""
""We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay,"" Biden said.
About 7,500 people were evacuated from Kabul over the course of 12 hours between 3 a.m. and 3. p.m. ET on Thursday, the White House said. It's unclear how many of those evacuations took place after the attack."
drought,"The scene is now common throughout eastern and southern Africa, as droughts for three consecutive years have decimated crops and caused widespread hunger. New research indicates that it is partly due to climate change driven by human action, which has worsened the El Niño weather phenomenon.
“This is about as bad as it has ever been,” said Chris Harvey, as he walked to his farm´s irrigation dam, where the water level has fallen six metres in 10 months.
“We might not be able to grow any vegetables next year,” his wife Sue added.
Dams in the area are drying out, symptomatic of the continent´s battle with years of poor rainfall. The droughts in eastern and southern Africa beginning in 2015 have affected tens of millions of people. The latest numbers from the UN suggest that 24 million people are facing food insecurity in eastern Africa alone, not counting millions of people in the southern region.
According to a new study published by the American Meteorological Society, such conditions will become increasingly normal as climate change takes its toll.
“We are advising governments to expect yearly disasters, droughts, floods, and also now diseases,” David Phiri, the UN´s food and agriculture coordinator in Southern Africa, told IRIN."
other,"Since the MPR of October 2017, global economic activity has gained strength, with growth impulses becoming synchronised across regions. Global trade has expanded, buoyed by gradually improving global demand and especially, the revival of investment activity in advanced economies (AEs). Crude prices have firmed up on strong demand and geo-political concerns, necessitating the drawdown of inventories even as production cuts by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) restrain supply. Metal prices have risen, fuelled by demandsupply imbalances and resurgent demand as economic prospects improve. Inflation has remained below target levels in most AEs despite the pick-up in aggregate demand and rise in some commodity prices, while it remains subdued in most emerging market economies (EMEs).International financial markets, which were buoyed by reflation trade and remained resilient to the normalisation of monetary policy by the US Fed during Q4:2017 and January 2018, turned volatile beginning the first week of February on (i) strong payrolls and accelerated wage growth data in the US fuelling expectations of faster tightening of monetary policy; (ii) announcement of protectionist trade measures by the US and retaliatory talk; and (iii) uncertainty surrounding the Brexit transition deal. Equity markets in advanced and emerging market economies, which had rallied in H2:2017, shed some of their gains in Q1:2018. Bond yields in major AEs hardened on expectations of faster monetary policy normalisation and rise in inflation in some AEs. The US dollar remained weak, while the euro and the yen appreciated. EME currencies behaved divergently with a general appreciating bias until January 2018."
drought,"Nestle extracted 36 million gallons of water from a national forest in California last year to sell as bottled water, even as Californians were ordered to cut their water use because of a historic drought in the state.
And the permit that Nestle uses to operate its water pipeline in the San Bernardino national forest costs just $524 (£357) a year.
That rankles with some residents and environmental groups, who want the US government to cut off Nestle's access to the water until an environmental study can be conducted.
Nestle has the legal rights to the water, and Arrowhead water has been bottled from springs here since 1894.
Yet the firm's permit to operate this seven-mile pipeline in the mountains expired in 1988, though since it pays its yearly $524, the licence is still considered valid by the US Forest Service and by Nestle.
However, activists consider the permit expired and the US government is now reviewing Nestle's licence. A public comment period has just closed and this month a federal hearing will consider the legality of the permit.
""The forest service should protect the forest,"" says Amanda Frye, a resident who's becoming known as a water rights activist. ""A healthy forest produces a healthy population of people. We need the forest."""
earthquake,"An earthquake of 5.4 magnitude hit Sikkim on Monday night, the National Centre for Seismology said, with tremors being also felt in the eastern states of Assam, West Bengal and Bihar.
The quake occurred at 8.49 PM at a depth of 10 kilometres near the India-Bhutan border, the NCS said.
In Sikkim, panic-stricken people rushed out of their houses. There was no immediate report of any major damage.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to the chief ministers of Sikkiam, Bihar and Assam and took stock of the situation in eastern India following the quake, government sources said.
""PM Narendra Modi is taking stock of the damage due to the earthquake. He is speaking to chief ministers of all 4 affected states and has already spoken to the CMs of Bihar, Assam and Sikkim,"" the sources said.
West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar said that he called up Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and enquired about her well-being as she is in Siliguri, where the tremors were felt.
""Had telephone conversation @MamataOfficial to enquire her well-being as Earthquake Tremors Felt In North Bengal. Hon'ble CM is at Siliguri presently. Relieved to learn all well at her end,"" he tweeted.

other,"While indicators of spending and production have been encouraging on balance, the job market has improved only slowly. Following the loss of about 8-3/4 million jobs from early 2008 through 2009, private-sector employment expanded by only a little more than 1 million during 2010, a gain barely sufficient to accommodate the inflow of recent graduates and other entrants to the labor force. We do see some grounds for optimism about the job market over the next few quarters, including notable declines in the unemployment rate in December and January, a drop in new claims for unemployment insurance, and an improvement in firms' hiring plans. Even so, if the rate of economic growth remains moderate, as projected, it could be several years before the unemployment rate has returned to a more normal level. Indeed, FOMC participants generally see the unemployment rate still in the range of 7-1/2 to 8 percent at the end of 2012. Until we see a sustained period of stronger job creation, we cannot consider the recovery to be truly established.Likewise, the housing sector remains exceptionally weak. The overhang of vacant and foreclosed houses is still weighing heavily on prices of new and existing homes, and sales and construction of new single-family homes remain depressed. Although mortgage rates are low and house prices have reached more affordable levels, many potential homebuyers are still finding mortgages difficult to obtain and remain concerned about possible further declines in home values.Inflation has declined, on balance, since the onset of the financial crisis, reflecting high levels of resource slack and stable longer-term inflation expectations. Indeed, over the 12 months ending in January, prices for all of the goods and services consumed by households (as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)) increased by only 1.2 percent, down from 2.5 percent in the year-earlier period. Wage growth has slowed as well, with average hourly earnings increasing only 1.9 percent over the year ending in January. In combination with productivity increases, slow wage growth has implied very tight restraint on labor costs per unit of output."
other,"Taking into account the initial conditions, signals from forward-looking surveys and estimates from structural and other models5, CPI inflation is projected to pick up from 3.7 per cent in August 2018 to 3.9 per cent in Q3:2018-19 and 4.5 per cent in Q4:2018-19, with risks somewhat tilted to the upside (Chart I.6). The projected increase in inflation from current levels reflects the waning away of favourable base effects and anticipates the feeding through of the impact of the increase in MSPs into retail inflation. The direct impact of the increase in HRA by central government has started waning and will fade away completely by December 2018. Excluding the estimated impact of HRA for central government employees, CPI inflation is projected at 3.8 per cent in Q3:2018-19 and 4.5 per cent in Q4:2018-19. The 50 per cent and the 70 per cent confidence intervals for headline inflation in Q4:2018-19 are 3.6-5.7 per cent and 3.1-6.4 per cent, respectively.There are upside and downside risks to the baseline inflation path. As stated earlier, the announced increase in MSPs for kharif crops has been much bigger than in the recent past, but there is considerable uncertainty about the exact impact of the scale and timing of government procurement operations. Other upside risks in the context of the baseline projection include supply disruptions in the global crude oil market, volatility in international financial markets and second round effects of the staggered HRA revisions by state governments. A major downside risk to the baseline could be decline in demand for oil due to global growth slowdown on account of rising trade tensions, which may help bring down oil prices."
other,"Growth in Australia's major trading partners remains a bit below average and is expected to decline a little over the forecast period, reflecting a further moderate easing in growth in China. While longer-term risks associated with high and rising debt in China remain, the downside risks to Chinese growth in the near term appear to have diminished, in large part due to strong growth of government-funded infrastructure projects and buoyant conditions in the property market. These developments have led to an increase in the demand for bulk commodities at the same time as the Chinese authorities have restricted domestic production of commodities to reduce overcapacity. This has contributed to a pick-up in bulk commodity prices and has been associated with a broad-based increase in producer prices in China.The rise in commodity prices this year has resulted in an increase in Australia's terms of trade. This represents a marked change from the pattern of recent years, whereby the terms of trade had fallen significantly and by more than expected. Although the recent increase in the terms of trade has been associated with an appreciation of the Australian dollar, it is expected to provide some support to income growth, in contrast to the period since the peak in the terms of trade in 2011. The forecasts assume that the terms of trade will remain above the low point reached earlier this year. In part, this reflects the expectation that Chinese demand for steel will remain resilient in the near term and that Chinese production of bulk commodities will not increase substantially. However, the Chinese authorities may relax efforts to reduce overcapacity in their mining industry, in response to recent sharp increases in bulk commodity prices, and there is uncertainty about the extent to which the recovery in the Chinese property market will be sustained. Either of these factors, among other things, could affect the outlook for Australia's terms of trade."
wildfires,"An out-of-control wildfire burning northeast of the Australian west coast city of Perth has destroyed at least 59 homes and was threatening more Tuesday, with many residents across the region told it is too late to leave.
The 7,000-hectare (17,000-acre) blaze, which has a 80-kilometer (50-mile) perimeter, began on Monday and raged through the night near the town of Wooroloo, with the shires of Mundaring, Chittering, Northam, and the city of Swan affected.
“Firefighters have done a remarkable job in some of the most challenging conditions that we’ve experienced in the metropolitan region for some time,” Western Australia state Department of Fire and Emergency Services Commissioner Darren Klemm said.
“Tragically, 59 properties have been lost in this fire and that number may increase as we continue to assess the extent of the damage,” Klemm added.
Six firefighters sustained minor injuries, Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported. No other injuries were reported.
The fire doubled in size overnight and burned through 7,366 hectares (18,202 acres) of farm and woodland, officials said.
State Premier Mark McGowan said 80% of all properties at Tilden Park near Gidgegannup on Perth’s northeast rural fringe have been lost.
McGowan said a large aerial tanker was flying from the Australian east coast to help fight the blaze.
“This is an extremely dangerous fire and a serious situation. Weather conditions are extremely volatile,” McGowan said.
“Please do everything you can to keep you and your family safe and look after each other,” he added.
People in a 25-kilometer (16-mile) stretch west from Wooroloo to the Walyunga National Park northeast of Perth were told Tuesday it had become too dangerous to leave their homes."
other,"With the economy expanding at a solid pace, resource utilization rising, cost pressures increasing, and short-term interest rates still relatively low, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) over the course of 2005 continued the process of removing monetary policy accommodation, raising the federal funds rate 2 percentage points in eight increments of 25 basis points each. At its meeting on January 31 of this year, the FOMC raised the federal funds rate another 1/4 percentage point, bringing its level to 4-1/2 percent.At that meeting_ monetary policymakers also discussed the economic outlook for the next two years. The central tendency of the forecasts of members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of Federal Reserve Banks is for real GDP to increase about 3-1/2 percent in 2006 and 3 percent to 3-1/2 percent in 2007. The civilian unemployment rate is expected to finish both 2006 and 2007 at a level between 4-3/4 percent and 5 percent. Inflation, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, is predicted to be about 2 percent this year and 1-3/4 percent to 2 percent next year. While considerable uncertainty surrounds any economic forecast extending nearly two years, I am comfortable with these projections.In the announcement following the January 31 meeting, the Federal Reserve pointed to risks that could add to inflation pressures. Among those risks is the possibility that, to an extent greater than we now anticipate, higher energy prices may pass through into the prices of non-energy goods and services or have a persistent effect on inflation expectations. Another factor bearing on the inflation outlook is that the economy now appears to be operating at a relatively high level of resource utilization. Gauging the economy's sustainable potential is difficult, and the Federal Reserve will keep a close eye on all the relevant evidence and be flexible in making those judgments. Nevertheless, the risk exists that, with aggregate demand exhibiting considerable momentum, output could overshoot its sustainable path, leading ultimately--in the absence of countervailing monetary policy action--to further upward pressure on inflation. In these circumstances, the FOMC judged that some further firming of monetary policy may be necessary, an assessment with which I concur."
other,"Liquidity conditions, which had tightened since mid-December, were stretched further by the larger-than-usual accumulation of cash balances by the Government, unusually heightened and persistent demand for currency, a pick-up in bank credit and flatter deposit mobilisation at this time relative to past years. The Reserve Bank undertook liquidity operations to quell these pressures and supplemented normal operations with large amounts of liquidity injected through fine-tuning variable rate repo auctions in tenors ranging between overnight and 56 days. The average daily liquidity injection (including variable rate overnight and term repos) increased from _ 1,345 billion in January to _ 1,935 billion in March. Besides, durable liquidity was also provided through open market operations (OMOs) of the order of _ 514 billion and _ 375 billion through buy-back operations in February and March. The Reserve Bank also started conducting reverse repo and MSF operations on holidays in Mumbai to enable the frictionless functioning of the payment and settlement system.Effective April 2, 2016 the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) of scheduled commercial banks was reduced by 25 basis points from 21.5 per cent to 21.25 per cent of their NDTL. Also, from February 2016, banks were allowed to reckon additional government securities held by them up to 3 per cent of their NDTL within the mandatory SLR requirement as level 1 high quality liquid assets (HQLA)  for the purpose of computing their liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), thereby taking the total carve-out from SLR available to banks equivalent to 10 per cent of their NDTL. These measures will create space for banks to increase their lending to productive sectors on competitive terms so as to support investment and growth.FCNR(B) deposits and associated swaps undertaken in September 2013 are expected to mature starting September this year. It is important to note that these swaps are fully covered by the Reserve Bank¡¯s forward purchases. Moreover, the Reserve Bank will monitor developments closely to contain any unanticipated market volatility associated with the repayment.While exports declined in February in US dollar terms for the fifteenth successive month, the rate of contraction narrowed to a single digit for the first time in this period and volume growth turned positive. The decline in non-POL exports was even smaller, with gems and jewellery, drugs and pharmaceuticals, electronics and chemicals driving the upturn. The prolonged contraction in imports also slowed significantly, and non-POL non-gold import growth turned positive for the first time after seven months. This reflected a sizable upsurge in imports of machinery, supported by a pick-up in imports of pearls and precious stones and electronic goods. With gold imports falling in February and March, the continuing softness in crude prices working favourably in terms of conserving the POL import bill and some gains in terms of trade, the trade deficit narrowed to its lowest monthly level since September 2013. In turn, this has likely lowered the current account deficit (CAD) in Q4 below 1.3 per cent of GDP recorded in Q3, despite a moderation in net receipts from services exports and remittances. Net inflows in the form of foreign direct investment (FDI) were robust in Q4 (up to January), more than sufficient to fund the external financing requirement. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs), who were net sellers in the domestic capital market up to February, became net buyers in March in both equity and debt segments."

other,"Overall liquidity in the system remained in surplus in December 2019 and January 2020. Average daily net absorption under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) amounted to _ 2.61 lakh crore in December 2019. In January 2020, the average daily net absorption of surplus liquidity soared to _ 3.18 lakh crore. The Reserve Bank conducted four auctions involving the simultaneous purchase of long-term and sale of short-term government securities under open market operations (OMOs) for a notified amount of _ 10,000 crore each during December and January (December 23 and 30, 2019 and January 6 and 23, 2020). Reflecting these operations, the 10-year G-sec yield softened cumulatively by 15 bps between December 19, 2019 and January 31, 2020. During the intervening period, however, the yields fell by as much as 25 bps. The weighted average call rate (WACR) traded below the policy repo rate (on an average) by 10 bps in December and by 19 bps in January on easy liquidity conditions. Monetary transmission across various money market segments and the private corporate bond market has been sizable. As against the cumulative reduction in the policy repo rate by 135 bps since February 2019, transmission to various money and corporate debt market segments up to January 31, 2020 ranged from 146 bps (overnight call money market) to 190 bps (3-month CPs of non-banking finance companies). Transmission through the longer end of government securities market was at 73 bps (5-year government securities) and 76 bps (10-year government securities). Transmission to the credit market is gradually improving. The 1-year median marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) declined by 55 bps during February 2019 and January 2020. The weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans sanctioned by banks declined by 69 bps and the WALR on outstanding rupee loans by 13 bps during February-December 2019.After the introduction of the external benchmark system, most banks have linked their lending rates for housing, personal and micro and small enterprises (MSEs) to the policy repo rate of the Reserve Bank. During October-December 2019, the WALRs of domestic (public and private sector) banks on fresh rupee loans declined by 18 bps for housing loans, 87 bps for vehicle loans and 23 bps for loans to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).Export growth continued to contract in November-December 2019, reflecting the slowdown in global trade. Import growth slumped in November-December 2019, with contraction in both oil and non-oil non-gold imports. While the latter reflected the underlying weakness in domestic demand and was spread across categories such as transport equipment, coal, iron and steel and chemicals, outgoes on account of oil imports were lower due to a cut back in oil import volume. Gold imports also declined in December 2019. On the financing side, net foreign direct investment rose to US$ 24.4 billion in April-November 2019 from US$ 21.2 billion a year ago. Net foreign portfolio investment was of the order of US$ 8.6 billion in 2019-20 (up to February 4) as against net outflows of US$ 14.2 billion in the same period last year. In addition, net investments by FPIs under the voluntary retention route have aggregated US$ 7.8 billion since March 11, 2019. External commercial borrowings were higher at US$ 13.4 billion during April-December 2019 as compared with US$ 2.5 billion during the same period a year ago. India¡¯s foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 471.4 billion on February 4, 2020 _ an increase of US$ 58.5 billion over end-March 2019."
earthquake,"BANGOR, Maine — Residents from all over Maine and New England felt the effects of an earthquake measuring 4.0 on the Richter scale with an epicenter in Hollis Center, Maine, on Tuesday evening.
“I literally thought my furnace was exploding,” said Portland resident and Brewer native Holly Barber, a guidance counselor at Lake Region High School in Naples. “I live in Deering Center on Pleasant Avenue, and I was right here in my room.”
The quake was centered 3 miles west of Hollis Center and 13 miles northwest of Biddeford, according to the United States Geological Survey, and was just over 4 miles deep. The service notes the quake occurred at 7:12 p.m. Tuesday.
eports of the quake spread like wildfire through social media. A Facebook group created shortly after it struck, called “I survived the 10/16/12 earthquake,” was liked by more than 38,000 people by approximately 8:20 p.m. On Twitter, users reported feeling the tremors from around the state.
While there were no immediate reports of physical damage, some users reported problems with cellphone providers AT&T and Verizon Wireless and phone provider Time Warner after the quake.
The Maine Emergency Management Agency had no immediate reports of damage or injuries."
other,"After languishing for five consecutive quarters, economic activity in India is quickening, as estimates and high frequency as well as survey-based indicators etch out for the second half of 2017-18. Growth is strengthening and several elements are coming together to nurture this nascent acceleration: expectations of a record foodgrains output; strong sales growth by corporations; depleting finished goods inventories; and, restart of investment in fixed assets by corporations pointing to renewal of the capex cycle. Several services sectors, including the information technology sector in terms of its international competitiveness, have shown resilience. These are some of the developments that support brighter prospects for the Indian economy in 2018-19. A significant development has been that this time around, the step-up in growth is propelled by a revival of investment on the demand side and manufacturing on the supply side. This outlook will be lifted by tailwinds from remonetisation and implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST).The path of inflation will likely be influenced by effects of the increase in house rent allowances (HRAs) for central government employees, which is purely statistical and has to be looked through to gauge true inflation developments. As this effect wanes, inflation could moderate in the remaining part of 2018-19 from an upturn in Q1 under the baseline assumptions."
other,"As per the existing roadmap, scheduled commercial banks have to reach the minimum Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of 100 per cent by January 1, 2019. Presently, the assets allowed as Level 1 High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLAs) for the purpose of computing LCR of banks include, inter alia, Government securities in excess of the minimum SLR requirement and, within the mandatory SLR requirement, Government securities to the extent allowed by the Reserve Bank under Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) [presently 2 per cent of the bank's NDTL] and under Facility to Avail Liquidity for Liquidity Coverage Ratio (FALLCR) [presently 9 per cent of the bank's NDTL]. For the purpose of computing LCR, it has been decided that, in addition to the above-mentioned assets, banks will be permitted to reckon as Level 1 HQLAs Government securities held by them upto another 2 per cent of their NDTL under FALLCR within the mandatory SLR requirement. Hence, the total carve-out from SLR available to banks would be 13 per cent of their NDTL. The other prescriptions in respect of LCR remain unchanged. As per extant guidelines on prudential norms for classification, valuation and operation of investment portfolio by banks, the state government securities are valued applying the Yield to Maturity (YTM) method with a uniform mark-up of 25 basis points above the yield of the Central Government securities (G-Secs) of equivalent maturity.It has now been decided that the securities issued by each state government should be valued based on observed prices. The valuation of traded state government securities shall be at the price at which they have been traded in the market. In case of non-traded state government securities, the valuation shall be based on the state-specific weighted average spread over the yield of the central government securities of equivalent maturity, as observed at primary auctions. The detailed guidelines to this effect will be issued separately by June 20, 2018.In the wake of spurt in the yields of government securities, banks were given an option to spread, over four quarters, the mark-to-market losses recorded on their investment portfolio during the quarters ended December 2017 and March 2018. It was also required that banks build an Investment Fluctuation Reserve (IFR) of 2 percent of their holdings in the AFS and HFT categories to avoid such eventualities. In view of the continuing rise in yield of government securities as also the inadequacy of time to build IFR for many banks, it has been decided to grant banks the option to spread the mark-to-market (MTM) losses on investments held in Available for Sale (AFS) and Held for Trading (HFT) portfolio for the quarter ending June 30, 2018, equally over a period of four quarters, commencing from the quarter ending June 30, 2018. The circular in this regard will be issued within a week."
other,"Globally, monetary policy remains very accommodative and is supporting economic activity, although inflation remains below most central banks' targets. The US Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate target in December for the first time in nearly 10 years, although the stance of policy in the United States remains very accommodative and the pace of future rate increases is expected to be very gradual. In December, the European Central Bank (ECB) announced a package of measures designed to ease monetary policy further. More recently, the Bank of Japan also eased policy further by reducing the rate it pays on marginal reserves to _10 basis points while announcing that it would continue to expand its balance sheet over 2016 as planned.The diverging monetary policy trends among the major central banks, concerns about the challenges facing the Chinese authorities and large declines in oil prices have contributed to an increase in volatility in global financial markets of late. Sovereign bond yields have declined noticeably since late last year, as have equity prices. Also, spreads on corporate bonds in the United States, euro area and Australia increased owing to sharp rises in spreads for energy and resource-related companies. Large flows associated with capital outflows from China, together with asset sales by sovereign wealth funds of oil-producing nations, also appear to have contributed to market volatility. Despite this volatility, high-quality borrowers still have access to finance at very favourable rates."
other,"The evolving CPI inflation trajectory is likely to be subjected to both upside and downside pressures. The bumper foodgrains production in 2020-21 should sustain softening of cereal prices going forward. While the prices of pulses, particularly tur and urad, remain elevated, the incoming rabi harvest arrivals in the markets and the overall increase in domestic production in 2020-21 should augment supply which, along with imports, should enable some softening of these prices going forward. While edible oils inflation has been ruling at heightened levels with international prices remaining firm, reduction of import duties and appropriate incentives to enhance productivity domestically could work towards a better demand-supply balance over the medium-term. Pump prices of petroleum products have remained high. Reduction of excise duties and cesses and state level taxes could provide some relief to consumers on top of the recent easing of international crude prices. This could slow down the propagation of second-round effects. The impact of high international commodity prices and increased logistics costs are being felt across manufacturing and services. Finally, inflation expectations of urban households one year ahead showed a marginal increase than over the three months ahead horizon according to the Reserve Bank¡¯s March 2021 survey. Taking into consideration all these factors, CPI inflation is now projected as 5.0 per cent in Q4:2020-21; 5.2 per cent in Q1:2021-22, 5.2 per cent in Q2, 4.4 per cent in Q3 and 5.1 per cent in Q4, with risks broadly balanced (Chart 1).Turning to the growth outlook, rural demand remains buoyant and record agriculture production for 2020-21 bodes well for its resilience. Urban demand has been gaining strength on the back of normalisation of economic activity and should get a fillip with the ongoing vaccination drive. The fiscal stimulus from increased allocation for capital expenditure under the Union Budget 2021-22, expanded production-linked incentives (PLI) scheme and rising capacity utilisation (from 63.3 per cent in Q2 to 66.6 per cent in Q3:2020-21) should provide strong support to investment demand and exports. Firms engaged in manufacturing, services and infrastructure polled by the Reserve Bank in March 2021 were optimistic about a pick-up in demand and expansion in business activity into 2021-22. Consumer confidence, on the other hand, has dipped with the recent surge in COVID infections in some states imparting uncertainty to the outlook. Taking these factors into consideration, the projection of real GDP growth for 2021-22 is retained at 10.5 per cent consisting of 26.2 per cent in Q1, 8.3 per cent in Q2, 5.4 per cent in Q3 and 6.2 per cent in Q4 (Chart 2).The MPC notes that the supply side pressures on inflation could persist. It also notes that demand-side pull remains moderate. While cost-push pressures have risen, they could be partially offset with the normalisation of global supply chains. On imported inflation from global commodity prices, urgent concerted and coordinated policy actions by Centre and States can mitigate domestic input costs such as taxes on petrol and diesel and high retail margins. The renewed jump in COVID-19 infections in certain parts of the country and the associated localised lockdowns could dampen the demand for contact-intensive services, restrain growth impulses and prolong the return to normalcy. In such an environment, continued policy support remains necessary. Taking these developments into consideration, the MPC decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward.All members of the MPC _ Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das _ unanimously voted for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged. Furthermore, all members of the MPC voted to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward."
wildfires,"Hundreds of people were forced to flee their homes after a wildfire broke out in the Texas panhandle.
The fire started around 4 p.m. Sunday (5 p.m. ET) near Fritch in Hutchinson County. It destroyed more than 100 homes and continued to rage into the night despite being 75 per cent contained by firefighters.
""We have more than 100 homes confirmed destroyed but we won't know how many have actually been burned until it gets light,"" Fritch Police Chief Monty Leggett told NBC News at 4:30 a.m. local time on Monday (5:30 a.m. ET)
Leggett said that between 300 and 400 people had been forced to leave their houses in the surrounding area of Fritch and an unknown number were without power. Officials had considered evacuating the 2,100-population city itself but decided late Sunday it was not necessary.
There were no deaths or injuries related to the blaze, the police chief added.
Every fire department in Hutchinson County was called to the blaze and people were evacuated to at least three schools and churches being used for shelter across the area.
""Words cannot express the sadness and fear you have for the people’s homes, belongings and lives,"" Vicki Bybee, one of the evacuees, told the Amarillo Globe News.
The blaze had consumed more than 1,500 acres and around 100 emergency service personnel were on the ground battling to contain it as of 4:30 a.m. local time. The Texas Forestry Service was scheduled to assist the effort with water drops from two aircraft on Monday, Leggett added."
Typhoon,"There has been a lull in tropical activity around the globe for the beginning of September, with most of the activity occurring in the Atlantic. Fortunately, none of these storms have developed to become monster storms that threatened large areas of land. For now, the main focus is across the western North Pacific Ocean where a super typhoon has its eyes set for parts of South Korea and the Japanese island of Okinawa. The good news about Super Typhoon Sanba is that it will likely gradually weaken as it pushes to the north. However, the storm will likely pack a punch across South Korea.
Sanba, which was the 17th tropical depression to form in the western North Pacific Ocean developed on September 11, 2012. Within two days, Sanba hit ideal conditions to strengthen into a Category 5 hurricane, which we call a “Super Typhoon” in the western Pacific. “Super-typhoon” is a term utilized by the U.S. Joint Typhoon Warning Center for typhoons that reach maximum sustained 1-minute surface winds around 130 knots or 150 miles per hour. If you compare this to the Saffir-Simpson scale, it would be a very strong category 4 or 5 hurricane in the Atlantic basin. Yesterday, Sanba moved over very warm waters and was able to develop maximum sustained winds of 175 mph with gusts approximately around 200 mph. Just as a reference to give you an idea how strong Sanba truly is, an EF-4 tornado has sustained winds around 168-199 mph. Fortunately, systems that gain such a large increase in strength tend to weaken and undergoes an eye wall replacement cycle. Once a new eye forms, it could intensify again (assuming conditions remain favorable)."

West appeared at Chicago's Soldier Field for his third listening party, where he had a replica built of his childhood home. But that was just the beginning.
Throughout the event, Kanye wore all black and had his face covered by a mask. He brought out special guests Marilyn Manson and DaBaby, who have both been under scrutiny in the news recently. Manson is facing sexual assault and abuse accusations from women, which he has denied, and DaBaby was caught up in a controversy around homophobic comments he has since apologized for.
For the final song, Kanye appeared to be set on fire.
He was then met by a bride with a veil over her face who turned out to be Kardashian West, who filed for divorce from West in February. Kylie Jenner shared the moment in her Instagram stories. West and Kardashian left the venue holding hands as the finale.
The latest listening party comes after West threw two at Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium on July 22 and Aug. 5. The rapper was also living at the stadium, trying to put the final touches on the album, dedicated to his late mother Donda West.
The album originally had a July 23 release date."
Typhoon,"A fast-moving typhoon blew away from the Philippines on Monday after leaving at least 13 people missing, forcing thousands of villagers to flee to safety and flooding rural villages, disaster-response officials said.
The 13 people missing from Typhoon Molave included a dozen fishermen who ventured out to sea over the weekend despite a no-sail restriction due to very rough seas. There were no immediate reports of casualties.
The typhoon was blowing west toward the South China Sea with sustained winds of 125 kilometers (77 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 150 kph (93 mph). It roared overnight through island provinces south of the capital, Manila, which was lashed by strong winds but escaped major damage.
At least 25,000 villagers were displaced, with about 20,000 taking shelter in schools and government buildings that were turned into evacuation centers, the Office of Civil Defense said, but officials added that some have returned home in regions where the weather has cleared."

other,"Vegetables account for 6 per cent of the CPI and 13.2 per cent of the food and beverages group. A delayed winter easing of price pressures in vegetables commenced from December 2017 and extended well up to April 2018, as mandi arrivals, specifically of onions and tomatoes, surged muting the usual summer upturn (Chart II.9a). Onion inflation declined from a high of 159 per cent in December 2017 to 23 per cent in May 2018, pulled down by bumper mandi arrivals, imports, and implementation of a minimum export price (MEP) that deterred exports, together creating persistent surplus supply conditions. Onion prices, however, picked up in July with the country-wide transporters¡¯ strike, which affected the supplies of essential food items. After remaining low during April-May, prices of tomatoes recorded an upsurge during June-July due to widespread farmers¡¯ agitations. By contrast, price pressures have been more pronounced in respect of potatoes since March 2018 due to lower availability of stocks from cold storages, transport disruptions and protests organised by potato farmers against not receiving remunerative prices for their crops. Prices of vegetables, however, witnessed some easing in August 2018 led by a contraction in prices of tomatoes and moderation in onion price pressures as arrivals surged, which played a key role in moderating food inflation during the month.An analysis of prices of vegetables based on sectoral CPI indices suggests that there is no statistically significant difference in month-on-month changes in prices of vegetables between rural and urban areas.5 A decomposition of the CPI-vegetables into its trend and cyclical components reveals a rising trend since H1:2017-18, indicating that the recent softening in vegetable prices may not be structural in nature (Chart II.9b).
Fruits prices also declined during June-August, contrary to the usual seasonal pattern. Fruits have a weight of 2.9 per cent in the CPI and 6.3 per cent within the food and beverages sub-component. Healthy domestic production of major fruits like mangoes and bananas, together with imports of some fruits (particularly apples and citrus fruits) pulled down fruits prices in contrast to the usual pattern in June and July every year when they rise (Chart II.10)."
earthquake,"In a land of people used to earthquakes, everyone is saying this one, which hit at 14:46 local time, is the strongest they’ve ever felt-and that’s in Tokyo, some 400 kilometers southwest from the epicenter.
Scientists are calling it the biggest earthquake in Japan’s tremor-filled history. Preliminary estimates from the USGS put the magnitude at 7.9, which have since grown to 8.9. Estimates of the depth range from 10-20 kilometres. This earthquake was 178 times as powerful as the 1995 Hanshin/Kobe earthquake.
Miyagi prefecture was pummeled the hardest. There Japan’s earthquake intensity scale, which measures the amount of shaking at ground level, recorded a 7, the highest level. More than 20 deaths have been reported.
Tsunamis reaching 10 metres have hit the area and 3 metres tsunami are reported down all the way down the coast far past Tokyo.
Panic gripped Tokyo as bookshelves and installations in offices fell, people poured into the streets and more than a dozen buildings reported fire sending smoke billowing into the sky.

Tong Ying-kit, whose flag bore the phrase ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times"", was earlier found guilty of inciting secession and terrorism.
He was the first person to be charged under Hong Kong's controversial national security law.
Friday's verdict has set the tone for how future cases might be interpreted.
More than 100 people have been arrested since the law came into force in 2020.
Critics say it reduces Hong Kong's autonomy and makes it easier to punish activists. But Beijing insists that the law is needed to bring stability to the city.
""We consider that this overall term should sufficiently reflect the defendant's culpability in the two offences and the abhorrence of society, at the same time, achieving the deterrent effect required,"" the judges who presided over the case said in a written judgement, according to Reuters.
Tong's conviction for secession was because of the slogan on his flag, with police adding that he was guilty of terrorist activities as his actions were a ""deliberate challenge against the police""."

The officials said over 270,000 people were affected by the rains that lashed out for days and caused heavy flooding across the island nation.  But the water levels had started receding now even as the authorities issued fresh landslide warnings for ten districts, they said.  “The deaths included those who went swimming in the flood water. We are closely monitoring the situation,” senior disaster management officer Pradeep Kodippili told EFE.  He said rescuers evacuated over 26,000 people to safer places as floodwaters marooned thousands of families.  The heavy rains have disrupted the electricity supply at many places across the island.  The meteorology department said more rains might hit the southwest of the island in the next two days.

earthquake,"TOKYO - A ferocious tsunami spawned by one of the largest earthquakes ever recorded slammed Japan's eastern coast Friday, killing hundreds as it swept away boats, cars and homes while widespread fires burned out of control. Tsunami warnings blanketed the entire Pacific, as far away as South America, Canada, Alaska and the entire U.S. West Coast.
The magnitude 8.9 offshore quake unleashed a 23-foot tsunami and was followed by more than 50 aftershocks for hours, many of them of more than magnitude 6.0.
Japanese police say 200 to 300 bodies were found in Sendai, the closest major city to the epicenter. Earlier, police confirmed at least 60 people had been killed and 56 were missing. The death toll was likely to continue climbing given the scale of Friday's disaster; extensive search and rescue efforts were still just getting underway.
A Japanese coast guard official said a search is under way for a ship carrying 80 dock workers that was swept away by the tsunami. The vessel was washed away from a shipbuilding site in Miyagi prefecture, close to the earthquake's epicenter.
Dozens of cities and villages along a 1,300-mile stretch of coastline were shaken by violent tremors that reached as far away as Tokyo, hundreds of miles from the epicenter."
other,"Pressure from rising commodity prices was also reflected in an increase in input costs of manufacturing firms covered in the Reserve Bank¡¯s industrial outlook survey. These firms reported a rise in the cost of raw materials in Q2:2018-19 and expected it to increase further in Q3. However, they are not expecting to pass the entire cost burden to selling prices, reflecting still subdued pricing power. The manufacturing purchasing managers¡¯ index (PMI) as well as the services PMI point to an increase in the cost of raw materials in Q1 and Q2 so far. Firms covered in these indices also reported an increase in their selling prices, indicating that some pass-through of higher costs to clients may already be occurring.Going forward, inflation outcomes will be influenced by several factors. The government has announced measures aimed at ensuring remunerative prices to the farmers for their produce. The magnitude of the impact of these measures on CPI inflation will be contingent upon the manner and effectiveness with which these measures are implemented. Risks to inflation could emanate from rising geopolitical and trade tensions, with attendant implications for global commodity prices and financial markets. The impact of the 7th CPC HRA award on headline inflation has started waning and the effect of increases in HRA by states is not yet visible. As and when HRA awards by states start showing up in the CPI, it will impact headline inflation. As in the case of the centre¡¯s HRA, second round effects will warrant vigilance. The near-term inflation expectations of households and those of businesses polled in the forward-looking surveys of the Reserve Bank of India have firmed up over successive rounds, with the potential to feed into wages and input costs. While low food inflation prints and the positive outlook on food _ on account of supply management measures by government and a normal monsoon _ provide comfort, it is necessary to be watchful as several upside risks to inflation persist, notably from surging oil prices and volatile financial markets."
Typhoon,"Tropical Storm Arthur hits North Carolina coast with rain Tropical Storm Arthur moved out to sea Monday after dumping heavy rain on North Carolina as forecasters warned that the first named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season could continue to whip dangerous surf and rip currents for another day or more along the U.S. East Coast. The storm represented another early start for the Atlantic hurricane season. Arthur formed Saturday in waters off Florida, marking the sixth straight year that a named storm has developed before June 1. By late Monday, storm watches and warnings that had been in effect for parts of the North Carolina coast were canceled. As Arthur’s center passed off North Carolina earlier in the day, a pocket along the coast that includes Newport and Havelock recorded more than 4 inches (10 cm) of rain, according to the National Weather Service. Other areas along the coast saw 2 inches (5 cm) or more, causing some secondary roads to flood. Wind gusts of 40 mph or more (64 kph) were recorded in at least two places on the Outer Banks, the weather service said. The Hurricane Center said Arthur was moving northeast at 16 mph (26 kph) Monday afternoon as its center pulled away from the U.S. mainland. At 5 p.m. EDT, the storm’s center was located about 110 miles (175 kilometers) northeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Arthur had top sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph). Forecasters said Arthur could strengthen some as it moves away from land, but was likely to lose its tropical storm characteristics later Monday or Tuesday. North Carolina Emergency Management Director Mike Sprayberry said that over-wash or standing water had closed a highway on the Outer Banks and another on the mainland. Other secondary roads had flooded. Otherwise, he said conditions were stable and that no other serious problems had been reported to the state. Still, he warned that surf conditions will remain dangerous and advised people to be cautious around the water even as the storm pushes out to sea. “People in the eastern part of our state should remain cautious, especially while driving in areas where water may collect on roads,” he said at a news conference. “Today is not the day to take risks at the beach or in the surf.” Forecasters said rough surf could continue for another day or two. While other pre-June storms may be influenced by warming waters and climate change, Arthur is more of a subtropical system than a traditional named storm, said Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach, who added that its water is cooler than what’s usually needed for storm formation. A lot of these out-of-season storms are weak ones that meteorologists can detect because of satellites and other technology, but comparable storms would have been missed in an earlier era, Klotzbach said."
other,"Central banks use monetary policy to manage the supply of money in a country¡¯s economy. With monetary policy, a central bank increases or decreases the amount of currency and credit in circulation, in a continuing effort to keep inflation, growth and employment on track.In the U.S., the Federal Reserve is responsible for monetary policy. Congress has tasked the Federal Reserve with a ¡°dual mandate¡± that it pursues with monetary policy: maximize employment and maintain steady prices. In general, that means the Fed aims to keep unemployment low, but not zero, to foster productivity without inciting higher inflation. There¡¯s no official target range, but historically the Fed has focused on keeping unemployment at about 3.5% to 4.5%.As for inflation, the Fed normally targets average annual price increases of about 2%, though it plans to allow rates to run slightly higher in the short term to help the economy recover from the impact of Covid-19 in 2020. When unemployment is low and inflation is around the 2% level, consumers and businesses are in a good position to spend and invest money¡ªas well as save adequate cash reserves¡ªwhich meets the Fed¡¯s mandate for a highly functioning economy.¡°The power of the Fed is derived primarily from its authority over these two prominent aspects of the economy,¡± says Robert Johnson, professor of finance at Creighton University. ¡°The Fed executes these objectives through its power to control the money supply.¡± It was given these responsibilities in 1977 through a Congressional dual mandate, and it may enact its powers using a handful of tools."
other,"In order to mitigate risks of excessive leverage, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) designed the Basel III Leverage Ratio (LR) as a simple, transparent, and non-risk-based measure to supplement existing risk-based capital adequacy requirements. In terms of the framework on LR put in place by the Reserve Bank, banks have been monitored against an indicative LR of 4.5%. These guidelines have served the purpose of disclosures and also as the basis for parallel run by banks. The final minimum LR requirement was to be stipulated taking into consideration the final rules prescribed by the Basel Committee by end 2017.BCBS has since finalized that banks must meet a minimum 3% LR requirement at all times (Basel III: Finalising post-crisis reforms, December 2017). Both the capital measure and the exposure measure are to be calculated on a quarter-end basis. However, banks may, subject to supervisory approval, use more frequent calculations (e.g., daily or monthly average) as long as they do so consistently.Keeping in mind financial stability and with a view to moving further towards harmonisation with Basel III standards, it has been decided that the minimum LR should be 4% for Domestic Systemically Important Banks (DSIBs) and 3.5% for other banks. The instructions in this regard shall be issued before end of June 2019.It was notified in the Guidelines for Licensing of ¡°Payments Banks¡± and ¡°Small Finance Banks¡± in the Private Sector dated November 27, 2014, that after gaining experience in dealing with these banks, the Reserve Bank will consider ¡®on tap¡¯ licensing of these banks.In the case of Small Finance Banks, license was issued to ten such banks. Further, eight of the ten Small Finance Banks have also been included in the second schedule of the RBI Act, 1934. A review of the performance of Small Finance Banks reveals that they have achieved their priority sector targets and thus attained their mandate for furthering financial inclusion. Hence, there is a case for more players to be included to enhance access to banking facilities to the small borrowers and to encourage competition. It is, therefore, proposed to issue the Draft Guidelines for ¡®on tap¡¯ Licensing of Small Finance Banks by the end of August 2019.It has also been decided that more time is needed to review the performance of Payments Banks before considering the licensing of this category of banks to be put ¡®on tap¡¯.In August 2010, the Reserve Bank introduced a separate framework for the regulation of systemically important Core Investment Companies (CICs) recognising the difference in the business model of a holding company relative to other non-banking financial companies. Over the years, corporate group structures have become more complex involving multiple layering and leveraging, which has led to greater inter-connectedness to the financial system through their access to public funds. Further, in light of recent developments, there is a need to strengthen the corporate governance framework of CICs. Accordingly, it has been decided to set up a Working Group to review the regulatory guidelines and supervisory framework applicable to CICs."
drought,"The word drought can be somewhat subjective and have various meanings for different people. When I think of what the word drought means, a period of prolonged dryness that reduces plant growth and/or causes damage to crops comes to my mind. A drought can be very short term, lasting several weeks or months (even as little as a few days for containerized plants) or last over an extended period of time (even multiple years). No two drought events are the same, but they all have one thing in common — the absence of water.
It’s not uncommon for various parts of the country to experience short- or long-term droughts with some regularity. With the potential for drought, its frequency at some locations as well as the possibility of water use restrictions, drought tolerance has certainly become an increasingly desirable characteristic of landscape plants. Keep in mind that some perennials are more drought tolerant than others.
Surviving Drought
The architecture of the leaves influences a plant’s ability to withstand drought. Thick, waxy leaves have the ability to store moisture. Hairy or fuzzy leaves tend to keep the moisture trapped near the leaf surface. And fine, lacey foliage allow plants to lose less water due to the reduced surface area."

Accordingly, several initiatives viz. introduction of non-competitive bidding in primary auctions, permitting stock exchanges to act as aggregators/facilitators for retail investors and allowing odd-lot segment in the NDS-OM secondary market, have been taken in the past. As part of continuing efforts to increase retail participation in government securities and to improve ease of access, it has been decided to move beyond aggregator model and provide retail investors online access to the government securities market _ both primary and secondary - along with the facility to open their gilt securities account (¡®Retail Direct¡¯) with the RBI. Details of the facility will be issued separately.At present, foreign portfolio investors (FPI) can invest in security receipts and debt instruments issued by Asset Reconstruction Companies and debt instruments issued by an entity under the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process as per the resolution plan approved by the National Company Law Tribunal under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 and these investments are exempted from the short-term limit and minimum residual maturity requirement under the Medium Term Framework (MTF) for investment by FPIs in corporate bonds. In order to further promote investment by FPIs in corporate bonds, it is proposed to extend similar exemptions to defaulted corporate bonds. Accordingly, FPI investment in defaulted corporate bonds will be exempted from the short-term limit and the minimum residual maturity requirement under the MTF. Detailed guidelines are being issued separately."

other,"Central Bank of Sri Lanka is responsible for conducting monetary policy in Sri Lanka, which mainly involves setting the policy interest rates and managing the liquidity in the economy. The monetary operations of the Central Bank influences interest rates in the economy, affecting the behavior of borrowers and lenders, economic activity and ultimately the rate of inflation. Therefore, the Central Bank uses monetary policy to control inflation and keep it within a desired path.Economic and price stability is a situation where there are no wide fluctuations in the general price level in the economy, which helps to achieve sustainable economic growth. When the prices fluctuate at a low rate, they would not have any significant influence on economic decisions of agents of the economy, viz. households and firms. Moreover, price stability helps better anchor inflation expectations among public, which in turn makes it easier to keep actual inflation at low and stable levels. Therefore, stable prices would not distort the economic decisions regarding what to produce and how to produce, thus enabling efficient allocation of resources in the economy leading to economic stability and sustainable growth in the economy over the longer term."

Typhoon,"Hong Kong may have to brace for a typhoon slamming its large container port this weekend.
A cluster of thunderstorms over the Philippines has the potential to become a typhoon during the next couple of days. This would be the second named storm of the 2020 Pacific typhoon season. The first was Typhoon Vongfong, known as Typhoon Ambo in the Philippines, which hit that island nation in May. The season runs throughout the year, but most Pacific typhoons develop from May through October.
This storm, which would be named Typhoon Nuri, will likely track over the northern Philippines on Friday, June 12, moving into southeastern China over the weekend. The projected track takes the storm close to Hong Kong on Sunday, June 14.
The potential typhoon could delay various services, from container cargo to cruises and public transportation.
Hong Kong is one of the busiest container ports in the world, according to the Hong Kong Maritime and Port Board website. It handled 18.3 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) of containers in 2019, and provided about 300 container liner services per week connecting to around 420 destinations worldwide.The Port of Hong Kong is also home to cruise liners and government fleets, and it operates ferries between Hong Kong and mainland China."
other,"At the longer end, the issuances of SDLs moderated in Q3, partly in reaction to the tightening financial conditions in the bond market. However, issuances peaked in Q4 reflecting the increased expenditure by the States towards end of the financial year. The weighted average spreads over the 10-year G-sec yield moderated to 56 bps in H2 as compared with 63 bps in H1 (Chart IV.12). There were no issuances under the UDAY scheme during 2017-18 and the total secondary market trading volume (face value) of UDAY bonds was _898 billion.Following the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission, all states (barring Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala and Arunachal Pradesh) have been excluded from the National Small Savings Fund (NSSF) financing facility beginning 2016-17. Consequently, market borrowings of states increased, also triggered by large redemptions of past borrowings. This drove up the supply of SDLs, which in turn impacted yields in the bond market, already reeling under the pressures of oversupply of paper.The relationship between the spread on SDLs and fiscal situation of individual States remained weak during 2017-18. The inter-state spread during the year at 6 bps was marginally lower than that of 7 bps in 2016-17."
earthquake,"A powerful aftershock with magnitude 5.9 caused additional damage in central Greece Thursday, a day after an earthquake damaged hundreds of homes in the same area.
Authorities said some empty houses, which had been abandoned by their inhabitants after suffering damage Wednesday, collapsed but no injuries were reported.
According to the Athens Geodynamic Institute, the aftershock struck as night fell Thursday outside the central town of Elasona, some 365 kilometers (225 miles) northwest of the Greek capital.
Local authorities advised people in the area to remain outdoors for a second night.
“We are advising people not to return to their homes in the area near the epicenter,” said Efthymios Lekkas, head of the state-run Earthquake Planning and Protection Organization.
“This latest event came from a section of the faultline that we had not considered to be active. It surprised us.”
The army set up tents in the area Wednesday after a 6.0-magnitude earthquake jolted the region and was felt as far as Montenegro, some 500 kilometers (310 miles) to the north.
It caused no serious injuries, but scores of homes were damaged in several villages near Elasona."
Typhoon,"CloudSat overpassed Typhoon Guchol in the West Pacific on June 16, 2012 @ 0500 UTC. Typhoon Guchol, just east of the Philippines, contained sustained winds of 120 knots (104 mph) and minimum pressure of 948 mb.
The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA's Aqua satellite captured the infrared (IR) image taken a few minutes before the CloudSat overpass (the blue line). CloudSat overpassed just to the east of the center of the storm through the eye wall and. Heavy precipitation is distinuguished by the attenuation of the radar (lack of signal) in the lowest 5 km's of the CloudSat swath. A large area of moderate and light precipitation extends hundreds of kilometers south of the center of the storm. Individual cumulonimbus cells are evident underneath the anvil shield (towards the B label).
Typhoon Guchol strengthened into a Super Typhoon shortly after this image was captured and continued north and westward towards Japan. Guchol brought heavy rains and high winds to parts of Japan on June 19 and 20, 2012 as a tropical storm."
wildfires,"Hawaii's governor on Friday declared an emergency on the island of Maui, where firefighters were battling a blaze that has forced the evacuations of thousands of people and sent huge clouds of smoke billowing over nearby beaches.
The fire on Maui, sometimes called the Valley Isle, has scorched more than 10,000 acres (4,000 hectares) of former sugar cane fields and brush since erupting on Thursday, and by Friday was 20 percent contained, island officials said in a statement.
The blaze began in the island's central valley, and steady winds of up to 20 miles per hour (30 kmh) stoked the flames, officials said. The fire prompted thousands of residents and visitors in the communities of Maalaea and Kihei to flee as a precaution.
""I am declaring our Valley Isle a disaster area for the purpose of implementing the emergency management functions as allowed by law,"" Hawaii Governor David Ige said in a statement.
The Honolulu Star-Advertiser said there were no reports of injuries or damage to buildings. The cause of the fire was under investigation.
Oprah Winfrey, who owns a property on Maui, opened a private road on Thursday to assist Maui County officials in dealing with the fire. Ige thanked the television personality on Twitter.
Firefighters have used helicopters to drop water in an attempt to quell the blaze."
drought,"The drought and the massive displacement of people in the Horn of Africa, in addition to conflict and violence, high food prices, and dwindling resources, has resulted in one of the most dramatic global humanitarian crises.
According to the latest reports by the World Food Programme, some 10 million people are affected by the Horn of Africa's worst drought in 60 years.
Two consecutive rainy seasons have failed, producing a decline of more than 25% of rain for pastoral areas in Somalia, Northern and Eastern Kenya, Southern and Eastern Ethiopia and Djibouti. As a result harvests have failed, livestock mortality has soared, and food and water have become extremely expensive.
The price of food for essential cereals like maize has increased 2,5 times in Eastern Kenya, Eastern Ethiopia and Southern Somalia. Millions of people in the region cannot meet basic survival needs, and emergency levels of acute malnutrition are widespread.
In most areas affected by the drought, malnutrition is affecting over 30% of people, which is more than double the internationally recognized emergency threshold. Those who can are leaving their land and their homes to walk long distances trying to find food and water. Many Somalis are crossing borders to do that. An estimated 3,000 people a day are arriving in Kenya and Ethiopia from Somalia in search for a help.
The crisis is expected to worsen over the coming three to four months. ""If we don't act now, famine will spread to all eight regions of southern Somalia within two months, due to poor harvests and infectious disease outbreaks,"" told Mark Bowden, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Somalia. 
Recovery is not expected until next year, given the expected late and below-average harvests, the depletion of pasture and water and the high prices of food, water, and fuel. This is why the rapid scaling-up of the emergency response is vital to address the humanitarian needs and to prevent further deterioration."
other,"Turning to the outlook for inflation, kharif sowing portends well for food prices. Pressures on prices of key vegetables like tomatoes, onions and potatoes should also ebb by Q3 with kharif arrivals. On the other hand, prices of pulses and oilseeds are likely to remain firm due to elevated import duties. International crude oil prices have traded with a softening bias in September on a weak demand outlook, but domestic pump prices may remain elevated in the absence of any roll back of taxes. Pricing power of firms remains weak in the face of subdued demand. COVID-19-related supply disruptions, including labour shortages and high transportation costs, could continue to impose cost-push pressures, but these risks are getting mitigated by progressive easing of lockdowns and removal of restrictions on inter-state movements. Taking into consideration all these factors, CPI inflation is projected at 6.8 per cent for Q2:2020-21, at 5.4-4.5 per cent for H2:2020-21 and 4.3 per cent for Q1:2021-22, with risks broadly balanced (Chart 1).Turning to the growth outlook, the recovery in the rural economy is expected to strengthen further, while the turnaround in urban demand is likely to be lagged in view of social distancing norms and the elevated number of COVID-19 infections. While the contact-intensive services sector will take time to regain pre-COVID levels, manufacturing firms expect capacity utilisation to recover in Q3:2020-21 and activity to gain some traction from Q4 onwards. Both private investment and exports are likely to be subdued, especially as external demand is still anaemic. Taking into consideration the above factors and the uncertain COVID-19 trajectory, real GDP growth in 2020-21 is expected to be negative at (-)9.5 per cent, with risks tilted to the downside: (-)9.8 per cent in Q2:2020-21; (-)5.6 per cent in Q3; and 0.5 per cent in Q4. Real GDP growth for Q1:2021-22 is placed at 20.6 per cent (Chart 2).The MPC is of the view that revival of the economy from an unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic assumes the highest priority in the conduct of monetary policy. While inflation has been above the tolerance band for several months, the MPC judges that the underlying factors are essentially supply shocks which should dissipate over the ensuing months as the economy unlocks, supply chains are restored, and activity normalises. Accordingly, they can be looked through at this juncture while setting the stance of monetary policy. Taking into account all these factors, the MPC decides to maintain status quo on the policy rate in this meeting and await the easing of inflationary pressures to use the space available for supporting growth further.All members of the MPC _ Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das _ unanimously voted for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged and continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted to continue with this accommodative stance at least during the current financial year and into the next financial year, with Prof. Jayanth R. Varma voting against this formulation."

This policy stance, which has been in place since April 2012, was assessed to be appropriate for containing domestic and imported sources of inflation amid the ongoing economic restructuring.Over the last six months, the S$NEER fluctuated within the upper half of the policy band.  It trended upwards from April until July, strengthening alongside the generally positive investor sentiment in Asia.  The S$NEER then experienced some downward pressures from August to mid-September, largely reflecting a rise in geopolitical risks and market reactions to the possibility of an earlier-than-expected rate hike by the US Federal Reserve.  However, it subsequently resumed a mild appreciation trajectory.  Given the accommodative global interest rate environment, the three-month S$ SIBOR remained low and steady, averaging 0.41% from April to September 2014."
drought,"Many parts of the Greater Horn of Africa are expected to receive below average rainfall in the important March to May rainy season, worsening food security and water availability in countries already seriously hit by drought, according to a new seasonal outlook issued by the Greater Horn of Africa Climate Outlook Forum.
“What makes the current drought alarming in the Equatorial Greater Horn of Africa region is that it follows two consecutive poor rainfall seasons in 2016, and the likelihood of depressed rainfall persisting into the March-May 2017 rainfall season remains high,” said the Intergovernmental Authority on Development’s Climate Prediction and Applications Center (ICPAC), which convened the regional forum.
“The situation will be worse in countries already experiencing drought, including Somalia, Kenya, Ethiopia, parts of Uganda, South Sudan and parts of Tanzania. Many parts of the region will experience serious water stress,” it said.
With the exception of Sudan and Rwanda, the October - December 2016 rains failed in most countries in region. Contributing factors include the weak La Niña, which has just ended, and reduced moisture influx due to the cooling of the ocean water in the east African coast.
March to May is the main cropping season for many parts of the Greater Horn of Africa. The seasonal outlook is therefore of great importance to inform decision-making in climate sensitive sectors. The forum, attended by meteorological and climate experts and users from agriculture and food security, livestock, water resources, disaster risk management, Non- Governmental Organizations and development partner, took place in Addis Ababa from 6 to 7 February 2017.
The World Meteorological Organization supports regional climate outlook forums, which combine forecasting products from a variety of different models into a single consensus outlook. National meteorological services then downscale the regional outlook into national and local forecasts."
wildfires,"In the dry highlands of Arizona where Jeff Andrews manages wildfires, it’s shaping up to be another white-knuckle summer.
“Things are looking pretty bleak,” said Andrews, deputy fire staff officer for Prescott National Forest. “We had a good amount of rainfall in November and December, but January and February have been dry. It’s going to have a pretty significant impact on the fire season.”
It’s a similarly grim outlook for Don Muise, Andrews’ counterpart in the Coconino National Forest.
“I’ve been burned before by trying to make predictions,” Muise said. “But things aren’t lining up to be much better than last year.”
Predicting a fire season isn’t easy, but one of the biggest indicators is winter rain and snow, Muise said.
Snowpack covering the San Francisco Peaks in Coconino National Forest is at about 60 percent of what it normally is, while rainfall levels in the Verde Valley are about 50 percent of normal.
April, May and June are predicted to be the worst for forest fires, the officers said. The fire season typically begins in March _ when most of the fires are human-caused _ and ends with the monsoon season in August.
The summer of 2011 saw fires consume nearly 900,000 acres of U.S. Forest Service land in Arizona. The Wallow Fire alone burned through more than 538,000 acres over six weeks in eastern Arizona, making it the largest in state history."

Typhoon Molave, with wind speeds of 125kmh and gusts of up to 150kmh, left the main Philippine island of Luzon earlier on Monday, with heavy rain causing seven landslides and floods in 11 areas, the country's disaster monitoring agency said.  There were no reports of casualties, but 12 fishermen at sea failed to return to Catanduanes province off the eastern coast of Luzon.  Molave, the 17th typhoon to hit the Philippines this year, is expected to make landfall in central Vietnam on Wednesday, with wind speeds of up to 135kmh.  It will be the fourth storm to hit Vietnam in a tumultuous month during which floods and landslides have killed 130 people and left 20 missing in the central region.  Vietnam is prone to destructive storms and flooding due to its long coastline."

Indian drought 'affecting 330 million people' after two weak monsoons
The Kummaris are rice farmers. Rice is a water-intensive crop; it takes more than 2,500 litres of water to produce one kilo (pdf). Usually the Kummaris can harvest their crop twice a year but, since the drought, they’ve suffered enormous financial losses. “No one in the village had water,” Kummari says. “We had no choice but to come here.”
The drought has affected 330 million people in India this year, according to government figures. About 15% of India’s gross domestic product comes from agriculture and 68% of the 1.3 billion population are farmers. With no water for irrigation, the drought has been devastating for farmers. Like the Kummaris, hundreds of families have had to leave their lands in search of water.

But there was much activity behind this apparent inaction on the part of the RBI.As explained in last week¡¯s ExplainSpeaking, every two months, the RBI evaluates the outlook on economic growth and inflation. For inflation, it has a well laid out target ¡ª maintaining retail inflation at 4% with a leeway of 2 percentage points on either side. In other words, retail inflation can vary between 2% and 6% without the RBI needing to explain to the Parliament. On growth, there is no specific target.

Economic activity is expected to accelerate with the strengthening of investment activity, supported by consumption demand and robust credit growth.The Monetary Policy Report (MPR) of October 2017 flagged significant shifts underway in the macroeconomic environment. Some of them have gained traction since then while others are incipiently in motion. Global economic activity has continued to strengthen and is becoming increasingly synchronised across regions. Global trade is outpacing demand after lagging behind for two years. Oil prices have firmed up again on the edge of a delicate demand-supply balance. Generally buoyant global financial markets have been interrupted by bouts of volatility triggered by several event-specific announcement effects, and most recently by reassessments of the pace of monetary policy normalisation in the US. Renewed fears of protectionism, retaliatory actions and trade wars pose a major challenge to the global economy, with implications for emerging market economies (EMEs), including India, that are participating in open international trade and relying on foreign capital flows to realise their developmental aspirations."
wildfires,"Three people were confirmed dead Tuesday after a fire that destroyed more than 150 homes and businesses as flames whipped by high-speed winds raged overnight through town and displaced more than 14,000 residents in an inferno witnesses called unlike any in living memory.
It's the latest destruction by wildfires that officials estimate have consumed more than 15,000 acres in the Great Smoky Mountains. Smoke alarms still echoed through the empty streets on Tuesday night, almost 24 hours after the town was evacuated.

other,"On the domestic front, south-west monsoon has been recovering after a brief spell of deficiency in the second half of June. The cumulative rainfall up to July 31, 2018 was 6 per cent below the long-period average. In terms of spatial distribution, 28 of the 36 sub-divisions received normal or excess rainfall, whereas 8 sub-divisions received deficient rainfall as against three sub-divisions last year. The total sown area of kharif crops as on July 27 was 7.5 per cent lower than that a year ago. The live storage in major reservoirs as on July 26 was at 41 per cent of the full reservoir level compared with 36 per cent a year ago, which portends well for the rabi sowing season.Industrial growth, measured by the index of industrial production (IIP), strengthened in April-May 2018 on a y-o-y basis. This was driven mainly by a significant turnaround in the production of capital goods and consumer durables. Growth in the infrastructure/construction sector accelerated sharply, reflecting the government¡¯s thrust on national highways and rural housing, while the growth of consumer non-durables decelerated significantly. The output of eight core industries accelerated in June due to higher production in petroleum refinery products, steel, coal and cement. Capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector remains robust. The assessment based on the Reserve Bank¡¯s business expectations index (BEI) for Q1:2018-19 remained optimistic notwithstanding some softening in production, order books and exports. The July manufacturing PMI remained in expansion zone, although it eased from its level a month ago with slower growth in output, new orders and employment."
other,"The overall condition of the labor market continued to improve during the first half of 2014. Gains in payroll employment picked up to an average monthly pace of about 230,000, and the unemployment rate fell to 6.1 percent in June, nearly 4 percentage points below its peak in 2009. Notwithstanding those improvements, a broad array of labor market indicators--such as labor force participation, hiring and quit rates, and the number of people working part time for economic reasons--generally suggests that significant slack remains in the labor market. Continued slow increases in most measures of labor compensation also corroborate the view that labor resources are not being fully utilized."
other,"Growth in the Singapore economy has weakened and is not expected to pick up significantly in 2017. MAS Core Inflation will rise only gradually next year. Over the medium term, core inflation is still expected to trend towards but average slightly below 2%.  MAS will therefore maintain the rate of appreciation of the S$NEER policy band at zero percent. The width of the policy band and the level at which it is centred will be unchanged.  MAS assesses that a neutral policy stance will be needed for an extended period to ensure medium-term price stability. The current policy band provides some flexibility for the S$NEER to accommodate the near-term weakness in inflation and growth. MAS will continue to closely monitor economic developments as they evolve over the coming months."
other,"Economic activity continued to recover over the first half of 2011, but the pace of the expansion has been modest. The subdued rate of expansion reflects in part factors that are likely to be temporary, including the damping effect of higher food and energy prices on consumer spending as well as supply chain disruptions associated with the tragic earthquake in Japan. Nonetheless, even after setting aside temporary influences, the growth of economic activity appears to have slowed over the first half of this year. Conditions in the labor market remain weak. Although the average pace of job creation picked up during the early months of the year, employment growth softened in May and June and the unemployment rate edged up. Meanwhile, consumer price inflation increased noticeably in the first part of the year, reflecting in part higher prices for some commodities and imported goods as well as shortages of several popular models of automobiles. The recent rise in inflation is expected to subside as the effects of past increases in the prices of energy and other commodities dissipate in an environment of stable longer-term inflation expectations, and as supply chain disruptions in the automobile industry are remediated."
drought,"Since June 2015, Ethiopia has been affected by the worst drought in the last 30–50 years,with over 10.2 million people in need of food assistance as of December 2015, compared to 2.9 million in the beginning of 2015. In 2016, the number of people in need is expected to reach over 15 million.
Most of the regions of Amhara, Oromia, and SNNPR are reported to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) food insecurity. In the most affected areas, over 75% of meher cropping production has been lost, one million livestock have died, and over 1.7million are reportedly at risk due to bad body conditions. Meher cropping represents 90%of the country’s total grain production, which accounts for 80% of Ethiopian agriculture."
other,"For now, the eight-member panel unanimously voted against any increase in rates. The panel also maintained the bank¡¯s monetary stimulus at current levels though one of the eight members voted to reduce the level of asset purchases from 875 billion pounds ($1.2 billion) to 830 billion.Armed with quarterly economic projections, also published Thursday, the rate-setting panel said ¡°a waning impact¡± from COVID-19 would boost demand growth and help the British economy reach its pre-pandemic level by the end of the year.It said the British economy is set to rebound by 7.25% this year following the lifting of lockdown restrictions, unchanged from its previous projection. However, it modestly upgraded its forecast for next year to 6% from 5.75%.However, it cautioned that the more contagious delta variant, which has seen coronavirus infections spike sharply in the U.K. over the past couple of months, and voluntary social distancing could pose a risk to the outlook."
other,"I will now turn to monetary policy. Over the second half of 2019, the FOMC shifted to a more accommodative stance of monetary policy to cushion the economy from weaker global growth and trade developments and to promote a faster return of inflation to our symmetric 2 percent objective. We lowered the federal funds target range at our July, September, and October meetings, bringing the current target range to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. At our subsequent meetings, with some uncertainties surrounding trade having diminished and amid some signs that global growth may be stabilizing, the Committee left the policy rate unchanged. The FOMC believes that the current stance of monetary policy will support continued economic growth, a strong labor market, and inflation returning to the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective. As long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with this outlook, the current stance of monetary policy will likely remain appropriate. Of course, policy is not on a preset course. If developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly.Taking a longer view, there has been a decline over the past quarter-century in the level of interest rates consistent with stable prices and the economy operating at its full potential. This low interest rate environment may limit the ability of central banks to reduce policy interest rates enough to support the economy during a downturn. With this concern in mind, we have been conducting a review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices. Public engagement is at the heart of this effort. Through our Fed Listens events, we have been hearing from representatives of consumer, labor, business, community, and other groups. The February Monetary Policy Report shares some of what we have learned. The insights we have gained from these events have informed our framework discussions, as reported in the minutes of our meetings. We will share our conclusions when we finish the review, likely around the middle of the year.The current low interest rate environment also means that it would be important for fiscal policy to help support the economy if it weakens. Putting the federal budget on a sustainable path when the economy is strong would help ensure that policymakers have the space to use fiscal policy to assist in stabilizing the economy during a downturn. A more sustainable federal budget could also support the economy's growth over the long term.Finally, I will briefly review our planned technical operations to implement monetary policy. The February Monetary Policy Report provides details of our operations to date. Last October, the FOMC announced a plan to purchase Treasury bills and conduct repo operations. These actions have been successful in providing an ample supply of reserves to the banking system and effective control of the federal funds rate. As our bill purchases continue to build reserves toward levels that maintain ample conditions, we intend to gradually transition away from the active use of repo operations. Also, as reserves reach durably ample levels, we intend to slow our purchases to a pace that will allow our balance sheet to grow in line with trend demand for our liabilities. All of these technical measures support the efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy. They are not intended to represent a change in the stance of monetary policy. As always, we stand ready to adjust the details of our technical operations as conditions warrant."
earthquake,"Third Major Earthquake Near New Zealand Prompts Tsunami Alerts Update: A third large earthquake has struck north of New Zealand. An 8.1 magnitude happened near the Kermadec Islands Region around 11:30 PT. The epicenter is very close to the 7.4 preliminary magnitude earthquake that ruptured along the same fault as a 7.3 magnitude earthquake that struck early Friday local time. The second two, likely larger earthquakes, happened within hours after the first, but ruptured about 500 miles (800 km) farther from New Zealand’s North Island. The latest, largest quake prompted Tsunami Alerts across the Pacific, including American Samoa and Hawaii. These alerts are in addition to Tsunami Alerts for New Zealand."
wildfires,"Some residents cried as they walked through the rubble of their homes while others shared amazing stories of survival as more people returned to their houses Tuesday and surveyed the twisted metal and smoking ruins left behind by a devastating California wildfire.
Gary Herrin sobbed as he walked through what had been his childhood home in Middletown.
""Yep, grew up here, was able to walk to school from here. Many friends lived close by,"" Herrin recalled, looking around. ""There's a lot of good people here, but it's a ghost town now, it's really eerie.”
His brother had been living in the home and members of his extended family resided nearby.
""I go to my brother-in-law's house, my niece's house, and there's nothing, nothing, ashes,"" Herrin said.
A number of people saw the devastation for the first time since the massive flames sped Saturday through rural Lake County, less than 160 kilometres north of San Francisco.
Aided by drought, it has consumed more than 269 square kilometres and was 30 per cent contained.
Fire investigators working to determine what caused the massive blaze have narrowed their focus to an area in the community of Cobb, where the blaze was first spotted, said California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokesman Daniel Berlant.
What sparked the blaze remains under investigation, he said.
Authorities say 585 homes were known to be destroyed, and the number was expected to increase. Another 9,000 structures remained threatened.
The Lake County fire and another blaze about 193 kilometres to the southeast have displaced 23,000 people and were the worst of a dozen wildfires burning in the state. The Lake County fire spread into northern Napa County, but the region's famous wine valley was not threatened.
Rancher Lisa Comstock said she and her three dogs survived the raging fire in rural Middletown by jumping into a water trough as flames neared her home."
other,"On the supply side, the FAE have placed the growth of real gross value added (GVA) at 7.0 per cent in 2018-19 as compared with 6.9 per cent in 2017-18. The estimates incorporated a slowdown in agricultural GVA growth and an acceleration in industrial GVA growth. Services GVA growth is set to soften due to subdued activity in trade, hotels, transport, communication and other services. Growth in public administration and defence services is also likely to moderate.Rabi sowing so far (up to February 1, 2019) has been lower than in the previous year, but the overall shortfall of 4.0 per cent across various crops is expected to catch up as the season comes to a close. The lower rabi sowing reflects a deficient north-east monsoon (44 per cent below the long period average); however, storage in major reservoirs _ the main source of irrigation during the rabi season _ at 44 per cent of the full reservoir level (as on January 31, 2019) was marginally higher than in the previous year. The extended period of cold weather in this year¡¯s winter is likely to boost wheat yields, which would partly offset the shortfall, if any, in area sown.After exhibiting an uptick in the festive month of October, industrial activity, measured by the index of industrial production (IIP), slowed down in November. The year-on-year (y-o-y) growth in core industries decelerated to 2.6 per cent (y-o-y) in December, pulled down by a slowdown in the production of electricity and coal; and contraction in petroleum refinery products, crude oil and fertilisers output. Capacity utilisation (CU) in the manufacturing sector, as measured by the Reserve Bank¡¯s order books, inventory and capacity utilisation survey (OBICUS), increased to 74.8 per cent in Q2 from 73.8 per cent in Q1; seasonally adjusted CU also improved to 75.3 per cent from 74.9 per cent. While the Reserve Bank¡¯s business assessment index of the industrial outlook survey (IOS) for Q3:2018-19 suggests a weakening of demand conditions in the manufacturing sector, the business expectations index (BEI) points to an improvement in Q4. The manufacturing purchasing managers¡¯ index (PMI) for January remained in expansion on the back of increased output and new orders.High-frequency indicators of the services sector suggest some moderation in the pace of activity. Sales of motorcycles and tractors imply weakening of rural demand in December. Sales of passenger cars _ an indicator of urban demand _ contracted, possibly reflecting volatility in fuel prices and mandated long-term insurance premium payments. Commercial vehicle sales also shrank in December 2018 from a high base of the previous year. Lead indicators for the hotels sub-segment, viz., foreign tourist arrivals and air passenger traffic, point to softening in November-December. In the communication sub-segment, the telephone subscriber base contracted in October-November, while that of broadband continued to expand in October. The services PMI continued to expand in January 2019 despite a dip from the previous month. Indicators of the construction sector, viz., consumption of steel and production of cement, continued to show healthy growth, though growth in cement production inched lower in November 2018, reflecting a base effect."
Typhoon,"Typhoon Haikui had been downgraded to a severe tropical storm as of 4 p.m. Wednesday in east China's Zhejiang province and will soon enter neighboring Anhui province, the provincial flood control and drought relief headquarters said.
Typhoon Haikui, which made landfall in Zhejiang at 3:20 a.m. Wednesday, has brought heavy downpours to east China and killed three people there.
Shanghai was lashed by a typhoon-triggered rainstorm, with maximum precipitation approaching 130 mm in some areas, the local observatory said.
Two people died and seven were injured by Typhoon-triggered accidents in Shanghai, according to the city's flood control and draught relief headquarters.
Around 7 a.m., a woman died after being hit in the head by a piece of falling glass in Baoshan district. At 11 a.m., the wall of a factory in Songjiang district collapsed and fell onto a neighboring dormitory, killing one and injuring three in the dormitory."
Typhoon,"A powerful typhoon has struck South Korea, killing at least eight people, including five fishermen. Strong winds and heavy rain churned up rough seas and smashed two fishing ships on to rocks, forcing the coastguard to perform a daring rescue of the survivors.
Twelve fishermen were saved and rescuers were still searching for 10 missing from the Chinese ships, which hit rocks off South Korea's southern Jeju island.
At least three other people died as Typhoon Bolaven knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of South Koreans, cancelled flights and temporarily halted joint war games by US and South Korean military forces.
State media in North Korea, which is still struggling to rebuild from recent floods and a devastating drought, reported on Tuesday that the country was being lashed by heavy rain and strong winds.
Off Jeju island, dangerous waves prevented rescue boats from approaching the Chinese fishing ships. The coastguard used a special gun to shoot rope to one ship so officers could pull themselves over and bring the fishermen back to shore, coastguard spokesman Ko Chang-keon said.
Of the 18 fishermen who survived, six swam or were washed ashore."
other,"In the sixth bi-monthly resolution of February 2020, CPI headline inflation was projected at 6.5 per cent for Q4:2019-20. The prints for January and February 2020 indicate that actual outcomes for the quarter are running 30 bps above projections, reflecting the onion price shock. Looking ahead, food prices may soften even further under the beneficial effects of the record foodgrains and horticulture production, at least till the onset of the usual summer uptick. Furthermore, the collapse in crude prices should work towards easing both fuel and core inflation pressures, depending on the level of the pass-through to retail prices. As a consequence of COVID-19, aggregate demand may weaken and ease core inflation further. Heightened volatility in financial markets could also have a bearing on inflation.Turning to growth, apart from the continuing resilience of agriculture and allied activities, most other sectors of the economy will be adversely impacted by the pandemic, depending upon its intensity, spread and duration. If COVID-19 is prolonged and supply chain disruptions get accentuated, the global slowdown could deepen, with adverse implications for India. The slump in international crude prices could, however, provide some relief in the form of terms of trade gains. Downside risks to growth arise from the spread of COVID-19 and prolonged lockdowns. Upside growth impulses are expected to emanate from monetary, fiscal and other policy measures and the early containment of COVID-19.The MPC is of the view that macroeconomic risks, both on the demand and supply sides, brought on by the pandemic could be severe. The need of the hour is to do whatever is necessary to shield the domestic economy from the pandemic. Central banks across the world have responded with monetary and regulatory measures _ both conventional and unconventional. Governments across the world have unleashed massive fiscal measures, including targeted health services support, to protect economic activity from the impact of the virus. To mitigate the economic difficulties arising out of the virus outbreak, the Government of India has announced a comprehensive package of _ 1.70 lakh crore, covering cash transfers and food security, for vulnerable sections of society, including farmers, migrant workers, urban and rural poor, differently abled persons and women. The MPC notes that the Reserve Bank has taken several measures to inject substantial liquidity in the system. Nonetheless, the priority is to undertake strong and purposeful action in order to minimise the adverse macroeconomic impact of the pandemic. It is in this context that the MPC unanimously votes for a sizable reduction in the policy repo rate, but with some differences in the quantum of reduction. Furthermore, the MPC also notes that the Reserve Bank has decided to undertake several measures to further improve liquidity, monetary transmission and credit flows to the economy and provide relief on debt servicing. It also underscores the need for all stakeholders to fight against the pandemic. Banks and other financial institutions should do all they can to keep credit flowing to economic agents facing financial stress on account of the isolation that the virus has imposed. Market participants should work with regulators like the Reserve Bank and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to ensure the orderly functioning of markets in their role of price discovery and financial intermediation. Strong fiscal measures are critical to deal with the situation.All members voted for a reduction in the policy repo rate and maintaining the accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target."
other,"In the fifth bi-monthly resolution of December 2019, CPI inflation was projected at 5.1-4.7 per cent for H2:2019-20 and 4.0-3.8 per cent for H1:2020-21, with risks broadly balanced. The actual inflation outcome for Q2 at 5.8 per cent overshot projections by 70 bps, primarily due to the intensification of the onion price shock in December 2019 on account of unseasonal rains in October-November.Going forward, the inflation outlook is likely to be influenced by several factors. First, food inflation is likely to soften from the high levels of December and the decline is expected to become more pronounced during Q4:2019-20 as onion prices fall rapidly in response to arrivals of late kharif and rabi harvests. Higher vegetables production, despite the early loss due to unseasonal rain, is also likely to have a salutary impact on food inflation. On the other hand, the recent pick-up in prices of non-vegetable food items, specifically in milk due to a rise in input costs, and in pulses due to a shortfall in kharif production, are all likely to sustain. These factors could impart some upward bias to overall food prices. Second, crude prices are likely to remain volatile due to unabating geo-political tensions in the Middle East on the one hand, and the uncertain global economic outlook on the other. Third, there has been an increase in input costs for services, in recent months. However, subdued demand conditions, muted pricing power of corporates and the correction in energy prices since the last week of January may limit the pass-through to selling prices. Fourth, domestic financial markets remain volatile reflecting both global and domestic factors, which may have an influence on the inflation outlook. Fifth, base effects would turn favourable during Q3:2020-21. Sixth, the increase in customs duties on items of retail consumption in the budget may result in only a marginal one-time uptick in inflation. Taking into consideration these factors, and under the assumption of a normal south west monsoon in 2020-21, the CPI inflation projection is revised upwards to 6.5 per cent for Q4:2019-20; 5.4-5.0 per cent for H1:2020-21; and 3.2 per cent for Q3:2020-21, with risks broadly balanced (Chart 1).Turning to the growth outlook, real GDP growth for 2019-20 was projected in the December 2019 policy at 5.0 per cent _ 4.9-5.5 per cent in H2. GDP growth for H1:2020-21 was projected at 5.9-6.3 per cent. For 2020-21, the growth outlook will be influenced by several factors. First, private consumption, particularly in rural areas, is expected to recover on the back of improved rabi prospects. The recent rise in food prices has shifted the terms of trade in favour of agriculture, which will support rural incomes. Second, the easing of global trade uncertainties should encourage exports and spur investment activity. The breakout of the coronavirus may, however, impact tourist arrivals and global trade. Third, monetary transmission in terms of a reduction in lending rates and financial flows to the commercial sector has progressed vis-¨¤-vis the last policy, and this could spur both consumption and investment demand. Fourth, the rationalisation of personal income tax rates in the Union Budget 2020-21 should support domestic demand along with measures to boost rural and infrastructure spending. Taking into consideration the above factors, GDP growth for 2020-21 is projected at 6.0 per cent _ in the range of 5.5-6.0 per cent in H1 and 6.2 per cent in Q3 (Chart 2).The MPC notes that inflation has surged above the upper tolerance band around the target in December 2019, primarily on the back of the unusual spike in onion prices. Over the coming weeks and months, onion prices are likely to ebb as supply conditions improve. The salutary effects on headline inflation are, however, likely to be tempered by hardening of prices of other food items, notably those of pulses and proteins. Meanwhile adjustments to telecom charges are imparting cost-push pressures to CPI inflation excluding food and fuel. Going forward, the trajectory of inflation excluding food and fuel needs to be carefully monitored as the pass-through of remaining revisions in mobile phone charges, the increase in prices of drugs and pharmaceuticals and the impact of new emission norms play out and feed into inflation formation. The MPC anticipates that the combination of these factors may keep headline inflation elevated in the short-run, at least through H1:2020-21. Overall, the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain. Accordingly, the MPC will remain vigilant about the potential generalisation of inflationary pressures as several of the underlying factors cited earlier appear to be operating in concert.At the same time, the MPC observes that the economy continues to be weak and the output gap remains negative. While some high-frequency indicators have turned around and point to a lift in the momentum of economic activity, there is a need to await incoming data to gauge their sustainability. Financial flows to the commercial sector have improved in recent months. The Union Budget 2020-21 has introduced several measures to provide an impetus to growth. While the emphasis on boosting the rural economy and infrastructure should help the growth momentum in the near-term, the corporate tax rate cuts of September 2019 should help boost the growth potential over the medium-term. The fiscal deficit of the Central Government for 2019-20 is placed at 3.8 per cent of GDP in the revised estimates as against 3.3 per cent of GDP in the budget estimates. The higher fiscal deficit in 2019-20 has not resulted in an increase in market borrowings compared to the budget estimates. The fiscal deficit is budgeted to decline to 3.5 per cent of GDP for 2020-21. Fresh gross market borrowings are budgeted to increase by _ 70,000 crore to _ 7.8 lakh crore in 2020-21 from _ 7.1 lakh crore in 2019-20. The MPC notes that while there is a need for adjustment in interest rates on small saving schemes, the external benchmark system introduced from October 1, 2019 has strengthened monetary transmission. These developments should amplify the effects of the cumulative policy rate reductions undertaken by the Reserve Bank since February 2019 and pull up domestic demand going forward.The outlook for inflation is highly uncertain at this juncture. On the other hand, economic activity remains subdued and the few indicators that have moved up recently are yet to gain traction in a more broad-based manner. Given the evolving growth-inflation dynamics, the MPC felt it appropriate to maintain status quo. Accordingly, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged and persevere with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive growth, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target."
other,"Additional testing is planned after Kentucky Derby winner Medina Spirit failed a postrace drug test, throwing the horse's victory at Churchill Downs earlier this month into doubt.
Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert revealed the test results Sunday, saying the 3-year-old colt tested positive for elevated levels of betamethasone, which is an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid and sometimes used to relieve joint pain in horses.
Betamethasone is allowed in horse racing in certain amounts, but Baffert said he'd been informed Medina Spirit's postrace test detected 21 picograms per milliliter -- more than double the allowed limit in Kentucky within 14 days of a race.
""I feel so bad not only for the horse, you know, but the owner, everybody involved, because this is something that, you know, we didn't do,"" Baffert told CNN's Carolyn Manno on Monday, adding that he planned not to go to the Preakness Stakes on Saturday.
The test revelation came just over a week after Medina Spirit won the Kentucky Derby in Louisville, beating second-place Mandaloun by half a length. The win delivered Baffert a record seventh Derby victory.
A split sample from Medina Spirit's postrace blood sample will now be tested, and if the original results are confirmed, Baffert will have a chance to appeal.
The time frame for receiving the results from a requested split sample averages four to eight weeks, but could take up to six months, according to the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission."
other,"By early November, conditions in financial markets had firmed somewhat on reports of improved corporate profitability. But on November 6, with economic performance remaining subpar, the Federal Open Market Committee chose to ease the stance of monetary policy, reducing the federal funds rate 50 basis points, to 1_ percent. We viewed that action as insurance against the possibility that the still widespread weakness would become entrenched. With inflation expectations well contained, this additional monetary stimulus seemed to offer worthwhile insurance against the threat of persistent economic weakness and unwelcome substantial declines in inflation from already low levelsIn the weeks that followed, financial market conditions continued to improve, but only haltingly. The additional monetary stimulus and the absence of further revelations of major corporate wrongdoing seemed to provide some reassurance to investors. Equity prices rose, volatility declined, risk spreads narrowed, and market liquidity increased, albeit not to levels that might be associated with robust economic conditions. At the same time, mounting concerns about geopolitical risks and energy supplies, amplified by the turmoil in Venezuela, were mirrored by the worrisome surge in oil prices, continued skittishness in financial markets, and substantial uncertainty among businesses about the outlook.Partly as a result, growth of economic activity slowed markedly late in the summer and in the fourth quarter, continuing the choppy pattern that prevailed over the past year. According to the advance estimate, real GDP expanded at an annual rate of only _ percent last quarter after surging 4 percent in the third quarter. Much of that deceleration reflected a falloff in the production of motor vehicles from the near-record level that had been reached in the third quarter when low financing rates and other incentive programs sparked a jump in sales. The slowing in aggregate output also reflected aggressive attempts by businesses more generally to ensure that inventories remained under control. Thus far, those efforts have proven successful in that business inventories, with only a few exceptions, have stayed lean--a circumstance that should help support production this year. Indeed, after dropping back a bit in the fall, manufacturing activity turned up in December, and reports from purchasing managers suggest that improvement has continued into this year. Excluding both the swings in auto and truck production and the fluctuations in non-motor-vehicle inventories, economic activity has been moving up in a considerably smoother fashion than has overall real GDP: Final sales excluding motor vehicles are estimated to have risen at a 2_ percent annual rate in the fourth quarter after a similar 1_ percent advance in the previous quarter and an average of 2 percent in the first half."
other,"The Reserve Bank had in November 2009 issued directions regarding maintenance of nodal accounts of intermediaries like payment gateway providers and payment aggregators. In the ¡°Payment and Settlement Systems - Vision 2018¡± Document, the Reserve Bank had indicated that given the increasing role and importance of such entities, these guidelines would be revised. Accordingly, the Reserve Bank has been examining the need and feasibility of regulating Payment Gateway Service Providers and Payment Aggregators. A discussion paper on comprehensive guidelines covering payments related activities of these entities will be placed in the public domain for consultation with the stakeholders.Agricultural credit growth has been significant over the years. In spite of this, there remain issues relating to agricultural credit such as regional disparity, extent of coverage, etc. There is also the issue of deepening long-term agricultural credit for capital formation. To examine these issues and arrive at workable solutions and policy initiatives, an Internal Working Group (IWG) to Review Agricultural Credit has been constituted by the Reserve Bank.Presently the banks are mandated to extend collateral-free agriculture loans up to _ 1 lakh. This limit of _ 1 lakh was fixed in the year 2010. Keeping in view the overall inflation and rise in agriculture input costs since then, it has been decided to raise the limit for collateral__free agriculture loans from _ 1 lakh to _ 1.6 lakh. This will enhance coverage of small and marginal farmers in the formal credit system. The circular to this effect will be issued shortly."
wildfires,"During the July 4 weekend, the U.S. Forest Service issued urgent instructions to hikers and campers to be exceedingly cautious in lighting campfires across California’s tinder dry Sierra Nevada mountain range. Embers that escaped almost two years ago from a campfire in the thickly wooded slopes east of this Gold Rush era town ignited the 104,000-hectare (257,000-acre) Rim Fire that burned for two months and is ranked by Cal Fire, a state firefighting agency, as the third largest wildfire in California’s history.
All across the 640-kilometer (400-mile) Sierra range, which runs nearly the length of California’s eastern border, state and federal forest agencies are preparing for a miserable season of fire. The same is true across much of the American West and Alaska where winter snows, and spring and early summer rain, have been scant."
other,"Overall, growth is expected to slow toward more normal rates in the months and years to come, partly reflecting lower government spending as many pandemic programs, such as a salary support scheme, end.One uncertainty cited was how the economy will adjust to the end of the furlough scheme, which was introduced at the start of the pandemic last March to ensure unemployment didn¡¯t rise substantially when lockdown restrictions were imposed. Under the program, the government paid 80% of the salaries of those workers unable to work because of lockdown measures.The program, which is being phased out and due to end at the end of September, helped support over 11 million people but the number now is down below the 2 million mark as many sectors have reopened, notably hospitality. It kept a lid on unemployment, which remains relatively low at below 5%."
valcano eruption,"Philippines: Taal Volcano Eruption - Emergency Plan of Action (EPoA) DREF n° MDRPH039 On 12 January 2020, the Department of Science and Technology’s Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (DOST- PHIVOLCS) raised an Alert Level from 1 to 4 after increasing activity of Taal Volcano, which is located on the island of Luzon in Batangas, CALABARZON (Region IV-A). An Alert Level 4 means that a hazardous explosive eruption is possible within hours to days; and warrants a “Danger Zone” of up to 14 kilometres from the main crater. Approximately 459,300 people are living within the 14 kilometres Danger Zone (OCHA). Taal Volcano is among the most active volcanoes in the Philippines, with more than 30 reported eruptions. According to DOST- PHIVOLCS, eruptive activity at Taal Volcano main crater has intensified, with continuous eruptions generating a 15 kilometre of steam laden cloud of super-heated ash, with frequent volcanic lightning that has rained wet ashfall as far as Quezon City, some 100 kilometres away. This has subsequently progressed to a magmatic eruption accompanied by thunder and more lightning early Monday morning."

It is thought to be the first-ever legal settlement of its kind.
Under the terms of the deal, claimants will be given compensation based on court-determined level of harm.
Money will also be set aside for a DNA database to allow dozens of children to identify their biological fathers.
The class-action lawsuit currently includes 226 people. Dr Barwin worked at two clinics in Ottawa, Ontario.
Some couples who were told that the male partner's sperm would be used were unknowingly given random samples, and in some cases, the doctor's own.
Some of the claims date back to the 1970s. Dr Barwin is now in his 80s and has not practiced since 2014.
The settlement must still be approved by a judge before any money will be made available.
Rebecca Dixon, 31, found out that her real father was Dr Barwin - whose clinic her parents had visited - after she developed a disease that nobody else in her family had. She and her parents launched the lawsuit in 2016.
""I am not sure we will ever achieve closure,"" she told the Ottawa-Citizen newspaper.
""It is something that will be with us for the rest of our lives. But the legal side wrapping up will allow people to come to a bit more peace with the situation.""
The proposal also calls for C$75,000 to be used to set up a database for children conceived at his clinics to find out the identity of their father. The purpose of the database will be to provide children with the opportunity to identify their biological fathers, gain access to medical history and to locate any half-siblings.
Dr Barwin and his lawyer had no comment on the matter, but the settlement does not require the former fertility doctor to admit any fault.
He ""has denied and continues to deny all of the plaintiffs' claims in this action,"" lawyers said in court documents filed on Wednesday.
In 2019, Dr Barwin was stripped of his medical license by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, which called his actions ""beyond reprehensible""."
other,"The pace of economic recovery appears to have slowed during the first half of this year, with real gross domestic product (GDP) likely having risen at only a modest pace. In the labor market, the rate of job gains has diminished recently, and, following a period of improvement, the unemployment rate has been little changed at an elevated level since January. Meanwhile, consumer price inflation over the first five months of 2012 was lower, on net, than in 2011, and longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. A number of factors will likely restrain economic growth in the period ahead, including weak economic growth abroad and a fiscal environment that looks set to become less accommodative. Uncertainty about these factors may also restrain household and business spending. In addition, credit conditions are likely to improve only gradually, as are still-elevated inventories of vacant and foreclosed homes. Moreover, the possibility of a further material deterioration of conditions in Europe, or of a particularly severe change in U.S. fiscal conditions, poses significant downside risks to the outlook."
earthquake,"A strong earthquake with a magnitude of 7.0 jolted eastern and northeastern Japan on Sunday, but there were no immediate reports of injuries or damages and no tsunami warning was issued.
The earthquake measured 4 in central Tokyo, Fukushima and their surrounding areas on the Japanese intensity scale, which measures ground motion, according to Japan Meteorological Agency, which uses a different measuring system than the U.S. Geological Survey.
A spokesman for Tokyo Electric Power said there were no reports of any abnormalities at the tsunami-crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plan following the quake.
Some high-speed train services in northern Japan were suspended after the earthquake, but soon resumed operations, Kyodo news reported.
The 7.0 magnitude earthquake, at a depth of nearly 217 miles, was recorded off Japan’s southeastern Izu islands on Sunday at 0527 GMT, the U.S. Geological Survey reported.
The Hawaii-based U.S. Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has not issued a tsunami warning following the earthquake located south-southwest of Hachijo-jima in the Izu islands.
Earthquakes are common in Japan, one of the world’s most seismically active areas. The country accounts for about 20 percent of the world’s earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater.
On March 11, 2011, the northeast coast was struck by a magnitude 9 earthquake, the strongest quake in Japan on record, and a massive tsunami, which triggered the world’s worst nuclear crisis in 25 years since Chernobyl.
The disaster left up to 23,000 dead or missing."

With the slowdown in demand, growth in the Singapore economy could fall below its potential rate of 3-5%.  Thus, core inflation should ease next year, although headline inflation could stay elevated in the near term reflecting the higher imputed rental cost of owner-occupied housing.MAS will continue with the policy of a modest and gradual appreciation of the S$NEER policy band in the period ahead.  However, given the expected moderation in core inflation, the slope of the policy band will be reduced, with no change to the width of the band and the level at which it is centred."
Typhoon,"Chinese authorities say at least three people have died and 1,200 homes have collapsed as Typhoon Fitow slammed into the country's east coast.
Typhoon Fitow barrelled into China's east coast early on Monday, packing winds of more than 200 kilometres an hour, state media reported.
At least three people were reported killed, all of them near the city of Wenzhou in Zhejiang province, the state broadcaster CCTV said.
One of the victims, 55-year-old Ni Wenlin, died ""after strong wind blew him off a hill"" late Sunday, Xinhua news agency said, citing municipal flood control authorities.
Another person died of electric shock, CCTV said.
In the hard-hit county of Cangnan in Wenzhou, more than 1,200 homes collapsed and damages amounted to hundreds of millions of yuan, China National Radio said.
The threat of the storm has forced about half a million people from their homes in China's Zhejiang province and tens of thousands more in the country's Fujiian province.
Thousands of fishermen were recalled to port and transport services in 35 cities have been affected with the suspension of train services."
earthquake,"Hundreds are dead after the worst earthquake in generations struck off the northeast coast of Japan on Friday, setting off a devastating tsunami that swallowed swaths of coastal territory and fanned out across the Pacific Ocean, threatening everything in its path.
The 8.9-magnitude earthquake -- the world’s fifth-largest since 1900 and the biggest in Japan in 140 years -- struck at 2:46 p.m. local time, shaking buildings violently in Tokyo for several minutes and sending millions fleeing for higher ground.
Nearby islands are bracing for the tsunami and warnings have been issued for 53 countries including ones as far as Colombia and Peru.
The Kyodo News service reported police finding up to 300 bodies in the city of Sendai in Miyagi prefecture, a part of northeastern Japan believed to have been hit hardest by the tsunami.
The city of 1 million was struck by a wave 20 feet high, then another 33 feet high. A hotel collapsed and large ships in port were seen lying on their sides.
About 1,100 people were stranded and awaiting help in Sendai’s airport terminal, according to state-funded broadcaster NHK. The airport had no power and was dark. The runway and roads surrounding the airport were submerged under a layer of muddy water."
Typhoon,"Typhoon Haiyan has made landfall in Vietnam, days after leaving thousands feared dead and widespread devastation in the Philippines, meteorologists confirm.
The national weather forecaster said Haiyan made landfall in northern province of Quang Ninh at5:00am local time_n Monday (22:00 GMT on Sunday)_s a tropical storm. It was moving towards southern China and is expected to weaken to a low depression later on Monday.
Downpours hit the capital, Hanoi, and houses in some northern provinces were damaged by strong winds.
“Several hundred houses had their roofs ripped off. Thousands of trees in the province were uprooted,” said Nguyen Cong Thuan, a disaster official in Quang Ninh province.
“Three people were reported missing,” he added.
National disaster officials said no deaths had been reported so far on Monday, although state media said five people had died during preparations for the typhoon.
Haiyan has weakened significantly since scything through the Philippines at the weekend, and had sustained winds of 120km per hour as it hit Vietnam. That was down from winds of over 300km per hour when the storm hit the Philippines, devastating Leyte and Samar provinces, as well as other areas.
More than 600,000 Vietnamese were evacuated from their homes at the weekend as Haiyan bore down on Vietnam.
The storm changed course on Sunday, prompting further mass evacuations of about 52,000 people in northern provinces by the coast.
“People must bring enough food and necessities for three days. Those who do not move voluntarily will be forced,” online newspaper_NExpress_aid, adding all boats have been ordered back to shore.
All schools were ordered shut in the capital Monday and extra police were dispatched to redirect traffic in flood-prone areas."
drought,"Lake Velence, a shallow, freshwater lake in central Hungary, is a haven for over 100 types of birds, dozens of species of fish and throngs of tourists who come to bathe in its waters for relief from the hot summers.
But many of the lake’s visitors, both animal and human, have disappeared as extreme heat has brought the water to dangerously low levels, something activists and environmental experts say threatens the country’s third largest natural lake with an economic and ecological crisis.
They say climate change and insufficient infrastructure are colliding, with devastating effect. The lake has lost nearly half of its water in the past two years as hot, dry summers have led to accelerating evaporation and deteriorating water quality.
“We are talking about years of rainfall deficit, drought and a continuous water shortage,” said environmental management engineer and activist Tibor Horanyi. “For years we’ve seen what role global warming is playing in our lives, and it’s clearly connected to this low water level.”
The optimal water level for Lake Velence (pronounced 'VEH-len-tseh) in August is 150 centimeters (5 feet), according to the local water authority.
But on Thursday, the water level stood at 80 centimeters (2 feet 7 inches), an amount of water that Horanyi called “critical.”
Hot, dry weather can result in as much as 1 centimeter per day evaporating from Lake Velence, according to official measurements. Those decreased levels have meant water temperatures are rising faster, causing diminished oxygen content, increased proliferation of algae and reduced water quality.
Following a long, cold spring, Hungary experienced its third hottest June since 1901 and then the hottest July on record, according to the national meteorological service.
The extreme heat caused the water temperature in the lake to rise by 10 degrees Celsius (18 F) within a week in June, Horanyi said, resulting in the death of more than four tonnes (8,800 pounds) of fish that were then removed by volunteers."

It now believes output in June will only be about 2.5% below the fourth quarter of 2019, just before the pandemic triggered a recession.The U.K. experienced one of the world¡¯s deepest recessions last year as three successive lockdowns hobbled the economy."
Typhoon,"Heavy rain and a cyclonic storm are likely at several places in the western parts of India, warned the India Meteorological Department (IMD) in its latest weather forecast on Thursday. The stormy weather is due to a low pressure area over the Arabian Sea. According to the IMD, this is likely to intensify into a cyclonic storm by May 16, and some places in Goa and south Konkan region may see very heavy rainfall. ""A low pressure area has formed over the southeast Arabian Sea and adjoining Lakshadweep area today. It is very likely to become well marked over Lakshadweep area by Friday morning,"" the weather office said. The conditions may result in a depression by Saturday morning and intensify into a cyclonic storm in the next 24 hours.

other,"China's coronavirus vaccination drive has surpassed 2 billion doses, authorities announced Friday, but heavy-handed tactics intended to boost inoculation rates are triggering backlash in some areas.
As of Thursday, more than 889 million people had been fully vaccinated, with more than two billion shots of domestically-produced Covid-19 administered in total, an official at the National Health Commission said at a press conference Friday. That puts China on par with the United Kingdom and ahead of the United States in terms of the percentage of its population that are now fully vaccinated.
The 2 billion milestone came just 10 weeks after the country passed its first billion mark in June, with China now accounting for 40% of the 5 billion shots given globally.
China's push to boost vaccination rates has accelerated since July, when the highly contagious Delta variant sent infections rising across the country. On Friday, health officials announced that the outbreak had been ""effectively brought under control,"" with case numbers decreasing for 11 straight days since August 16, but the inoculation drive has continued to gather pace.
Speaking at a health conference last Friday, China's top respiratory expert Zhong Nanshan said the country is aiming to fully vaccinate 80% of its 1.4 billion population by the end of the year."
earthquake,"A magnitude-5.2 earthquake occurred in central Papua New Guinea, at around 2016 Dec. 18. The epicenter was in northeastern Morobe Province, approximately 67 km (42 miles) northeast of Lae. The tremor occurred at a depth of about 47 km (29 miles). Weak-to-light shaking was probably felt throughout Morobe Province, eastern sections of Eastern Highlands Province, southeastern areas of Madang Province, and western parts of Western New Britain Province. There have been no initial reports of damage or casualties as a result of the earthquake. It could take several hours until authorities can conduct comprehensive damage assessments, especially in remote areas. Aftershocks are possible over the coming days.
Officials may temporarily shut down transportation infrastructure in the tremor zone to check for damage. Minor disruptions could occur during shutdowns, but service will likely resume quickly if officials find no damage. Utility outages are possible, particularly near the earthquake's epicenter and coastal areas of affected provinces. Landslides are possible in mountain areas and could block roads, exacerbating ground transport disruptions."
other,"Underlying cost conditions have mostly co-moved with measures of inflation, ticking up in H2:2017-18, notwithstanding some moderation in Q4. Y-o-y growth in farm input costs slipped temporarily into negative territory in January 2018 (Chart II.18). The rise in global crude oil prices and the hardening of metal prices fuelled the rise in input costs from August 2017 onwards and contributed to the turnaround in domestic non-farm input costs as they got passed on to inputs such as high speed diesel, aviation turbine fuel, naptha, bitumen, furnace oil and lube oils.Among other industrial raw materials, domestic coal inflation generally remained high during the year, tracking the surge in international coal prices and domestic supply shortages. However, inflation in other inputs depicted a mixed behaviour. In the case of oilseeds, inflation picked up during H2:2017-18, whereas in the case of fibres and paper and pulp, inflation moderated during the same period. Inflation in electricity, which carries a high weight in both industrial and farm inputs, rose during September-October 2017, but turned negative thereafter. Among other farm sector inputs, diesel prices increased sharply from August 2017, mirroring international prices, while prices of inputs such as tractors and fodder increased sharply in February 2018 after contracting in the preceding months. Fertiliser prices also recorded some upward pressure during December-February.Going forward, a key risk to the inflation outlook is the risk of fiscal slippages in a scenario of rising aggregate demand. As noted in the MPC resolution of February 2018, apart from the direct impact on inflation, the fiscal risks could also engender a broader weakening of macro-financial conditions. The revised guidelines for arriving at the MSPs for kharif crops proposed in the Union Budget 2018-19, along with proposed increase in customs duty on a number of items, is likely to push-up inflation over the year. In addition, how various state governments implement and disburse HRA increases would have a considerable bearing on CPI housing inflation and consequently on the headline inflation trajectory, albeit statistically, during 2018-19; therefore, the latter should be looked through for monetary policy purposes, other than for their second-round effects. Although the central government's HRA effects on CPI inflation would gradually wane from July 2018, this moderating impact could be more than offset if several state governments simultaneously implement HRA increases in H2:2018-19 (Chapter 1)."
wildfires,"Alberta has called in hundreds of extra firefighters to battle a fire that was still considered out of control Monday after destroying 40 per cent of the town of Slave Lake — and forcing thousands of people to flee their homes.
Most of the destruction happened in the southeastern section of town, where half the homes were consumed by flames Sunday. The mall, town hall and many downtown businesses were destroyed.
The fire was still considered out of control as of 6 p.m. MT Monday.
Almost all 7,000 residents have been evacuated from the town, hundreds going to evacuation shelters in Athabasca, Westlock and Edmonton.
As of Monday evening, about 800 to 1,000 people were at the Athabasca shelter, 195 were in Edmonton and 46 people were staying in Westlock. Provincial officials said there is room for more people in all three locations.
Premier Ed Stelmach toured the fire zone Monday afternoon. He said the province will help fire victims but that people need to be patient before they return.
""I know it's difficult because everybody's really concerned about their home and whether there's damage, or burnt to the ground and what's salvagable,"" he said.
""It has to be done orderly, because it is a very large area and we want to make sure that anybody coming back here is safe.""
Stelmach struck a task force of governmental ministries and agencies to deal with the immediate needs of the community and to provide support services to the residents of Slave Lake over the coming days, weeks and months.
Stelmach said he spoke with Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who offered assistance. Stelmach said provincial employees are at the evacuation centres to get an idea of what sort of help the burned-out residents need.
Reporters were also taken on a tour of the town Monday, where they saw homes burned to their foundations, charred rubble and at least 100 burned-out vehicles."
Typhoon,"Nesat, the strongest typhoon to hit China this year, landed in South China's Hainan province Thursday afternoon.
Packing winds of 42 meters per second at its center, it made landfall in the township of Wengtian in Wenchang City at 2:30 pm
The province has recalled ships, suspended flight and ferry services and closed schools to brace for Nesat, which is the 17th typhoon to hit China this year.
To ensure the safety of the children, all kindergartens, primary and middle schools in Haikou, capital of Hainan, suspended classes from Thursday noon to Friday.
Passenger ferry services across the Qiongzhou Strait have been suspended since Wednesday, while railway services stopped Thursday morning.
Meilan Airport in Haikou canceled 49 flights Thursday, while 18 were canceled in the city of Sanya.
Hainan has stopped selling bus tickets and encouraged passengers who plan to take buses in the next two days to return their tickets.
Chen Cheng, vice governor of the Hainan, ordered all fishing boats to return to harbor and fishermen to take shelter ashore.
In Wenchang, where the typhoon is expected to land Thursday afternoon, 2,606 fishing boats were recalled to harbor, while 31,323 people were evacuated.
The typhoon led to the death of at least 35 in the Philippines."
Typhoon,"Tropical Storm Cristobal bears down on U.S. Gulf Coast Louisiana, Gov. John Bel Edwards has declared a state of emergency to prepare for the storm’s possible arrival. NEW ORLEANS — A re-energized Tropical Storm Cristobal continued its advance toward the U.S. Gulf Coast early Sunday, having spawned a tornado in Florida and brought heavy rains that already caused flooding and mudslides in Mexico and Central America. After weakening to a tropical depression while moving over land in Mexico's Gulf coast, Cristobal headed back into the southern Gulf of Mexico from the Yucatan Peninsula on Friday and powered back up into a tropical storm. Forecasters said it would arrive on U.S. soil late Sunday but was not expected to grow into a hurricane. Outer rain bands from the storm were spreading across parts of the northern Gulf Coast early Sunday, and conditions were expected to deteriorate, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. Cristobal’s maximum sustained winds remained at 50 mph and it was moving north at 12 mph, centered around 175 miles south-southwest from the mouth of the Mississippi River. On Sunday afternoon, the National Hurricane Center's Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch in Miami tweeted that the storm's ""peak seas"" off the coast of Louisiana were 25 feet tall, but that winds and seas would diminish on Monday. However, the National Hurricane Center said the storm was expected to slowly strengthen until making landfall Sunday night along the U.S. Gulf Coast. But the storm already made its presence felt Saturday evening with a tornado that touched down near downtown Orlando, the National Weather Service said. The twister just missed a group of protesters at Lake Eola at around 7:30 p.m. There appeared to be no injuries, but tree limbs were knocked down, and there were reports of power outages."
other,"Over recent months the sovereign debt and banking problems in Europe have again taken centre stage. These problems have led to high levels of volatility in financial markets and an increased focus on the downside risks to global growth. While the recent announcements by European leaders initially led to some improvement in confidence, difficult decisions still lie ahead, with many European governments facing a major challenge in putting their public finances on a sounder footing. The governments in the United States and Japan also face major medium-term fiscal challenges.These fiscal issues, together with the ongoing consolidation of private-sector balance sheets following the financial crisis, mean that the outlook for growth in many advanced economies remains subdued. Recent data in the United States, however, have been more positive than earlier in the year and are consistent with an economy that is experiencing a modest expansion, but with little inroad being made into the high level of unemployment. While the market turbulence has dented business and consumer confidence in the advanced economies, fears of a major downturn have not been borne out so far. At this stage, there are few signs of the widespread deferral of capital spending and disruptions to trade finance that caused so much damage to the world economy in 2008/09."
Typhoon,"Strong hurricanes could hit Asia and the U.S. East Coast more often this century, a new study finds.
The research adds to a growing body of evidence that hurricanes are becoming more intense as global warming heats the oceans. This means Category 1, 2 and 3 storms will have fiercer winds, bumping them up to Category 3, 4 and higher. Overall, the study's modeling approach predicts a 40 percent global increase in tropical cyclones of Category 3 and higher during the 21st century.
The findings were published in Monday's issue of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
The new study also projects that these strong storms will become more frequent in the North Pacific, the North Atlantic and the South Indian Oceans.
""We see an increase, in particular, toward the middle of the century,"" said Kerry Emanuel, study author and an MIT climatologist. ""The results surprised us, but we haven't gotten so far as to understand why this is happening.""
Scientists actively debate whether tropical cyclones (the broad name for hurricanes, typhoons and tropical storms) will become more frequent, more intense or both as a result of climate change. Global warming has heated the oceans along with the atmosphere, and sea-surface temperature is one of the most important influences on hurricane strength. But other factors — such as climate cycles, like the El Ni_o Southern Oscillation, and interactions with other storms, which can weaken or strengthen storms — also alter tropical storm strength. Hurricanes are also marvelous heat transporters, affecting climate by moving energy around the planet. [Hurricanes from Above: See Nature's Biggest Storms]
""For scientists, this is far from a solved problem,"" said Emanuel, who has been a main participant in the debates on the future of hurricanes. ""The main message is, we have to continue to regard there being a not-trivial risk of increasing problems from tropical cyclones because of climate change.""
How global warming fuels hurricanes
Hurricanes feed off warm ocean water. In the ocean's hurricane nurseries, heat rising from the ocean turns into water vapor. As the vapor rises and cools, it condenses into rain. This releases heat, which helps strengthen circulating tropical cyclones. Warmer oceans mean more water vapor, and more intense storms.
Emanuel relies on a technique called downscaling to estimate how future climate change will shift hurricane strength and frequency. In the new study, he used the latest global climate models, called CMIP5, which project future climate change but are too coarse to resolve ""small"" features, such as hurricanes. Emanuel ran the models at higher-resolution and randomly generated disturbances similar to tropical cyclones, and then used a theoretical model to predict how strong the storms would become. Emanuel first presented this approach, with an earlier version of the CMIP models (CMIP3), in a 2008 paper in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.
One limitation of relying on global climate models to predict future hurricanes is that these models do not capture the past decade's climate variability, such as relatively stable temperatures between 1998 and 2008, said Peter Webster, a climatologist at Georgia Tech who was not involved in the study. (The hiatus is attributed to natural variability in Earth's climate system, superimposed on the longer-term warming trend.)"
other,"Moreover, short sales serve a critical signaling role in markets and our economy, which is why efforts to restrict or even prohibit them are so dangerous. Contrarian short-sellers challenge conventional market wisdom, and thereby help identify potential bubbles, overpriced stocks, and wise investment opportunities. The stocks in question might be overpriced due to underlying improper internal business practices, as was the case with Enron, Tyco, and Worldcom. In other instances, the subject stocks might be overpriced due to looming technological innovations or market changes, and short selling signals approaching downturns like the 2008 housing market collapse to the rest of the world.  Nor is this a particularly American dynamic, as Britain¡¯s Financial News recently reported, ¡°Short-selling investors, including hedge funds, helped public pension funds and European regulators by exposing the massive accounting hole at high-flying fintech company Wirecard. Nearly $2 billion in cash is missing and no one knows where it is or if it ever actually existed. The firm¡¯s former CEO has been arrested and the full extent of the cover-up is to be determined. But for the important work of short-sellers, investors across Europe would have kept pouring cash into the firm.¡±Accordingly, short sales provide an invaluable market service by sending important signals to investors and consumers, thereby protecting investments and people¡¯s savings.  The effort to restrict or even prohibit short sales would inhibit American markets and investments at the worst possible time. What the American economy needs at this moment of sudden peril is more certainty and flexibility, not less."
drought,"From a dirt road overlooking the valley the landscape looks more like an abandoned quarry than what it is: the single source of sustenance for a community of thousands.
The parched, dusty hills are a patchwork of greys and browns. Farmers steer oxen-drawn ploughs through the small fields, their blades clinking each time they strike yet another stone.
Here in the Ingal mountains that straddle the border with Eritrea, the effects of Ethiopia’s worst drought in more than 30 years are written into the landscape.
The failure of both of the main rainy seasons last year had a devastating effect on an area where virtually every family lives off the land.
It has left almost every household dependent on food parcels from the Ethiopian government and, by prompting many young men to conclude they must leave, it has caused a surge in the number attempting long and dangerous journeys, primarily to Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Europe, in search of work.
Of 962 households in the village of Agere Lokema, 40km from Adigrat, 286 are headed by women.
“We women would migrate as well if we thought we could find work,” says Abeba Teklehaymanot, whose husband’s departure for the Middle East left her looking after their children and half hectare of land.
At night, when the children sleep and the temperature dips, Teklehaymanot joins teams of locals working to irrigate land – part of a project, co-run by Trócaire, aimed at diverting water for use by the community.
Further down the valley, the work is beginning to bear fruit: a series of stone and wire-mesh dams has trapped water and increased soil fertility, allowing livestock to feed and landless families to plant crops.
Recalling a sequence that began with the failure of the harvest and the gradual depletion of families’ food reserves, Teklehaymanot says it was the elderly who first felt the effects of the drought. Then she noticed the animals weaken."
Typhoon,"Typhoon Nuri weakened to a severe tropical storm as it landed in Hong Kong on Friday, bringing strong winds and rainfall but inflicting little damage.
No major destruction was reported, unlike in the Philippines, where Nuri killed seven people and triggered landslides and floods in the north.
But with Nuri landing in Hong Kong late Friday afternoon, the Hong Kong Observatory said it had weakened from a typhoon to a severe tropical storm. By late Friday night, the storm was headed northwest toward the southern Chinese city Guangzhou.
In Hong Kong, a man went missing while swimming off a local beach and 11 people were injured during the storm, with three in serious condition, the government said in a statement.
There also were reports of toppled trees, collapsed walls and scaffoldings.
The Hong Kong Observatory issued its second-highest tropical cyclone warning.
Flights, bus and ferry services were canceled, and offices, schools and financial markets were closed. At least 388 passenger flights were either canceled or delayed and another 15 diverted, the government said in a statement.

Fire officials said at an afternoon news briefing that wind was a big factor in fighting the blaze on Wednesday.
Colorado Springs Fire Chief Rich Brown said that on Wednesday, as was the case Tuesday, conditions are “erratic.”
He added: We “put out as many burning embers and hotspots as we can.”
Incident Commander Rich Harvey concurred. “I hate wind  Wind is big factor in how we do this fire. It won’t stay in the same place. The winds keep shifting on us.”
He said fire managers are expecting thunderstorms as a cold front moves in from Denver.
A lot of people expressed concern because Wednesday’s weather mirrors Tuesday’s. Harvey said everyone saw firsthand how quickly the fire can move.
“We’re learning its tricks,” Harvey said of the fire’s propensity to make quick runs.
The El Paso County Sheriff’s office announced about 1 p.m. that the pre-evacuation area had been expanded to Holland Park and Pleasant Valley. Minutes later the pre-evacuation notice was expanded to include the communities of Palmer Lake and Monument, north of the Air Force Academy to County Line Road and west of Interstate 25.
Fear of weather and wind changes caused a mandatory evacuation of about 3,000 people in Woodland Park and part of Teller County this morning.
A mandatory evacuation order was issued around 11:30 a.m. for areas east of Highway 24 to Baldwin Street, which turns into Rampart Range Road.
According to Woodland Park Mayor David Turley, the city is responding well and things are, for the most part, calm."

Flash floods triggered by heavy rains have washed away a remote mountain camp in Bhutan, killing at least 10 people and injuring five as floods in neighbouring Nepal left seven people missing.  The Bhutan villagers, who had been collecting cordeyceps, a fungus used in medicine, were sleeping when the floodwaters hit just after midnight. Their camp near Laya, about 60 km north of the capital Thimphu, was washed away, local media reported.

other,"Fiscal policy involves the use of government spending and revenue raising (taxation) to impact a number of aspects of the economy: the overall level of aggregate demand in an economy and hence the level of economic activity; the distribution of income and wealth among different segments of the population; and hence ultimately the allocation of resources between different sectors and economic agents.The tools that governments use in implementing fiscal policy are related to the way in which they raise revenue and the different forms of expenditure. Governments usually raise money via a combination of direct and indirect taxes. Government expenditure can be current on goods and services or can take the form of capital expenditure, for example, on infrastructure projects.As economic growth weakens, or when it is in recession, a government can enact an expansionary fiscal policy¡ªfor example, by raising expenditure without an offsetting increase in taxation. Conversely, by reducing expenditure and maintaining tax revenues, a contractionary policy might reduce economic activity. Fiscal policy can therefore play an important role in stabilizing an economy.Although both fiscal and monetary policy can alter aggregate demand, they work through different channels, the policies are therefore not interchangeable, and they conceivably can work against one another unless the government and central bank coordinate their objectives.

Greece and western Turkey sit above a complicated convergence of chunks of Earth’s crust called tectonic plates. Four plates meet under the Aegean Sea, putting immense pressure on the plate directly below Turkey, Maya Wei-Haas reports for National Geographic. That makes the region one of the most geologically active in the world. It’s seen at least 29 earthquakes with magnitudes above 6.0 in the last century, Jariel Arvin reports for Vox. Last week’s earthquake has caused more than 900 aftershocks, 42 of which had a magnitude above 4.0, Isil Jariyuce and Maija Ehlinger report for CNN."
other,"Going forward, the domestic economy will be entering a period of more moderate and sustainable pace of expansion.  CPI inflation will remain largely contained for 2005 as a whole, although some upward pressures on consumer prices are expected.  Against this backdrop, MAS will be maintaining its policy of a modest and gradual appreciation of the S$NEER.  There will be no change in the slope or the width of the policy band.  This policy stance will remain supportive of economic growth, while ensuring low and stable inflation over the medium term."
other,"The U.S. economy posted significant further gains in the first half of 1998. The unemployment rate dropped to its lowest level in nearly thirty years, and inflation remained subdued. Real output rose appreciably, on balance, although much of the advance apparently occurred early in the year. Household spending and business fixed investment, supported by the ongoing rise in equity prices and the continued low level of long-term interest rates, appear to have maintained considerable momentum this year. The sizable advance in capital spending and the resulting additions to the capital stock should help bolster labor productivity--the key to rising living standards."
valcano eruption,"UN to launch funding appeal for Saint Vincent and the Grenadines following volcano eruption The UN is set to launch a funding appeal to support Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, where ongoing volcanic “explosions” continue to disrupt life in the Caribbean island nation and nearby countries, a top official in the region said on Wednesday. Didier Trebucq, UN Resident Coordinator for Barbados and the Caribbean, briefed journalists on response to the growing humanitarian crisis sparked after long-dormant La Soufrière volcano erupted last week, displacing some 20,000 people, or roughly one-fifth of the population. Around 6,000 are considered vulnerable. “We are about to initiate the UN funding appeal and response plan to support the humanitarian response, but also the early recovery for the next six months”, he said, speaking via video link from Barbados. “This is a crisis that is going to last certainly more than six months in the sub-region, in Saint Vincent, and other islands.”"
drought,"Born into a farming family in south Yunnan province, China, Zhu Youyong's life has always been tied to the soil. At the age of 54, however, Zhu — now president of Yunnan Agricultural University in Kunming — says he ""has never seen such severe drought in Yunnan"".
Since last September, the province has had 60% less rainfall than normal. According to the Ministry of Civil Affairs, 8.1 million people — 18% of Yunnan's population — are short of drinking water, and US2.5-billion worth of crops are expected to fail.
Scientists in China say that the crisis marks one of the strongest case studies so far of how climate change and poor environmental practice can combine to create a disaster. They are now scrambling to pin down exactly what caused the drought, and whether similar events are likely to hit the region more often in the future.
Meanwhile, with most of the province's winter crops ruined, local farmers need immediate help. Zhu has been going from county to county to persuade farmers to grow different crops together in the same field, rather than as a monoculture. Intercropping can boost yields by up to 30%, and could help to avoid food shortages in the region later this year1. This summer, 80% of the farmland in Yunnan — a staggering 2.9 million hectares — will use the technique. But success will depend on a break in the weather. ""If it still doesn't rain in late May, the consequences will be unthinkable,"" says Zhu."

drought,"More than 90% of the U.S. West is in drought for the first time in the history of Drought Monitor. The news comes as the region is prepping for an exceptionally dangerous and historic heat wave this weekend. The temperatures are expected to reach unprecedented levels in many areas and remain high for a prolonged period -- prepare for it, don't get caught off guard.
""The drought situation in the western United States continued to worsen after another mostly hot and dry week,"" Curtis Riganti of the National Drought Mitigation Center and Ahira Sanches-Lugo of NOAA/NCEI noted in the National Drought Summary issued June 22, 2021.
A few areas of drought in south-central and southeast New Mexico saw some slight improvement due to effects from several rain and thunderstorm events in the last month.
Unfortunately, widespread severe or worse drought continued in New Mexico, and conditions remained the same or worsened elsewhere. 
Increases in moderate, severe, extreme (and in a few cases, exceptional) drought coverage occurred in Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, and Montana. Severe drought also expanded in western Idaho. 
While wildfires and increasing wildfire danger, water restrictions, and damage to agriculture are very common across the West region, this is the first time since the inception of Drought Monitor in 1999, more than 90% percent of the region is in drought -- 97.89%."
other,"For now, the US Federal Reserve has the most flexible toolkit among the major central banks. In addition to inflationary pressure, the Fed¡¯s monetary policy must also take into account employment statistics, growth data, and the stability of financial markets. But even the Fed¡¯s flexibility is under siege. Republican lawmakers are discussing how to bind the Fed to more scripted policy rules to manage inflation (using a formula known as the Taylor rule, which predetermines changes in the federal funds rate in relation to inflation and an output gap). Needless to say, such a move would be a mistake.Central banks (not to mention lawmakers), with their strong attachment to neo-Keynesian theory, are ignoring a major lesson from decades of monetary-policy experimentation: the impact of monetary policy cannot be predicted with a high degree of certainty or accuracy. But the belief that it can is essential to the credibility of the now-standard inflation targets. If central banks keep missing these rather narrow marks (¡°below, but close to 2%¡±), they end up in an expectations trap, whereby markets expect them to dispense ever higher doses of monetary medicine in a frantic attempt to reach their target.Clearly, such monetary policies create soaring costs and risks for the economy. And central banks themselves are coming dangerously close to looking like fiscal agents, which could undermine their legitimacy."

More than 200mm of rain falling in less than 12 hours. Roads were inundated with flood water up to 50cm deep, causing widespread traffic disruption. Train services were also interrupted.  India Meteorological Department (IMD) said Mumbai and neighbouring Thane, Palghar and Raigad districts will receive heavy to very heavy rainfall over the coming 3 or 4 days. Fifteen National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams have been deployed to various parts of Maharashtra state in response.  The government of Mumbai, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), reported a building collapsed in Malvani, Malad West. At least 11 people have died in the incident, with 17 injured and 15 rescued. More are feared buried in the rubble and firefighters are conducting rescue operations. Three other buildings nearby are in “dangerous condition” and the residents have been evacuated, the BMC said.  Although the cause of the collapse is not clear, some speculated the building it was the result of heavy rainfall as with other similar tragedies in the past. Over 20 people died in Malad East, Mumbai, when a wall collapsed destroying several makeshift homes during heavy rainfall in July 2019."
other,"A major factor in a nation's economy is its monetary policy, which determines the amount of money flowing through the economy.Set by the Federal Reserve in the United States, monetary policy influences economic activity by controlling the country's money supply and credit. The U.S. Federal Reserve can control monetary policy by altering rates of interest and changing the amount of money banks must have in their reserves. The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 officially gave the Federal Reserve power over the country's monetary policy. Since then, the importance of monetary policy has increased tremendously.When implemented correctly, monetary policy stabilizes prices and wages, which leads to an increase in jobs and long-term economic growth. U.S. monetary policy plays a significant role in not just the economy as a whole but also specific decisions consumers make, such as buying a home or a car, starting or expanding a business, and investing money.The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) determine monetary policy. The key to monetary policy is finding the perfect balance; letting the money supply grow too rapidly increases inflation, and allowing it to grow too slowly stunts economic growth."
Typhoon,"A powerful typhoon was ripping through Japan on Sunday and authorities were warning people to brace for heavy winds and rain in areas that include those devastated by a previous storm.
Many flights were canceled at major airports throughout Japan, including Tokyo’s Narita and Haneda, as Typhoon Trami approached. The storm destroyed power lines on the southwestern islands of Okinawa on Saturday.
In its projected course are regions hit earlier this month by Typhoon Jebi, which caused landslides, floods and shuttered a major airport. The strongest typhoon to hit Japan in 25 years, Jebi caused 11 deaths in and around Osaka.
Trami was expected to hit Tokyo late Sunday, and slam northern Japan on Monday.
In July, heavy rain in western Japan killed 221 people, setting off landslides and flooding."
drought,"In the cattle town of Emory in East Texas, the worst drought in state history is threatening a way of life. Scorching temperatures and a lack of rain have forced many ranchers to sell off their stock.
Normally before being brought to market, cattle are penned in a rancher's best pasture to be fattened. The heavier the cow, the more the buyer pays.
But the animals at a recent Emory auction look pitiful. They're standing in 107-degree heat — that's in the shade — with their ribs showing, stressed out. It's been like this for the past nine weeks — no rain. Although these cows were bred for the heat, they weren't bred for this. They look absolutely baked.
If this were a normal year, an August cattle auction in Emory would see maybe 100 to 200 head. There are more than 700 head today. And that's down from the more than 1,000 head sold here every Tuesday for much of this summer. The sad truth is, East Texas is starting to run out of stock to sell.
Inside the auction room, buyers in jeans and cowboy hats, here from Michigan and Wisconsin, Tennessee and Alabama, raise their fingers in front of their chests to bid. One cow, one calf, one bull after another, until late into the night. The Lone Star State is emptying itself of its cattle.
Stanley Austin is a rancher and a commission-order buyer, which means he buys livestock for farmers and feed yards. He has seen the drought's effects up close, at his family's ranch.
""We've had that place in our family for 75 years,"" he says, ""and it's never been without water. It's been without water now since about the 15th of June.""
Austin travels throughout Texas, going to seven livestock sales each week. He says the drought is going to alter the state's rural economies forever."
other,"The impressive performance of the U.S. economy persisted in the first half of 2000 with economic activity expanding at a rapid pace. Overall rates of inflation were noticeably higher, largely as a result of steep increases in energy prices. The remarkable wave of new technologies and the associated surge in capital investment have continued to boost potential supply and to help contain price pressures at high levels of labor resource use. At the same time, rising productivity growth--working through its effects on wealth and consumption, as well as on investment spending--has been one of the important factors contributing to rapid increases in aggregate demand that have exceeded even the stepped-up increases in potential supply. Under such circumstances, and with the pool of available labor already at an unusually low level, the continued expansion of aggregate demand in excess of the growth in potential supply increasingly threatened to set off greater price pressures. Because price stability is essential to achieving maximum sustainable economic growth, heading off these pressures has been critical to extending the extraordinary performance of the U.S. economy."
Typhoon,"Tropical storm Fay insured loss estimated at $400m by KCC Recent tropical storm Fay, which took the record as the earliest F named storm in history as it targeted the U.S. northeast region, is estimated to have caused an insurance market loss of roughly $400 million by catastrophe risk modeller Karen Clark & Company (KCC). Tropical storm Fay formed off the North Carolina coast on July 9th and headed north, with the storm gaining structure and wind speed strength to become a strong tropical storm with sustained winds of around 60mph before it headed for a landfall in the northeast U.S. on July 10th. Tropical storm Fay made landfall just north of Atlantic City, New Jersey, and continued north through New York, with its sustained winds weakening as it passed through this area of particularly high insurance and reinsurance market exposure. KCC explained that parts of Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York all saw damaging winds from tropical storm Fay. Some power outages were reported in New York and New Jersey, although these were largely quickly resolved. The most likely impacts from tropical storm Fay are light wind damage, but some structural damage is possible from trees falling on buildings, KCC said. The catastrophe risk modeller highlighted that in New York City alone hundreds of downed trees were reported, while parts of New Jersey and Pennsylvania, among other areas, also experienced tree damage that resulted in infrastructure disruption. Low levels of storm surge were also seen along a swathe of the U.S. eastern seaboard from South Carolina to New York. Having run its catastrophe risk model, KCC believes that tropical storm Fay will result in an estimated close to $400 million of losses that fall to the insurance market. At that low-level losses to reinsurance capital would be expected to be minimal. KCC said its estimate includes privately insured wind and storm surge damage to residential, commercial and industrial properties, as well as automobiles. But it does not include any NFIP losses."
earthquake,"A 6.2-magnitude earthquake off the coast of southern Africa had some Cape Town residents worried on Saturday night.
The quake, which occurred 1918km SSE of Cape Town, hit at around 5.10 pm, according to the US Geological Survey.
With its epicentre at a depth of 10 kilometres, there were no tsunami warnings or reports of damage.
The Koeberg nuclear power plant outside Cape Town and Astron Energy, which owns Caltex, have assured locals that there was no immediate danger and no need to evacuate.
The City of Cape Town has confirmed that they have received reports of tremors but are still awaiting official confirmation.
“Reports have come from numerous suburbs of a tremor that was experienced,” said Charlotte Powell, the head of Public Awareness and Preparedness.
“The Disaster Risk Management Centre is not in a position to provide comment on the apparent seismic event until it has been confirmed by the South African Council for Geoscience.
“We can however confirm at this stage that the tremor did not appear to cause any impact on infrastructure of public safety.
“The City urges the public to report any potential impacts to our Public Emergency Communication Centre by dialing 021 480 7700 from a cellphone or 107 from a landline,” she said.
Several Capetonians reported feeling tremors up to two hours after the seismic event and many of them took to social media to share their experience.
Among them were Good Things Guy's Brent Lindeque, who confirmed the quake on Twitter."
other,"Inflation prospects are important, not just because price stability is in itself desirable and part of the Federal Reserve's mandate from the Congress, but also because price stability is essential for strong and stable growth of output and employment. Stable prices promote long-term economic growth by allowing households and firms to make economic decisions and undertake productive activities with fewer concerns about large or unanticipated changes in the price level and their attendant financial consequences. Experience shows that low and stable inflation and inflation expectations are also associated with greater short-term stability in output and employment, perhaps in part because they give the central bank greater latitude to counter transitory disturbances to the economy. Similarly, the attainment of the statutory goal of moderate long-term interest rates requires price stability, because only then are the inflation premiums that investors demand for holding long-term instruments kept to a minimum. In sum, achieving price stability is not only important in itself; it is also central to attaining the Federal Reserve's other mandated objectives of maximum sustainable employment and moderate long-term interest rates.As always, however, translating the Federal Reserve's general economic objectives into operational decisions about the stance of monetary policy poses many challenges. Over the past few decades, policymakers have learned that no single economic or financial indicator, or even a small set of such indicators, can provide reliable guidance for the setting of monetary policy.Rather, the Federal Reserve, together with all modern central banks, has found that the successful conduct of monetary policy requires painstaking examination of a broad range of economic and financial data, careful consideration of the implications of those data for the likely path of the economy and inflation, and prudent judgment regarding the effects of alternative courses of policy action on prospects for achieving our macroeconomic objectives. In that process, economic models can provide valuable guidance to policymakers, and over the years substantial progress has been made in developing formal models and forecasting techniques. But any model is by necessity a simplification of the real world, and sufficient data are seldom available to measure even the basic relationships with precision. Monetary policymakers must therefore strike a difficult balance--conducting rigorous analysis informed by sound economic theory and empirical methods while keeping an open mind about the many factors, including myriad global influences, at play in a dynamic modern economy like that of the United States. Amid significant uncertainty, we must formulate a view of the most likely course of the economy under a given policy approach while giving due weight to the potential risks and associated costs to the economy should those judgments turn out to be wrong.

Typhoon,"Hurricane Sally made landfall near Gulf Shores, Alabama in the early hours of Wednesday morning as a Category 2, bringing a storm surge and more than 2 feet (60cm) of rain.
The northern eyewall brought hurricane-strength winds across the Gulf coast from Pensacola Beach in Florida through to Dauphin Island, Alabama.
Almost 650,000 customers are without power across three states.
The slow speed of the system, moving at just 3mph, and the amount of rain falling, could seriously exacerbate flooding, which is already widespread across the region. A flash flood emergency remains in place until 5.30pm CDT and people are advised to not travel unless fleeing an area subject to flooding.
Pensacola, Florida, currently has between three and four feet of water in its streets and more rainfall is expected. Much of downtown is impassable, and part of the brand-new Three Mile Bridge to the city of Gulf Breeze is now ""missing,"" according to the National Weather Service (NWS) forecast office in Mobile. A barge has reportedly also struck the bridge.
FEMA has pre-positioned more than 1.8 million meals and 1.5 million bottles of water in response to the hurricane. 
It is the eighth named storm to reach landfall on American shores this year, reportedly breaking a 104-year old record last set when seven storms landed in 1916’s storm season."
drought,"A series of potent winter storms that lashed Northern, and more recently Southern California, has erased the worst of the long-term drought that plagued the Golden State for three years.
For the first time in 36 months, the US Drought Monitor report issued Thursday does not show any part of California in deep red, which denotes its highest designation, ""Exceptional Drought.”
At its height, the Exceptional Drought area covered nearly 2/3 of the state and as recently as Christmas of 2016, approximately 20% of the state was still in the worst of the drought.
It's not just the worst drought areas that have improved. Now, 38% of California is completely clear of any dryness, according to the Drought Monitor, the most drought-free area since December of 2011.
While the record El Niño of 2015/16 failed to live up to expectations when it came to putting a dent in the mult-year drought, a series of moisture-rich storms fueled by ""atmospheric rivers"" so far this winter has done the job."
valcano eruption,"Eritrea volcano ash hits Ethiopia villagers Ash spewing from the Nabro volcano in Eritrea has covered villages in Ethiopia, affecting at least 5,000 people, aid workers say. Initial reports said eight villages in the Biddu district of Ethiopia, close to the border, were covered by volcanic dust. Villagers have been left without food and traditional springs and streams have been polluted. The Afar regional government says the numbers affected could rise sharply. Save the Children told the BBC the authorities had sent a team to conduct a detailed assessment of the situation. An initial report by the regional government says the situation in border villages is a serious concern. ""Many community members and especially children are reported sick and in desperate need of medical attention,"" said Teshome Assefa, of Save the Children. ""Vomiting and retching are common."" The whereabouts of one community living close to the eruption is unknown. The Nabro volcano has sent the plumes of ash 13km (eight miles) into the air."
Typhoon,"Tropical Storm Chan-hom brought powerful winds and rain to southern Japan on Saturday, with the weather bureau warning of landslides and flooding in most of the country.
The storm, packing sustained winds of up to 107 kilometers (67 miles) per hour, was moving in waters south of Japan, near the main southwestern island of Shikoku.
It had been downgraded from a typhoon earlier in the week. It was expected to hover eastward, affecting Honshu as well as smaller islands such as Izu by early Sunday.
The storm was not expected to seriously affect Tokyo or make direct landfall.
Weather forecasts warned of a heavy downpour and fierce winds, which may cause rivers to swell and towering waves in coastal areas as well as mudslides."
valcano eruption,"Death Toll from Japan Volcano Rises to 47 October 01, 2014 04:59 AM Volcanic smoke rise from Mt. Ontake, which straddles Nagano and Gifu prefectures, central Japan, September 30, 2014. Authorities in central Japan say 47 people are now confirmed to have died from the deadliest volcanic eruption in post-war Japan. Police earlier said the number of dead was 48, but later corrected the figure. Authorities in Nagano prefecture believe all of the known victims have been recovered after the surprise eruption of Mount Ontake, which occurred Saturday. Most of the bodies of hikers have been found near the summit where a shrine attracts visitors. The remains of others were discovered at a slightly lower elevation where there is little place to hide. Hundreds of survivors were trapped on the mountain until Saturday evening, many of them having suffered serious cuts, bruises and bone fractures."
drought,"The number of people facing severe food shortages is set to increase as the impact of drought, along with high food and fuel prices, continues to grip the Horn of Africa region, FAO warned today.
High levels of acute malnutrition are widespread and more than 8 million people in Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia are in need of emergency assistance.
The region has now experienced two consecutive seasons of significantly below-average rainfall, resulting in failed crop production, depletion of grazing resources and significant livestock mortality.
Chronic crisis
""The current crisis is not an unusual or chance event, but rather a chronic feature of the region. The challenge ahead is to empower farmers and pastoralists to adapt to the new realities of high variability of weather patterns and more frequent extreme weather events,"" said Rod Charters, Regional Emergency Coordinator for Eastern and Central Africa.
""Together with our partners of the Regional Food Security and Nutrition Working Group we have been preparing for this drought scenario since the failure of last year's short rains. FAO issued various alerts and has been supporting countries' preparedness plans in the Region.""
In Somalia, malnutrition rates are amongst the worst in the world, with one in four children in southern Somalia acutely malnourished. The drought is affecting most parts of the country, leading to livestock deaths and sky-rocketing food prices which make it increasingly difficult for poor families to feed themselves.
Currently, 2.5 million people _ one in three Somalis _ are in need of humanitarian assistance but with the ongoing conflict in the South, coupled with the poor outlook for the upcoming harvest, many more Somalis may fall into severe crisis.
In Kenya, more than 2.4 million people in the pastoralist and agropastoralist areas of northern and northeastern regions are estimated to be unable to meet their basic food and water needs. The food security situation is expected to further deteriorate as milk production in the drought-affected areas has collapsed and will not recover until October when the short rains are expected to start.
Furthermore, distances to water have doubled to 30-40 kms in many areas and conflicts have occurred over grazing resources, leading to loss of human lives and livestock, along with constrained market access. Emergency interventions are urgently required to mitigate the impact and protect further livelihood and nutritional deterioration.
In Ethiopia, a La Ni?a episode has resulted in the failure of two consecutive seasons of rain, water shortages, very poor pasture and marked deterioration in livestock conditions resulting in much reduced livestock prices in south and southeastern lowlands. In Borena Zone, on the southern border with Kenya, 220 000 cattle deaths have been reported. 
Additionally, the drought has also affected the 2011 ""belg"" cropping season to be harvested in June/July, which is expected to be very poor in the Oromia, Tigray, Ahmara and SNNP (Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples) regions.
At the beginning of June the number of people requiring assistance in Ethiopia was estimated at 11.4 million.  This includes 3.2 million people in need of emergency assistance and the 8.2 million people registered under the productive safety net programme.
In Djibouti, the ongoing drought coupled with very high staple food prices, high unemployment and increased rural-urban migration has worsened the food security situation at the household level. Water shortages in Djibouti City are also expected to become a serious issue over the coming months as the peak demand for water approaches."
wildfires,"Smoke particles from the fires ravaging Australia have traveled more than 12,000 km, crossed an ocean and a mountain range and arrived in South America, meteorological institutions confirmed, after smoke was detected in Chile, Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay.
“From the afternoon of 6 January, a grey cloud and redder sunrises and sunsets could be seen in the sky [in Uruguay] due to the presence of small particles in suspension, more than 6,000 meters high, of smoke generated by the great fires in Australia,” said a statement from the Uruguayan Institute of Meteorology (Inumet).
Lucia Chiponelli, technical manager at Inumet, told SciDev.Net that despite the annual “bushfire season” in Australia, this was the first time smoke had been recorded arriving in Latin America in recent decades.
Fires raging in Australia since September have killed 24 people, destroyed more than 1,500 homes, and razed 6 million hectares of land, leaving more than 500 million animals dead. The bushfires, which are among the worst in the country’s history, have been fuelled by record temperatures — 41.9 °C on 17 December — and several months of intense droughts.
It comes after record fires in the Brazilian Amazon last year burned around 1 million hectares of forest between July and September, according to official statistics, while environmental organisations put the figure at more than double that.
NASA video shows the movement towards South America of a huge cloud of smoke from the Australian fires.
One of the consequences of such fires is that when air is heated it rises to the upper layers of the atmosphere, dragging particles from the burned materials along with carbon monoxide and other compounds derived from combustion.
This hot air reaches a height of up to 6,000 meters and from there joins the air currents of the Southern Hemisphere, Chiponelli explained. Smoke from Australia entered Latin America through Chile “because air circulation [in the Southern Hemisphere] always goes from west to east,” Soledad Osores, of the National Meteorological Service of Argentina, told SciDev.Net."

other,"President Joe Biden vowed Thursday to retaliate for a terrorist attack that killed 13 US service members outside Kabul's international airport even as he said the frantic mission to airlift Americans from Afghanistan would continue.
""We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay,"" Biden said in early evening remarks from the White House, hours after the Pentagon said 12 service members had been killed in two separate suicide blasts outside the airport gates. Shortly after Biden spoke, US Central Command announced an additional US service member has died, with a total of 18 wounded. Ten Marines were among the 13 service members killed.
In a subdued but firm tone, Biden said he's asked the US military for options to respond to the explosions, which he said had been carried out by the Islamic State affiliate operating in Afghanistan.
""We will respond with force and precision at our time, at the place we choose and the moment of our choosing,"" Biden said. ""Here's what you need to know: These ISIS terrorists will not win.""
The terror attacks, which came after days of public and private warnings from Biden of a potential threat that could disrupt the massive airlift effort, have complicated the bloody final days of America's longest war. It made for what Biden's aides described as the worst day of his young presidency.
Now, in addition to evacuating thousands of people who desperately want to leave Afghanistan, Biden has tasked the military with another mission: hunting down and punishing the ISIS terrorists who killed Americans and scores of Afghan civilians."
other,"The U.S. economy has weakened considerably since last July, when the Federal Reserve Board submitted its previous Monetary Policy Report to the Congress. Substantial strains have emerged in financial markets here and abroad, and housing-related activity has continued to contract. Also, further increases in the prices of crude oil and some other commodities have eroded the real incomes of U.S. households and added to business costs. Overall economic activity held up reasonably well into the autumn despite these adverse developments, but it decelerated sharply in the fourth quarter. Moreover, the outlook for 2008 has become less favorable since last summer, and considerable downside risks to economic activity have emerged. Headline consumer price inflation picked up in 2007 as a result of sizable increases in energy and food prices, while core inflation (which excludes the direct effects of movements in energy and food prices) was, on balance, a little lower than in 2006. Nonetheless, with inflation expectations anticipated to remain reasonably well anchored, energy and other commodity prices expected to flatten out, and pressures on resources likely to ease, monetary policy makers generally have expected inflation to moderate somewhat in 2008 and 2009. Under these circumstances, the Federal Reserve has eased the stance of monetary policy substantially since July."
Typhoon,"Edouard _ Atlantic Ocean July 07, 2020 _ Edouard Now Post-Tropical in NASA-NOAA Satellite Imagery When NASA-NOAA’s Suomi NPP satellite passed over the western North Atlantic Ocean on July 6, it provided forecasters with a visible image of Edouard after it transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) defines a post-tropical cyclone as a former tropical cyclone. This generic term describes a cyclone that no longer possesses sufficient tropical characteristics to be considered a tropical cyclone. Post-tropical cyclones can continue carrying heavy rains and high winds. Two classes of post-tropical cyclones include extratropical and remnant lows. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument aboard Suomi NPP provided a visible image that showed Edouard’s center of circulation has merged with a frontal boundary. Therefore, the system was classified as extratropical."
other,"The global economy grew at an above-trend pace in 2010 and a continuation of strong growth is expected over the next couple of years, albeit with some moderation in the pace. There are, however, large differences in the amount of spare capacity across economies. In many advanced economies, output remains around, or below, pre-crisis levels and unemployment rates are still very high. In contrast, most emerging market economies have experienced very strong recoveries and spare capacity is limited.In Asia, growth looks to have picked up again recently, after softening in the middle of 2010. The Chinese economy is growing strongly and this is benefiting other economies in the region, with international trade and industrial production recording significant increases in the final months of 2010. Across the region, inflation rates have picked up, with food prices in particular rising strongly. In response, policy interest rates have been increased in most countries, although real interest rates generally remain quite low. Authorities have also taken measures to slow credit growth and short-term capital inflows, which are putting upward pressure on exchange rates."
drought,"The city is implementing Level 4 water restrictions, which ask residents to limit daily usage to 100 liters (26 gallons) per person. The measure is meant to reduce demand and conserve what little water is still available, and means significant sacrifices for residents.
For Cape Town resident Suzanne Buckley, the restrictions mean adapting to a new lifestyle.
""We have buckets in our shower and bathroom sink to save excess water,"" Buckley said. ""The gray water is then used to flush our toilets.”、The restrictions are in effect across the city in an aggressive effort to preserve its remaining drinking water, but it may not be enough.
South Africa ranks as the 30th driest country in the world and is considered a water-scarce region. A highly variable climate causes uneven distribution of rainfall, making droughts even more extreme.
Speaking to CNN, Cape Town Executive Mayor Patricia de Lille explained her concerns about the growing water crisis.
""Climate change is a reality and we cannot depend on rainwater alone to fill our dams, but must look at alternative sources like desalination and underground aquifers.""
The Western Cape, one of the country's nine provinces and home to Cape Town, experiences its annual rainy season during the winter months (June-September). Capetonians are likely several weeks away from any substantial, drought-relieving rainfall.
Even then, predictions are dire for this winter as a potential El Niño develops off the west coast of South America, according to the Climate Prediction Center. If El Niño does materialize, it would have a negative effect on rainfall across the Western Cape."
drought,"Food shortage fears over a drought in southern Africa have prompted Malawi to declare a state of national disaster and Mozambique to issue a ""red alert"".
The President of Malawi, Peter Mutharika, warned in a statement some people needed aid for all of this year.
Mozambique raised alert levels for southern and central regions.
Zimbabwe, Lesotho and Zambia are also suffering food shortages, while South Africa says its drought is the worst in a century.
Over 10 million people across the region will need food aid in the coming year, according to the World Food Programme (WFP).
Malawi has suffered both flash floods and drought recently, hitting the staple maize crop.
""It is very clear that we have a food shortage in the country which will affect a considerable number of our fellow citizens,"" Mr Mutharika said."
wildfires,"More than 50 homes were damaged or destroyed and 13 firefighters were injured overnight by catastrophic wildfires across Australia's most populous state before the emergency subsided on Wednesday, officials said.
At point on Tuesday, 16 fires raged out of control at emergency level simultaneously across New South Wales, a near record number.
There were no fires burning at emergency level early Wednesday, but rain that would quench the fire danger is not forecast for months. Friday experienced similarly intense fires which killed three residents and destroyed more than 150 homes.
State Premier Gladys Berejiklian said she was relieved that the destruction on Tuesday had not been worse. A weeklong state of emergency for New South Wales was declared on Monday because of the fire danger, with Tuesday forecast to be the most dangerous day.
""I have to confess to being hugely relieved this morning that yesterday our amazing volunteers and emergency service personnel withstood the catastrophic conditions and did manage to save life and property,"" Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney.
Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said none of the injured firefighters had been seriously hurt."
other,"The labor market improved further during the second half of 2013 and into early 2014 as the economic recovery strengthened: Employment has increased at an average monthly pace of about 175,000 since June, and the unemployment rate fell from 7.5 percent in June to 6.6 percent in January. With these gains, payrolls have risen a cumulative 3-1/4 million and the unemployment rate has declined 1-1/2 percentage points since August 2012, the month before the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) began its current asset purchase program. Nevertheless, even with these improvements, the unemployment rate remains well above levels that FOMC participants judge to be sustainable in the longer run."
other,"In the second half of 2013, growth in Australia's major trading partners looks to have continued at close to the average pace of the past decade. Economic growth in China remained a little above the government's target of 7.5 per cent for 2013, supported by consumption and investment. In Japan, economic conditions showed further improvement towards the end of last year, consistent with expansionary fiscal and monetary policy and the associated depreciation of the yen. In the rest of east Asia, growth over recent quarters appears to have been close to its average of the past decade and was broad based across consumption, investment and exports. There are signs that economic growth in India has improved somewhat, and inflation has eased a little but remains high. The recovery in the US economy strengthened through the second half of 2013, driven by private demand, and the labour market continued to improve. The recent agreement on the budget implies a smaller contraction in public demand than was scheduled to occur. In the euro area, there are tentative signs of a gradual recovery. Inflation in the major economies remains low, although it has increased in Japan."
other,"On September 1, 2020, the Reserve Bank increased the limits under Held to Maturity (HTM) category from 19.5 per cent to 22 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) in respect of statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) eligible securities acquired on or after September 1, 2020, up to March 31, 2021. This dispensation was made available up to March 31, 2022. In order to provide certainty to the market participants in the context of the borrowing programme of the centre and states for 2021-22, it has now been decided to extend the dispensation of enhanced HTM of 22 per cent up to March 31, 2023 to include securities acquired between April 1, 2021 and March 31, 2022. The HTM limits would be restored from 22 per cent to 19.5 per cent in a phased manner starting from the quarter ending June 30, 2023. It is expected that banks will be able to plan their investments in SLR securities in an optimal manner with a clear glide path for restoration of HTM limits.In order to incentivise new credit flow to the micro, small, and medium enterprise (MSME) borrowers, Scheduled Commercial Banks will be allowed to deduct credit disbursed to ¡®New MSME borrowers¡¯ from their Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL) for calculation of the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR). For the purpose of this exemption, ¡¯New MSME borrowers¡¯ shall be defined as those MSME borrowers who have not availed any credit facilities from the banking system as on January 1, 2021. This exemption will be available only for exposures up to _25 lakh per borrower for credit extended up to the fortnight ending October 1, 2021 for a period of one year from the date of origination of the loan or the tenure of the loan, whichever is earlier.As part of the regulatory measures taken in the wake of COVID-19, the implementation of last tranche of the capital conservation buffer (CCB) of 0.625 per cent, which was scheduled to take effect from April 1, 2020, was deferred till April 1, 2021. Considering the continuing stress on account of COVID-19, and in order to aid in the recovery process, it has been decided to defer the implementation of the last tranche of the CCB of 0.625 per cent from April 1, 2021 to October 1, 2021.As part of the regulatory measures taken in the wake of COVID-19, the implementation of Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) by banks in India had been deferred to April 1, 2021. While banks are comfortably placed on the liquidity front, in view of the continued stress on account of COVID-19, it has been decided to defer the implementation of NSFR to October 1, 2021.Recently, the Reserve Bank has released a discussion paper on Revised Regulatory Framework for NBFCs _ A Scale Based Approach. Taking into consideration the constantly evolving milieu in the financial sector, it is proposed to review the regulatory framework for Non-Banking Financial Company - Micro Finance Institutions (NBFC-MFIs). There is a case for having a framework which is uniformly applicable to all regulated lenders in the microfinance space including scheduled commercial banks, small finance banks and NBFC-Investment and Credit Companies, rather than prescribing these guidelines for NBFC-MFIs alone. Accordingly, the RBI will come out with a consultative document harmonising the regulatory frameworks for various regulated lenders in the microfinance space in March 2021.Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks are an important segment of the credit structure. The provisions of the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Act, 2020 are applicable to Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks (UCBs) with effect from June 26, 2020. The amendments have brought near parity in regulatory and supervisory powers between UCBs and commercial banks in respect of regulatory powers including those related to governance, audit and resolution. Consequently, a comprehensive review of regulatory/supervisory approach towards the sector is required in the light of these amendments. Accordingly, it has been decided to set up an Expert Committee on UCBs involving all stakeholders in order to provide a medium-term road map to strengthen the sector, enable faster rehabilitation/resolution of UCBs, as well as to examine other critical aspects relating to these entities. The constitution of the Committee as well as the terms of reference will be notified separately.At present, resident individuals are not allowed to make remittances to IFSCs established in India under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS). In order to deepen the financial markets in IFSCs and provide an opportunity to resident individuals to diversify their portfolio, on a review, it has been decided to permit resident individuals to make remittances to IFSCs established in India under the Scheme. Since remittances towards current account transactions like travel, education, gifts and capital account transactions like purchase of immovable property are not relevant with respect to IFSCs in India, remittances will be permitted only for making investments in securities issued by the non-resident entities in IFSCs. Resident Individuals may also open a non-interest bearing Foreign Currency Account (FCA) in IFSCs for making investments under LRS. The funds in the FCA shall be used only for the purpose of making permissible investments in IFSC and any funds lying idle in the account shall be repatriated to resident account of the investor in India within a period of 15 days from receipt. Detailed guidelines in the form of an AP DIR Circular shall be issued shortly."
drought,"An 81-year-old woman and her 93-year-old husband they are heartbroken after watching a coyote snatch their 16-year-old cat, and drag it into the woods.
Loretta Scanlon told FOX25 she chased after the coyote in attempt to rescue the pet.
“You know, I was a nurse for years and I've seen a lot of horrible things in the OR... but this is... this is something different. You know, this is horrible,” she said.
Residents of the Scanlon’s Ashland neighborhood told FOX25 thee has been more coyote activity this year than any year they can remember.
Wildlife experts say drought conditions sometimes force animals to seek water in new places.
In California, which has experienced a long and severe drought, this translated into an increase in coyote sightings in neighborhoods.
“Drought can certainly cause wildlife to be stressed and be looking for available water resources wherever they are,” David Mizejewski from the National Wildlife Federation said.
Massachusetts state officials, however, say the drought here is not the same as the drought on the west coast.
In fact, State Wildlife Biologist Trina Monuzzi tells FOX25 high coyote activity in summer is actually normal.
“The young are actually learning how to hunt,” she said. “What we do have is a lot more of the small mammals which are their main prey source -- especially this year.”"
other,"Global economic conditions picked up further over the course of 2017. Indications are that this strength has continued into 2018. This upswing has been most pronounced in manufacturing and industrial activity, and has been more synchronised across economies than has been the case for some time. GDP growth is above estimates of potential in a number of economies and labour markets have tightened further. Although commodity prices have generally risen, broader inflationary pressures have been slow to emerge.The Chinese economy continued to grow solidly over 2017. Government policies to reduce pollution, dampen housing speculation and contain financial risk are likely to constrain output growth somewhat, with conditions in China's industrial sector already having softened in recent months. Financial conditions continue to be supportive overall, and China is benefiting from the global upswing."

Typhoon,"Hurricane Delta, which made landfall about 11 miles (about 18 kilometers) from where the devastating Hurricane Laura hit a little more than a month earlier, cost 2.9 billion in the United States and was linked to six deaths in the U.S. and Mexico, according to a report from the National Hurricane Center.
The report released Tuesday details the hurricane’s origins, trajectory and things such as wind speed and storm surge when it made landfall in southwestern Louisiana.
The Center releases similar reports on every named storm that hits during a season. The reports on some of the 2020 season’s most devastating hurricanes - including Laura, Iota and Zeta - have yet to be published.
In the United States, two people died as a direct result of Delta — a 19-year-old woman and a 49-year-old man who both drowned in rip currents near Destin, Florida — and there were two indirect deaths associated with electrocutions and fires. In Mexico, there were two indirect deaths — an electrocution and a fall — linked to the hurricane.
The Center classifies deaths as direct or indirect. Direct deaths are those considered directly tied to the storm such as drowning in storm surge or being in a house that collapses from wind. Someone who dies of a heart attack during a storm or is electrocuted by a downed power line, for example, is considered an indirect death.
The hurricane came ashore as a Category 2 storm with winds of 97 miles per hour (156 miles per hour) and produced a storm surge that got up to nine feet (2.7 meters) in some areas east of where it made landfall near Creole, the report said. While Laura’s earlier damage came through devastating winds, Delta produced huge rain totals in some areas particularly between Lake Charles and Alexandria. Nearly 18 inches of rain fell in LeBleu Settlement northeast of Lake Charles, the report said.
The Center also released a report Tuesday on Hurricane Marco. That storm, which came days before the much more destructive Laura made landfall on August 27, was originally thought to have made landfall at the mouth of the Mississippi River on Aug. 24 based on satellite imagery. But in the report, the Center said further research suggests it stayed just south and did not actually make landfall. There were no reports of casualties linked to the storm and only minor damage.
The 2020 Atlantic hurricane season set multiple records while producing a record 30 named storms. There were so many that the list of 21 conventional names was exhausted and the Greek alphabet was used for only the second time. The season also saw the second-highest number of hurricanes on record after 13 of the storms reached hurricane status."

The quake was at a depth of 85.2 km, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS), and struck offshore 18 km east-southeast of Wau."
wildfires,"Many Australians just lost their summer, thanks to the recent bushfire crisis.
These intense fires devastated communities, destroyed wildlife populations and left many feeling bereft and overwhelmed.
To convey a sense of the unprecedented scale of the disaster much of the reporting focused on numbers, but where did these figures come from?
Here, we take a close-up look at five of these numbers: where they come from, and whether they're for real.
The most obvious way to communicate the scale of a fire disaster — and compare it to other fires — is by focusing on the area of land the fire that has burned.
According to the Department of Home Affairs, to date more than 12.6 million hectares across Australia have been burned.
To put that in some perspective, in New South Wales alone more than 5.4 million hectares have been burned, said Ben Shepherd from the NSW Rural Fire Service.
""An average fire season here in New South Wales is typically at around 300,000 hectares,"" Inspector Shepherd said."
drought,"A drought that has lasted almost a year continues across central and southern Saskatchewan.
Parts of the province have been running a moisture deficit since November 2016.
“It’s almost as if nature has forgotten how to rain in parts of Saskatchewan,” Environment Canada Senior Climatologist David Phillips said.
According to the Canadian Drought Monitor, an area along the international border, including Coronach, is experiencing exceptional drought conditions.
Regina, Assiniboia and Swift Current regions continue to be in an extreme drought.
Severe drought conditions encompass Leader, Watrous and Estevan areas.
Below are the top 10 driest November to September periods on record for Regina, Moose Jaw, Swift Current, Yorkton and Saskatoon."
other,"Persisting positive yield differentials between global (US treasuries) and Indian G-secs and the stability of the Indian rupee in the foreign exchange market relative to other currencies provided congenial conditions for foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) who were net buyers in the debt market during the most part of H2 (Chart IV.10), notwithstanding intermittent reversals following the Budget announcement. FPIs made investment of _606 billion in G-secs in 2017-18, resulting in utilisation of 92.9 per cent of the extant limit on G-sec investment. In addition, FIIs also made investment in state development loans (SDLs) of _40 billion.In the primary segment, two discerning features characterised opposite ends of the spectrum. At the short end of the G-sec market, T-Bill issuances declined during H2 with the steady improvement in the central government¡¯s cash balances. Yields on T-Bills, however tracked the benchmark and hardened till February before cooling down during March owing to surplus liquidity emerging from the redemption of T-Bills issued under Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS) in April-May 2017 (Chart IV.11)."
other,"The October bi-monthly statement projected inflation to rise and range between 4.2-4.6 per cent in the second half of this year, including the impact of increase in house rent allowance (HRA) by the Centre. The headline inflation outcomes have evolved broadly in line with projections. Going forward, the inflation path will be influenced by several factors. First, moderation in inflation excluding food and fuel observed in Q1 of 2017-18 has, by and large, reversed. There is a risk that this upward trajectory may continue in the near-term. Second, the impact of HRA by the Central Government is expected to peak in December. The staggered impact of HRA increases by various state governments may push up housing inflation further in 2018, with attendant second order effects. Third, the recent rise in international crude oil prices may sustain, especially on account of the OPEC¡¯s decision to maintain production cuts through next year. In such a scenario, any adverse supply shock due to geo-political developments could push up prices even further. Despite recent increase in prices of vegetables, some seasonal moderation is expected in near months as winter arrivals kick in. Prices of pulses have continued to show a downward bias. The GST Council in its last meeting has brought several retail goods and services to lower tax brackets, which should translate into lower retail prices, going forward. On the whole, inflation is estimated in the range 4.3-4.7 per cent in Q3 and Q4 of this year, including the HRA effect of up to 35 basis points, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 1).Turning to GVA projections, Q2 growth was lower than that projected in the October resolution. The recent increase in oil prices may have a negative impact on margins of firms and GVA growth. Shortfalls in kharif production and rabi sowing pose downside risks to the outlook for agriculture. On the positive side, there has been some pick up in credit growth in recent months. Recapitalisation of public sector banks may help improve credit flows further. While there has been weakness in some components of the services sector such as real estate, the Reserve Bank¡¯s survey indicates that the services and infrastructure sectors are expecting an improvement in demand, financial conditions and the overall business situation in Q4. Taking into account the above factors, the projection of real GVA growth for 2017-18 of the October resolution at 6.7 per cent has been retained, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2)."
wildfires,"As a new, fast-moving wildfire tears through El Dorado County, high-speed winds are expected to sweep Northern California this week — fanning the flames and bringing power shutoffs, smoky air and the risk of additional blazes to the Bay Area.
Since igniting three days ago, the Caldor Fire has rapidly grown into one of the region’s most troubling fires — exploding to 22,919 acres Tuesday, torching buildings in multiple Sierra foothill communities and injuring two people. Strong winds and hot, dry conditions that have accelerated the blaze’s spread are only expected to increase over the next few days, forcing crews to brace for aggressive fire growth and potential runs of more than three miles at a time.
As the wind shifts, smoke from the Caldor Fire and the much larger Dixie Fire to the north is expected to drift into the Bay Area and affect air quality on Wednesday and Thursday, said Brian Garcia, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. The air will be worst in the North Bay, but the impact will be felt across the entire region, Garcia said.
“Everybody’s going to notice it,” he said.
The Bay Area Air Quality Management District issued an advisory for the region due to the smoke, anticipating moderate air quality on Wednesday.
Wildfires already have consumed more than 1.1 million acres in the state so far this year — compared to about 854,000 acres at this point in 2020, according to Cal Fire. Resources are spread thin, said Diana Swart, public information officer for the Amador-El Dorado unit of Cal Fire, with more than 6,000 firefighters battling the massive Dixie Fire which has been burning in Butte, Plumas and Lassen counties for more than a month.
“That’s a struggle — that and the dry vegetation,” she said. “We’ve been in a drought now for quite a few years and this year is one of the driest. So that’s what we’re dealing with. The very dry vegetation and some wind activity that’s pushing through some very rugged, steep terrain.”"
drought,"More than 58 000 ha (143 000 acres) of rice have been damaged in Mekong Delta due to the region's worst drought in history, according to Vietnam's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD).
The MARD, in cooperation with the People's Committee of Long An Province, held a conference to discuss the results of the prevention of drought, saltwater intrusion, and water shortage during the 2019/20 dry season. The organizations also talked about solutions to develop sustainable agriculture.
The increase in saline intrusion was due to the water shortage from the upper Mekong River. During the 2019/20 dry season, the water to the Mekong Delta was lower than that in previous years, affecting 10 out of 13 provinces in the region. The area affected by salinity was 1.68 million ha (4.15 million acres), which was higher than the total area of 50 376 ha (124 481 acres) in 2016.
MARD cooperated with relevant ministries and the Mekong Delta provinces to actively cope with the situation and apply solutions, at the same time implement the Prime Minister's directive. 
Around 41 900 ha (103 500 acres) of winter-spring rice crop were affected this year, 26 000 ha (64 250 acres) of rice of which ended in a dead loss. Nearly 6 650 ha (16 430 acres) of fruit trees were impacted by saltwater intrusion, 355 ha (877 acres) of which was a total loss. More than 8 715 ha (21 500 acres) of the aquafarming area were damaged, as well as a wide swath of vegetable crops.
Also, due to prolonged drought, 96 000 families or about 430 000 individuals suffered water shortage for daily living, which was lower than the dry season in 2015/16 when there were 210 000 households affected.
Landslides occurred in many areas in the Mekong Delta as drought and prolonged shortage of water resulted in low water levels on the canals. 
Nguyen considered the drought and saltwater intrusion in the 2019/20 dry season as the most severe in history. However, the early guidance of the government has helped the agricultural sector to enforce coping solutions. The level of loss of agricultural production and livelihoods was also reduced significantly.
Last week, the intergovernmental Mekong River Commission (MRC) released a statement urging China to be more transparent over its dam operations on the Mekong River following the record lows of the water that threatened millions of livelihoods in various Southeast Asian countries."

The State Disaster Management Committee, in a statement today, said only three PPS are still operating in Tenom, accommodating 95 people from 24 families, while the remaining 602 people, from 155 families, are at four PPS in Beaufort.  “The situation in several flood hotspot areas in the two districts is reported to be improving,” it said, adding that the floods affected 47 villages in Tenom and 75 villages Beaufort."
Typhoon,"Dolly, the fourth named storm of the hurricane season, forms off the Northeast coast (CNN)What was once Subtropical Depression Four strengthened into Tropical Storm Dolly on Tuesday. This makes it the fourth named storm of an already busy Atlantic Hurricane season. ""The wind field has contracted to make Dolly no longer a subtropical system,"" says CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen.Satellite-derived wind data shows that the storm has strengthened to 45 mph, the National Hurricane Center said in a special update. This is the third time this decade a ""D"" named storm has formed this early in the Atlantic, says CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward. ""Dolly has formed in the North Atlantic -- the 3rd earliest 4th Atlantic named storm formation on record (since 1851),"" tweeted Colorado State University research scientist Phil Klotzbach."
other,"Global economic conditions are continuing to provide a favourable environment for the Australian economy. The expansion underway over the past few years was initially led by the United States and China, but it has become more broadly based over time. Conditions in Japan have improved markedly over the past year, and there has been good growth elsewhere in east Asia and in other emerging economic regions. There have also been some signs of improvement recently in the euro area. Growth in world GDP is estimated to have been well above average in 2005, and most observers expect this to continue in 2006. The most recent economic indicators have tended to strengthen these expectations.Against this background central banks in the major economies, with the exception of Japan, have begun normalising official interest rates from the unusually low levels they reached in the early part of the decade. The United States is now quite advanced in this process, with the Fed funds rate back to a level generally regarded as close to normal. Central banks in other major countries are at a much earlier stage, however, and world policy rates on average remain well below normal. Long-term interest rates are also relatively low, having remained broadly steady in the face of rising official rates. The combination of strong economic growth, low inflation and low interest rates has contributed to buoyant conditions in world financial markets. Spreads on emerging market and corporate debt have narrowed, and global equity prices have increased solidly in each of the past three years."
wildfires,"A wildfire in the Mark Twain National Forest just west of the Bixby/Viburnum area was 40 percent contained as of 4 p.m. Friday afternoon. The fire has already consumed more than 450 acres according to the U.S. Forest Service.
The fire was called in at about 10:15 a.m. Thursday and fire fighters arrived on the scene by 11 a.m. Additional fire departments were called to help battle the blaze, which started at the intersection of Iron County Road 73 and Highway 32. The fire continued to move east on Highway 32 throughout the night and into Friday morning.
Increased winds from the southeast pushed the fire over Highway 32 where another section of land, just west of Council Bluff Lake, was devastated, forcing the highway’s closure. It has been closed from highway 49 south to Route A.
Council Bluffs campground is still open as of press time, but may be difficult to get to, and the campground could be closed if it becomes necessary.
""What is really driving this fire is low humidity and high temperatures. This creates a situation where the fire is actually pushing itself. It is essentially creating its own wind. This is a situation we see often out west, such as in the Colorado Fires, but not usually in Missouri,"" said Susan Zornek-Stevens, U.S Forest Service Public Information Officer.
There were some residential structures within a mile of the fire, but no residents had been evacuated as of press time. Officials say they will take that precaution if the fire spreads any closer to those homes.
Jody Eberly with the Mark Twain National Forest said things are so dry, the fires are getting into the tops of the trees as well.
She is cautioning people to be extra careful. With conditions this dry, even throwing a cigarette out of a car window or on the ground from the sidewalk can quickly start a large fire that could endanger many homes and lives.
At press time officials have not determined the exact nature of the blaze, but say it was likely set by a careless motorist. The Forest Service implores residents to be cautious during these severe drought conditions."
other,"The world economy experienced a marked contraction in late 2008 and early 2009, with large declines in industrial production and international trade. Almost all developed countries recorded a decline in output in the December quarter, and most appear to have experienced a further decline in the March quarter. Growth also slowed significantly in all emerging market countries.The sharp and synchronised nature of the downturn is largely accounted for by the substantial falls in consumer and business confidence that followed the financial events in September 2008, including the failure of Lehman Brothers in the United States. As confidence declined and uncertainty and risk aversion increased, both consumers and businesses delayed or cancelled their spending and production plans, especially for consumer durables and capital goods. Credit conditions simultaneously tightened considerably around the world, as severe strains developed in the global financial system."

drought,"More people have been displaced by drought in western Afghanistan than those uprooted by conflict, the United Nations has said.
A total of 275,000 people were displaced by drought this year, 52,000 more than the number who fled conflict, with more than two million threatened by the effects of water shortages.
Reports from the UN and aid charities described farmers lacking seeds to sow, following crop failures in some areas, and livestock dying from the lack of anything to eat。
Afghanistan, where nearly 20 million people rely on farming, has suffered a 45 per cent drop in agricultural output this year as drought hit the country, officials at the ministry of agriculture have said.
At least 120,000 people fleeing the drought arrived in the town of Qala-e-Naw, in Badghis province, in the week leading up to 9 September, the UN humanitarian office reported.
A second UN report, which contained data covering August, said more than 100,000 people may have moved to Herat city for the same reason by the end of last month.
The report estimated 2.2 million Afghans would be affected by the drought this year.
In Qala-e-Naw, where there are an estimated 66,500 drought-displaced people, supplies and humanitarian aid are already insufficient to meet the needs of newly arrived families.
The UN cited an assessment by aid charity World Vision International, which said 99 per cent of people in Badghis thought their food situation was worse or a lot worse than a year ago.
Most farmers lost last season’s harvest and nearly all of them lacked seeds for the new planting season, the UN study said, noting reports saying around 40 percent of livestock have been lost in Badghis due to a lack of pasture and fodder."
wildfires,"Large wildfires raging throughout California have claimed at least 44 lives statewide, destroyed thousands of structures and prompted hundreds of thousands to evacuate. A fire actively burning in Northern California took at least 42 lives, becoming the deadliest fire on state record.
Large fires have scorched populated areas of California over the past week, including the Camp Fire, north of Sacramento, which incinerated the entire town of Paradise, and the Woolsey Fire, which burns northwest of Los Angeles. Firefighters on Monday also battled the Rocky Peak fire, which sprung up near where the Woolsey fire began and forced the shutdown of the Route 118 freeway. The Camp Fire has become one of California’s most destructive fires in at least a century, according to the Associated Press.
Wildfires are a natural and annual occurrence in California, typically appearing toward the end of the long, dry summers. In four out of five cases, people provide the igniting spark. At the same time, the environment has also become more flammable. As the state grows hotter and increasingly subject to prolonged droughts, and as more people live in high risk areas, the fires simply get bigger, more severe and more costly to put out."

valcano eruption,"DOH sets price freeze for medicines, masks in Taal eruption-hit areas Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, January 15) — The Department of Health (DOH) has ordered a temporary stop in the increase in prices of medicines and medical supplies in areas affected by the Taal Volcano eruption. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III signed the department memorandum on Tuesday following confirmed reports of profiteering and hoarding. DOH set the lowest and maximum ceiling prices for emergency medicines, such as analgesics, antibiotics, antibacterial medicines, respiratory tract medicines, and anti-asthma medicines. Price freeze was also set for medical supplies, such as the highly in demand N95 face mask. DOH said the N95 mask should cost between P45-P105, while disposable surgical masks should cost a maximum of P8 per piece. The prices of N95 masks skyrocketed to P200 per piece a day after Taal Volcano started spewing smoke and ash on January 12."

Since the time of the previous Monetary Policy Report in July, the Federal Reserve has proposed a comprehensive overhaul of the regulations governing consumer mortgage transactions, and we are collaborating with the Department of Housing and Urban Development to assess how we might further increase transparency in the mortgage process.8 We have issued rules implementing enhanced consumer protections for credit card accounts and private student loans as well as new rules to ensure that consumers have meaningful opportunities to avoid overdraft fees.9 In addition, the Federal Reserve has implemented an expanded consumer compliance supervision program for nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies and foreign banking organizations"
other,"Retail inflation, measured by y-o-y change in the CPI, declined from 3.4 per cent in October 2018 to 2.2 per cent in December, the lowest print in the last eighteen months. Continuing deflation in food items, a sharp fall in fuel inflation and some edging down of inflation excluding food and fuel contributed to the decline in headline inflation.Five constituents of the food group _ vegetables, sugar, pulses, eggs and fruits, accounting for about 30 per cent of food group _ were in deflation in December. Inflation in respect of other major food sub-groups _ cereals, milk, and oils and fats _ was subdued. Within cereals, rice prices declined for the fourth consecutive month in December. Inflation in prices of meat and fish and non-alcoholic beverages showed an uptick, while it remained sticky for prepared meals.Inflation in the fuel and light group fell from 8.5 per cent in October to 4.5 per cent in December, pulled down by a sharp decline in the prices of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), reflecting softening of international petroleum product prices. Kerosene inflation continued to edge up due to the calibrated increase in its administered price.CPI inflation excluding food and fuel decelerated to 5.6 per cent in December from 6.2 per cent in October, dragged down mainly by the moderation in the prices of petrol and diesel in line with the decline in international petroleum product prices. Housing inflation continued to edge down as the impact of the house rent allowance (HRA) increase for central government employees dissipated. However, inflation in several of the sub-groups _ household goods and services; health; recreation and amusement; and education _ firmed up in December, offsetting much of the impact of lower inflation in petrol, diesel and housing."

Now, Cristobal is heading into Canada as an extra-tropical storm, bringing widespread thunderstorms to the Great Lakes region. ""As the remnants of Cristobal lifts very quickly to the north, the system will bring strong severe storms to portions of the Great Lakes, more specifically Michigan and Ohio this afternoon,"" CNN meteorologist Haley Brink says. ""Due to the speed of this system, severe damaging winds may be the more widespread threat through the afternoon and evening hours, with tornadoes also possible."" Cristobal's remnants are providing a very moist environment for these storms to thrive. And with an advancing cold front right on its heels, the two systems will clash and bring tropical-like storms to the region and a line of strong storms associated with the advancing cold front. According to the Weather Prediction Center, ""a sharp cold front in the wake of Cristobal will spread strong gusty winds and some thunderstorms throughout the Central Plains and Upper Midwest today, and into the Great Lakes through tonight."" The Storm Prediction Center has issued a moderate risk -- level 4 of 5 -- for severe thunderstorms, including tornadoes for Wednesday afternoon and tonight.

earthquake,"Magnitude 4.9 earthquake strikes near Yerevan, Armenia An earthquake of magnitude 4.9 occurred only 7 minutes ago 11 km south of Yerevan, Armenia, the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) reported. The quake hit at a very shallow depth of 0 km beneath the epicenter near Yerevan, Armenia, early afternoon on Saturday 13 February 2021 at 3:29 pm local time. The exact magnitude, epicenter, and depth of the quake might be revised within the next few hours or minutes as seismologists review data and refine their calculations, or as other agencies issue their report. Our monitoring service identified a second report from the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) which listed the quake at magnitude 4.6. Based on the preliminary seismic data, the quake should have been widely felt by almost everyone in the area of the epicenter. It might have caused light to moderate damage. Moderate shaking probably occurred in Tokhanshalu (pop. 18,900) located 7 km from the epicenter. In Yerevan (pop. 1,093,500) located 11 km from the epicenter, Artashat (pop. 20,600) 14 km away, Vagharshapat (pop. 46,500) 20 km away, Ejmiatsin (pop. 49,500) 20 km away, Abovyan (pop. 35,700) 24 km away, Ashtarak (pop. 18,800) 27 km away, and Ararat (pop. 28,800) 33 km away, the quake should have been felt as light shaking. Weak shaking might have been felt in Gyumri (pop. 148,400) located 97 km from the epicenter.

earthquake,"Australia, NZ cancel tsunami warnings as threat from Pacific quake eases WELLINGTON/SYDNEY (REUTERS, AFP) _ A 7.7 magnitude undersea earthquake struck the South Pacific region on Thursday (Feb 10), triggering a brief tsunami warning for Australia and New Zealand that was cancelled, with no immediate reports of damage.  The European Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) said the quake’s epicentre was 417 kilometres east of Tadine, New Caledonia, and at a depth of 10 km.  Tsunami centres across the region sent alerts for the public to stay off beaches and shore areas due to risks of unexpected currents and unusual waves. Those warnings were later cancelled, and authorities said any tsunami threat to mainlands in Australia and New Zealand had passed.  “Based on the most recent modelling and decreasing tsunami amplitudes at North Cape, Great Barrier Island and the East Cape, the tsunami threat has passed for New Zealand,” the National Emergency Management Agency said in a statement.  “There could still be large unexpected currents and the public are advised to continue to take precautions in coastal zones for the rest of today,” it added."
other,"Retail inflation, measured by the y-o-y change in the CPI, fell from 4.9 per cent in June to 3.7 per cent in August, dragged down by a decline in food inflation. Some softening of inflation in items other than food and fuel also contributed to the decline. Adjusting for the estimated impact of an increase in house rent allowance (HRA) for central government employees, headline inflation was at 3.4 per cent.Inflation in the food and beverages group declined sharply in the absence of seasonal uptick in prices of fruits and vegetables. Of the three key vegetables, the prices of tomatoes declined due to strong mandi arrivals, while those of onions and potatoes remained muted. Continued deflation in prices of pulses and sugar accentuated the decline in food inflation. Inflation in other items of food _ cereals, meat and fish, milk, spices and non-alcoholic beverages _ remained benign.Inflation in the fuel and light group continued to rise on the back of a significant increase in liquefied petroleum gas prices, tracking international product prices. Kerosene prices rose as oil marketing companies reduced subsidies in a calibrated manner. While remaining elevated, CPI inflation excluding food and fuel moderated due to softening in inflation in housing; pan, tobacco and intoxicants; personal care; and transportation.While the September round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s survey of households reported a sharp uptick of 50 basis points in three-month ahead inflation expectations over the last round, one-year ahead expectations moderated by 30 basis points. Inflation expectations for both input prices and selling prices of manufacturing firms, polled by the Reserve Bank¡¯s industrial outlook survey, firmed up in Q2:2018-19. The manufacturing and services PMIs also reported an increase in input costs and selling prices in Q2, reflecting a pass-through of higher costs to clients. On the other hand, growth in wages in the rural and organised manufacturing sectors remained contained."
other,"Outside the United States, economic activity strengthened last year, and at present global growth seems to be on a good track. The economies of our North American neighbors, Canada and Mexico, appear to be expanding at a solid pace. Especially significant have been signs that Japan could be emerging from its protracted slump and its battle with deflation. In the euro area, expansion has been somewhat modest by global standards, but recent indicators suggest that growth could be strengthening there as well. Economies in emerging Asia generally continue to expand strongly. In particular, growth in China remained vigorous in 2005.Expanding foreign economic activity helped drive a vigorous advance in U.S. exports in 2005, while the growth of real imports slowed. Nonetheless, the nominal U.S. trade deficit increased further last year, exacerbated in part by a jump in the value of imported petroleum products that almost wholly reflected the sharply rising price of crude oil."
other,"When Israel's prime minister visited the White House on Friday, for the first time in 12 years it was someone other than Benjamin Netanyahu.
That alone lent the talks a sense of renewal, even though stark differences remain between President Joe Biden and his new Israeli counterpart Naftali Bennett.
""I bring with me a new spirit,"" Bennett said in warm remarks from the Oval Office as the meeting was getting underway, ""a spirit of good will, a spirit of hope, a spirit of decency and honesty, a spirit of unity and bipartisanship, of folks who -- as you suggested -- harbor very different political opinions, even opposing, yet we all share the deep passion to work together to build a better future for Israel.”
""We've become close friends,"" Biden said, though he'd just met the new prime minister for the first time an hour earlier.
Friday's meeting had originally been scheduled for a day earlier but was postponed in the wake of a deadly terrorist attack in Kabul that killed 13 American service members. Biden cleared his schedule for meetings with top national security officials. He and Bennett spoke by phone on Thursday evening ahead of the rescheduled talks.
The delay by a day means Bennett, an Orthodox Jew, will remain in Washington until Saturday evening after the Sabbath ends, his office said.
In warm remarks, Biden hailed Bennett's coalition as the ""most diverse government in Israeli history,"" and said the US was committed to ensuring Iran never develops a nuclear weapon.
""We're putting diplomacy first. If diplomacy fails, we're ready to turn to other options,"" he said, without elaborating.
He spoke in only broad terms about other issues in the region, saying he planned to discuss ""ways for increased peace and prosperity for Israelis and Palestinians.""
""The US will always be there for Israel. It's an unshakable partnership between our two nations,"" Biden said.
Biden's meeting with Bennett was arranged quickly after the Israeli leader formed a government earlier this summer, depriving Netanyahu of another term in office.
The enthusiasm in Washington for new Israeli leadership was palpable: Biden telephoned Bennett less than two hours after he was sworn in, and US officials immediately began work toward setting up a meeting.
Bennett arrived in Washington vowing to reset his country's ties to the United States. Animosity lingered from the ice-cold relationship between Netanyahu and former President Barack Obama, whose pursuit of diplomacy with Iran led to tense disagreements.
Some White House officials believed Netanyahu would resume his adversarial stance with Biden. The view was cemented when Israel began curtailing intelligence sharing this spring, according to The New York Times."

A new eruption could occur at any moment, the military governor of Congo’s North Kivu province, Lt. Gen. Constant Ndima Kongba, announced Thursday. He ordered the evacuation of 10 of the 18 neighborhoods in the city of nearly 2 million residents. Full of fear, residents from many of the unlisted neighborhoods also fled after no warnings of Saturday’s eruption left so many in harm’s way."
drought,"The latest version of the federal United States Drought Monitor map has put much of California's San Francisco Bay area under the extreme drought, as of Thursday, May 6, 2021. The dry conditions also placed almost 3.7 million ha (9.3 million acres) of land under extreme wildfire risk, which is 130 percent higher than the five-year average.
""The second-highest level of drought covers just about all of our neighborhood, only that small sliver in northern Mendocino County remains in severe'. It's not just here,"" said ABC7 News Meteorologist Mike Nicco, who described the situation as ""unfortunate, but not a surprise.""
""The entire state saw that 'extreme' category goes from 53 percent to nearly 73 percent,"" he added. ""Nearly three-fourths of our wonderful, beautiful state is now suffering in the second-highest level of drought.""
Richard Heim, a meteorologist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and one of the authors of the recent map, also noted that the drought is ""no surprise, especially in Northern California,"" as the state has seen consecutive dry winters, with the last season being the third driest on record.
The map classified the drought levels on a color-coded scale, from yellow or abnormally dry to maroon or exceptional drought.
The April 29 map showed the most severe conditions forming along the southern border with Nevada and Arizona, with red code or extreme drought covering much of California's southern and northern areas, and orange or severe drought spreading across much of the rest of the state."

drought,"Alaska’s wettest region is experiencing an extreme drought for the first time in recorded history, climate scientists say.
The southernmost portion of Southeast Alaska, including Ketchikan, Prince of Wales Island, Wrangell and Metlakatla, has been in a drought for the last two years, said Rick Thoman, a climatologist at the Fairbanks-based Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy.
Last week, though, the drought was updated to a D3, or “extreme” drought, the second-highest category the U.S. Drought Monitor measures. It’s the first time those conditions have ever been recorded in Alaska, according to the Drought Monitor.
Meanwhile, areas experiencing lesser “severe” and “moderate” droughts on the Panhandle have expanded, the Drought Monitor said.
Droughts look different in the rainforest climate of Southeast Alaska than elsewhere in the world, though, with the key difference being that the region is still getting quite a lot of precipitation by most standards, Thoman said.
Ketchikan has averaged about 100 inches annually since 2017, and Metlakatla has seen between 80 and 90, climatologists say.
“In the mass amount of the world that would be an immense amount of rain,” Thoman said.
However, that’s still drastically less than what’s normal for the region. Ketchikan normally averages 150 inches of precipitation a year, and Metlakatla 118. This year, Ketchikan has seen about 5 inches less precipitation than it normally does by this time of year, according to data from the National Weather Service."
other,"Thus, apart from these quarterly fluctuations, the economy has largely extended the broad patterns of performance that were evident at the time of my July testimony. Most notably, output has continued to expand, but only modestly. As previously, overall growth has simultaneously been supported by relatively strong spending by households and weighed down by weak expenditures by businesses. Importantly, the favorable underlying trends in productivity have continued; despite little change last quarter, output per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose 3_ percent over the four quarters of 2002, an impressive gain for a period of generally lackluster economic performance. One consequence of the combination of sluggish output growth and rapid productivity gains has been that the labor market has remained quite soft. Employment turned down in the final months of last year, and the unemployment rate moved up, but the report for January was somewhat more encouraging."

drought,"The severe drought that struck California from 2011 to 2015 had an obvious impact on rivers, forests, and wildlife. Now, a new study shows it also had some surprising effects on the state’s notorious air pollution, adding new wrinkles to the state’s efforts to clear the skies.
Researchers have long known that plants can both help create and cleanse one dangerous air pollutant: ground-level ozone, which causes breathing problems and exacerbates lung damage. Plants can scrub ozone from the air by absorbing the pollutant through their stomata, or pores. But certain plants also emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that react with other atmospheric chemicals to create ozone.
Understanding how drought influences these two processes can be tricky. Dry conditions could cause ozone levels to rise, because plants shrink their stomata to prevent water loss, reducing their ability to remove pollution. But drought might also reduce ozone levels, because the stress could cause plants to produce fewer ozone-forming VOCs.
California’s lengthy drought, and the state’s extensive network of air pollution sensors, gave researchers a rare opportunity to see what happens in the real world. The team, led by atmospheric chemistry Ph.D. candidate Angelique Demetillo and environmental science professor Sally Pusede at the University of Virginia (UVA) in Charlottesville, examined more than a decade’s worth of satellite and sensor data that documented atmospheric conditions over Bakersfield and Fresno, two California cities that suffer from ozone pollution.
The drought’s impact on air quality changed over time, the researchers report this week in Environmental Science & Technology. Plants did remove less ozone, with absorption dropping by about 15% during the most severe years of the drought. But during the early years of the drought, trees and other plants were able to maintain their production of one key ozone-forming VOC, isoprene. The chemical helps plants like oak trees withstand heat stress, and it appears the trees draw on carbon stores to sustain isoprene production. “It’s like a person exercising; when you’ve burned through your recent consumption the body switches over and starts burning fat,” says Manuel Lerdau, an organismal ecologist at UVA and a co-author of the study.
After about 4 years of drought, however, the stress took its toll. In 2013, plant isoprene levels fell dramatically, by 65% in Bakersfield and 54% in Fresno. Overall, that meant up to a 20% dip in ozone pollution. And even after the drought ended, isoprene levels didn’t immediately rebound.
The plant VOC reduction might sound like good news for reducing California’s smog. But the complexity of atmospheric chemistry means droughts could actually complicate clean air efforts. That’s because, currently, regulations mostly focus on controlling nitrogen oxides (NOx) from sources like cars and factories, which react with VOCs to form ozone. When VOC levels are higher, those NOx controls help choke off smog-creating reactions. But reduce the VOCs, and NOx limits go from “being very effective to less effective,” Pusede says.
Such findings offer yet another complication for U.S. states and cities struggling to meet federal clean air standards, especially in drought-prone western states. Regulators have little ability to control VOC emissions from plants, notes Pusede, and “I don’t know if we’d want to even if we could.” But the study could help regulators do a better job of factoring drought into their air pollution models.
The work also “provides a road map for better quantifying these impacts in other places,” says atmospheric scientist Jessica Neu of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, who reviewed the paper. And because much of the needed data can now be collected by satellites, she says it opens the door to investigating “drought impacts on air quality globally.”"

drought,"More than 600 million people dependent on agriculture have been adversely affected by drought conditions across swathes of India.
Soaring temperatures since early June, averaging about 45 degrees, have stifled most of the country, while the progress of the annual monsoon rains, which normally bring relief from the searing heat and are a vital source of water, has been the slowest in 12 years.
An estimated 43 per cent of the country is affected by drought.
According to countrywide news reports, hundreds of villages and small towns in states including Uttar Pradesh in the east, Rajasthan and Maharashtra in the west and Andhra Pradesh in southern India are surrounded by parched farmland and have been deserted.
The country’s meteorological department predicts a deficient monsoon that in all likelihood may not be able to resuscitate some 91 life-sustaining reservoirs across India, where water levels in some cases are hovering at about 30 per cent capacity.
The federal government, however, has played down reports of water shortages. Addressing a press conference in New Delhi on Monday, water resources minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said media reports of the water crisis were exaggerated."
other,"High frequency indicators of services sector activity for May-June present a mixed picture. Tractor and motorcycle sales _ indicators of rural demand _ continued to contract. Amongst indicators of urban demand, passenger vehicle sales contracted for the eighth consecutive month in June; however, domestic air passenger traffic growth turned positive in June after three consecutive months of contraction. Commercial vehicle sales slowed down even after adjusting for base effects. Construction activity indicators slackened, with contraction in cement production and slower growth in finished steel consumption in June. Import of capital goods _ a key indicator of investment activity _ contracted in June. The services PMI expanded to 53.8 in July from 49.6 in June on increase in new business activity, new export orders and employment.Retail inflation, measured by y-o-y change in the CPI, edged up to 3.2 per cent in June from 3.0 per cent in April-May, driven by food inflation, even as fuel inflation and CPI inflation excluding food and fuel moderated.Inflation in the food group rose to 2.4 per cent in June from 2.0 per cent in May and 1.4 per cent in April, caused by a sharp pick up in prices of meat and fish, pulses and vegetables. Inflation also edged up in cereals, milk, spices and prepared meals. However, inflation in eggs and non-alcoholic beverages softened. Prices of fruits, and sugar and confectionery remained in deflation in June.Inflation in the fuel and light group moderated in June, with electricity moving into deflation. Fuels such as firewood and chips, and dung cake have been in deflation from April. Inflation in liquified petroleum gas (LPG) and subsidised kerosene prices, however, remained elevated.CPI inflation excluding food and fuel fell by 50 basis points to 4.1 per cent in May from 4.6 per cent in April, and remained unchanged in June. The softness in inflation in this category was broad-based across clothing and footwear; household goods and services; transport and communication; and recreation and amusement. Housing inflation remained unchanged over the last three months. Despite some moderation, inflation in the health sub-group remained elevated. Inflation in personal care and effects edged up in June due to a resurgence in gold prices.Inflation expectations of households remained unchanged in the July 2019 round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s survey for the three months ahead horizon as compared with the previous round, but they moderated by 20 basis points for the one year ahead horizon. Input cost pressures from prices of agricultural and industrial raw materials continued to ease in May and June. Nominal growth in rural wages was muted, while growth in staff costs in the manufacturing sector eased in Q1. Manufacturing firms participating in the Reserve Bank¡¯s industrial outlook survey expect input cost pressures to soften on account of lower raw material costs in Q2.Liquidity in the system was in large surplus in June-July 2019 due to (i) return of currency to the banking system; (ii) drawdown of excess cash reserve ratio (CRR) balances by banks; (iii) open market operation (OMO) purchase auctions; and (iv) the Reserve Bank¡¯s foreign exchange market operations. The Reserve Bank absorbed liquidity of _ 51,710 crore in June, _ 1,30,931 crore in July and _ 2,04,921 crore in August (up to August 6, 2019) on a daily net average basis under the LAF. Two OMO purchase auctions amounting to _ 27,500 crore were conducted in June, thereby injecting durable liquidity into the system. The weighted average call money rate (WACR) _ the operating target of monetary policy _ was aligned with the policy repo rate in June, but it traded below the policy repo rate on a daily average basis by 14 bps in July and 17 bps in August (up to August 6, 2019).The transmission of policy repo rate cuts to the weighted average lending rates (WALRs) on fresh rupee loans of banks has improved marginally since the last meeting of the MPC. Overall, banks reduced their WALR on fresh rupee loans by 29 bps during the current easing phase so far (February-June 2019). Merchandise exports contracted in June 2019, weighed down by the subdued performance of gems and jewellery, petroleum products, rice, engineering goods and cotton. After a modest increase in May, imports also contracted in June, impacted by falling prices of petroleum products and reduced imports of pearls and precious stones, transport equipment, machinery, metalliferous ores, chemicals and fertilisers. As the fall in imports was larger than that of exports, the trade deficit declined modestly during May-June on a y-o-y basis. Provisional data suggest a sequential decline in net services exports in May 2019. On the financing side, net foreign direct investment flows moderated to US$ 6.8 billion in April-May 2019 from US$ 7.9 billion a year ago. Net foreign portfolio investment (FPI) flows in the domestic capital market amounted to US$ 2.3 billion during the current financial year so far (up to August 5, 2019) as against net outflows of US$ 8.5 billion in the same period last year. India¡¯s foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 429.0 billion on August 2, 2019 _ an increase of US$ 16.1 billion over end-March 2019."
other,"Crude oil prices (Indian basket) increased from US$ 47 per barrel in June 2017 to US$ 78 in September 2018, an increase of 67 per cent in a span of 15 months. It is estimated that a US$ 10 increase in the price of international crude oil could reduce output in the OECD area by 20 bps after two years and raise inflation by 20 bps in the first year and by another 10 bps in the second year (OECD, 2011). For large net energy importers like India _ 80 per cent of India¡¯s crude oil requirement is met through imports _ recent estimates suggest that real GDP growth could decline from its current trajectory, while inflation could rise significantly above target, rendering the current favourable macroeconomic conditions vulnerable. In addition, it is estimated that for every US$ 1 increase in the price of a barrel of crude, India¡¯s current account deficit could widen by US$ 0.8 billion.Increases in crude oil prices impact economic activity through a variety of channels. Therefore, it is important to examine their effects in a general equilibrium context. The RBI¡¯s workhorse Quarterly Projection Model (QPM) in its Forecasting and Policy Analysis System (FPAS), which draws its analytical underpinnings from new Keynesian foundations7, provides the flexibility to incorporate these various channels. There is the cost push channel that operates through the prices of non-administered fuel products i.e., petrol and diesel, whereby energy costs impact firms¡¯ input costs, including transportation and other intermediate services. In addition, crude price increases are transmitted to the domestic economy through reduction in global demand, adverse price movements in respect of imports and exports, and undue volatility in the exchange rate. These diverse channels produce substitutions between energy and non-energy consumption, a reduction in output and an increase in inflation. The monetary policy response to these outcomes can, in turn, set off a chain of macroeconomic adjustments.The QPM depicts the various channels through which this transmission works (Chart I.1.1). A 10 per cent increase in international crude prices imparts a shock to petroleum product prices. Headline inflation goes up instantaneously by 13 bps, which takes up to a year to wear off. Furthermore, an increase in petroleum prices imparts cost push effects, which contribute about 15 bps to the increase in headline inflation. People react by spending less on non-oil items of consumption, reducing demand. To the extent that firms are not able to pass through the increase in oil prices to product prices, it reduces their profit margins, cash flows and investment. As a result, aggregate demand declines, leading to a negative contribution to inflation in the range of 5-10 bps. The crude oil price increase can also lead to a deterioration in the trade deficit, which can put downward pressure on the rupee, translating into an additional 10 bps increase in inflation. Consequently, monetary policy tightening is required to bring inflation back to target. The monetary policy reaction widens the output gap, compressing demand and thereby inflation. At its peak, the impact of the 10 per cent increase in crude oil price shock is expected to reduce growth by 15 bps and push up headline inflation by around 20 bps.The effect of crude oil prices on domestic inflation and output depends upon not only on the extent of the change in crude oil prices but also on their initial level. This is because retail petroleum product prices contain several elements which are largely fixed _ for example, excise duty and refining costs _ while the base price moves in line with the movements in international crude oil prices and the exchange rate. The value added tax component moves in line with prices charged to dealers (inclusive of excise duty). The higher the level of crude oil prices, the smaller is the proportion of fixed elements and larger is the impact of a given increase in crude oil prices on domestic petrol and diesel inflation, and hence on overall inflation and output (Chart I.1.2). For instance, an increase of 10 per cent in crude oil prices from US$ 30 per barrel to US$ 33 per barrel is estimated to increase inflation by 13 bps, while a similar order of increase from US$ 100 a barrel to US$ 110 a barrel could pull up inflation by around 22 bps."
other,"Monetary policy is not the same as fiscal policy, which is carried out through government spending and taxation.To understand monetary policy, it is important to understand a bit about the Federal Reserve, which is the central bank of the United States.The Federal Reserve is a bank for banks. It has several branches around the U.S. hold deposits for and lend to banks. As a means of ensuring the safety of the nation's financial institutions, the Federal Reserve requires banks to keep a strict percentage of their deposits on reserve at a Federal Reserve bank. The Federal Reserve determines the appropriate percentage, called the reserve requirement. If a bank is unable to meet its reserve requirement, it can borrow from the Federal Reserve to meet the requirement. The interest rate on these funds is called the discount rate. (Banks can also borrow the excess reserves of other banks, and this interest rate, called the federal funds rate, is determined by the open market. The Federal Reserve works to keep the discount rate close to the federal funds rate.)Now, let's assume that policymakers feel employment is too low and interest rates are too high. The Federal Reserve could enact expansionary monetary policy and encourage economic growth by doing one or all of these three things:
"
other,"The April 2018 MPR had projected an acceleration in real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2018-19 on the back of: (a) the goods and services tax (GST) stabilising; (b) improving credit offtake; (c) likely boost to investment from primary market resource mobilisation; (d) the process of recapitalisation of public sector banks and resolution of distressed assets under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC); (e) buoyant global trade; and (f) the thrust to the rural and infrastructure sectors in the Union Budget 2018- 19. Most of these have materialised, but to varying extent. However, global trade growth, as stated earlier, seems to be losing its synchronised momentum and this may hinder India¡¯s export prospects. The uneven spatial distribution of the south-west monsoon is another factor that has also imparted some uncertainty to the agricultural outlook and inflation.Taking into account the baseline assumptions, monetary policy tightening of 50 bps during June- August 2018, survey indicators and model forecasts, real GDP growth is projected to improve from 6.7 per cent in 2017-18 to 7.4 per cent in 2018-19 _ 8.2 per cent in Q1, 7.4 per cent in Q2, 7.3 per cent in Q3 and 7.1 per cent in Q4 _ with risks broadly balanced around this baseline path (Chart I.10). For 2019-20, structural model estimates indicate real GDP growth at 7.6 per cent, with quarterly growth rates in the range of 7.4-7.9 per cent, assuming a normal monsoon and no major exogenous or policy shocks. Strengthening investment activity and a further pick-up in credit growth impart an upside bias to the baseline growth projections. However, recent protectionist measures by major economies, threats of currency wars and the uncertainty associated with the pace of monetary policy normalisation in the US and other major advanced economies pose downside risks to the baseline growth path."
other,"Open market operations refer to the process by which the Federal Reserve buys or sells government securities. This process is considered ¡°open¡± because the Fed cannot pick and choose what securities dealers it wants to work with; instead, the securities dealers compete against each other on the price of the government securities market. The Federal Reserve discount rate is the interest rate charged to commercial banks and depository institutions on loans that are received from their regional Federal Reserve Bank¡¯s lending facility. The Fed is able to offer three different types of credit to depository institutions: primary, secondary, and seasonal credit. All three of these credits have different associated interest rates and are all fully secured. These rates are uniform across all of the Federal Reserve¡¯s banks and are determined by the Reserve Bank¡¯s Board of Directors. The reserve requirement is the amount of cash that the Federal Reserve requires banks must have on hand, in their vaults, or in the Federal Reserve Bank that is nearest the bank. Effective monetary policy is based strictly on the situation presented. One such example would be a situation in which a country is facing high unemployment and a recession at the same time. It¡¯s the job of the Federal Reserve to set the correct monetary policies in order to jumpstart the economy and lower the unemployment rate. In this case, the best solution would be to start an expansionary monetary policy. This policy would allow the Fed to lower interest rates, leading to an increased supply of cash, higher spending rates, and increased employment rates as businesses choose to grow instead of contract their labor force."
other,"In April this year, MAS re-centred the exchange rate policy band at the prevailing level of the S$NEER, and shifted the policy band from that of a zero percent appreciation path to one of modest and gradual appreciation.  This policy decision took into account the strong rebound of the Singapore economy from the downturn and incipient inflationary pressures emanating from domestic and external sources. Since then, the S$NEER (Chart 1) has fluctuated in the upper half of the policy band, reflecting investors¡¯ assessment of the more favourable growth outlook for Asia compared to the weaker prospects of the advanced economies.  Against conditions of abundant liquidity globally, the domestic three-month interbank rate has eased further to 0.50% as at end-September this year."
earthquake,"Earthquake rocks Japan off coast of Fukushima Prefecture TOKYO -- Dozens of people were injured and nearly 900,000 homes were without power after a 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck Japan late Saturday with an epicenter off the coast of Fukushima Prefecture. The Japan Meteorological Agency reported the quake occurred at 23:08 JST and said there is no risk of a tsunami, but there could be fluctuations in sea levels. The area in northeastern Japan suffered a devastating Tohoku quake in 2011 that severely damaged the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. The epicenter had a depth of about 55 km. Among the hardest hit areas is the city of Soma in Fukushima, roughly 40 km north of Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, and the Zao ski resort in Miyagi Prefecture. There were reports of landslides at multiple locations. Local authorities reported about 50 people were injured in Fukushima and Miyagi prefectures."
earthquake,"A strong earthquake has shaken central Chile, disrupting power and communications but causing no casualties or serious damage.
The quake had a magnitude of 7.1 and its epicentre was 70km (45 miles) northwest of Temuco with a depth of 25km, the US Geological Service said.
Hundreds of people in coastal areas fled to higher ground for fear of a tsunami, but no alert was issued.
An 8.8-magnitude quake in the same area last February caused huge destruction.
Chile's national emergency agency (Onemi) said there was no danger of a tsunami.
""Up until now we don't have any reports of injuries, there's no damage, just overloaded telephone lines and some partial power cuts,"" said Onemi's director, Vicente Nunez.
""We've told people to go back to their houses because there's no tsunami alert.""
The quake hit at 1720 (2020 GMT) and was centred about 600 kilometres (370 miles) southwest of the capital, Santiago.
The University of Chile's Institute of Seismology put the magnitude at 6.9.
Chile is still rebuilding after February's massive quake, which smashed infrastructure and triggered a tsunami that devastated several coastal towns, killing more than 400 people."
other,There are several actions that a central bank can take that are expansionary monetary policies. Monetary policies are actions taken to affect the economy of a country. The key steps used by a central bank to expand the economy include:
other,"The 6th bi-monthly resolution of 2017-18 in February projected CPI inflation at 5.1 per cent in Q4:2017-18; and in the range of 5.1-5.6 per cent in H1:2018-19 and 4.5-4.6 per cent in H2, including the HRA impact, with risks tilted to the upside. Actual inflation outcomes in January-February averaged 4.8 per cent, largely reflecting the sharp decline in vegetable prices and significant moderation in fuel group inflation. The available information suggests that vegetable prices continued to moderate in March as well. Accordingly, inflation in Q4:2017-18 is now projected at 4.5 per cent.Several factors are likely to influence the inflation outlook. First, with the sharp moderation in food prices in February-March, the inflation trajectory in H1:2018-19 is expected to be lower than the projection in the February statement, despite a likely reversal in food prices in H1. Overall food inflation should remain under check on the assumption of a normal monsoon and effective supply management by the Government. Second, international crude oil prices have become volatile in the recent period, with a distinct hardening bias in the second half of March, even as the increase in shale production was more than expected. This has adversely impacted the outlook for crude oil prices. Third, on current assessment, Indian domestic demand is expected to strengthen during the course of the year. Fourth, the statistical impact of an increase in HRA for central government employees under the 7th CPC will continue till mid-2018, and gradually dissipate thereafter.Taking these factors into consideration, projected CPI inflation for 2018-19 is revised to 4.7-5.1 per cent in H1:2018-19 and 4.4 per cent in H2, including the HRA impact for central government employees, with risks tilted to the upside (Chart 1). Excluding the impact of HRA revisions, CPI inflation is projected at 4.4-4.7 per cent in H1:2018-19 and 4.4 per cent in H2.Turning to the growth outlook, several factors are expected to accelerate the pace of economic activity in 2018-19. First, there are now clearer signs of revival in investment activity as reflected in the sustained expansion in capital goods production and still rising imports, albeit at a slower pace than in January. Second, global demand has been improving, which should encourage exports and boost fresh investment. On the whole, GDP growth is projected to strengthen from 6.6 per cent in 2017-18 to 7.4 per cent in 2018-19 _ in the range of 7.3-7.4 per cent in H1 and 7.3-7.6 per cent in H2 _ with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2)."
other,"World financial markets have come under severe stress in the period since the last Statement. Strains in credit markets escalated in early September, and the period since then has been marked by further large declines in equity prices and exceptional volatility across a range of markets. In response to these developments, a number of governments have announced measures to strengthen their financial systems, which should help to stabilise conditions over time.The renewed turmoil was sparked by the failure or near-failure of a number of financial institutions in the United States and Europe. In the United States, the largest mortgage institutions were effectively nationalised in early September along with one of the world's major insurance companies. September also saw the demise of the large US investment banks, with one bank filing for bankruptcy, another being taken over and the remaining two announcing their conversion to commercial banks. Several large financial institutions in the United Kingdom and the euro area came under stress during this period and required government assistance. All of this is part of a major reshaping of the financial landscape, in which the business models of some of the most highly leveraged institutions have proven to be no longer viable."

The fire was estimated at 104,309 acres (163 square miles) on Sunday evening — an increase of about 14,000 acres in 24 hours.
A largest of the spot fires, about 150 acres, was burning on the north side of Highway 50 near Kyburz. An abundance of dry fuel in the densely forested area has allowed embers to flare easily into fires, the fire update said.
Since Friday, Highway 50 has been closed between Pollock Pines and Meyers. It is open between Twin Bridges and Meyers only for residents of that area.
All the evacuation orders so far are in El Dorado County, except for a very small area of Placer County near Loon Lake. Warnings have been issued in Amador County.

drought,"At the end of April 2017, just 6 percent of the United States was afflicted by drought, the lowest level in 17 years of analysis by the U.S. Drought Monitor. That’s a substantial turnaround from a few years ago, when long and short term droughts spread across much of the nation.
The news marks a downward trend from mid-2011, when many areas of the country began to experience drier-than-average weather. That summer, a headline in the U.S. Drought Monitor read: “‘Exceptional drought’ record for United States set in July.” By July 12, almost 12 percent of the contiguous United States was in an “exceptional” drought—including states as far flung as Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Florida.
“Two parts of the country that have composed a big portion of [its] drought area in the last decade, Texas and California, now have mostly normal conditions,” said Matthew Rodell, a hydrologist at NASA. “Texas’s drought broke in 2015, and California’s drought was alleviated by atmospheric rivers that brought heavy rains earlier this year. Combine that with recent precipitation across much of the northwestern and central parts of the nation, and the result is a much-wetter-than-normal map.”
The maps above show the U.S. as it looked on April 25, 2017, and roughly five years earlier, on August 7, 2012. Much of the country is currently drought-free (shown in white). One outlier, as shown in the image above, is Georgia (deep orange). Parts of the state remain in extreme drought, and water levels at the Lake Lanier reservoir have sunk 8 feet below full, according to authorities. Areas of Florida, too, continue to suffer from severe drought conditions—a stark contrast to early 2016, when it received record rainfalls."
Typhoon,"Typhoon Utor, the strongest weather disturbance to enter the Philippines this year, battered the northern provinces in the main island of Luzon early Monday, stranding more than 8,000 passengers, forcing several flights and ferries to be canceled, knocking power out in a couple of provinces and leaving 23 fishermen missing, disaster officials said.
Classes in the Philippine capital of Manila and its neighboring provinces were suspended in anticipation of bad weather, but rains weren't as heavy and winds weren't as strong as they were in the provinces of Aurora, Nueva Viscaya and Isbela.
Typhoon Utor gathered speed as it made landfall on Aurora province, traveling at 22 kilometers per hour, at dawn Monday. Its sustained winds slowed to 140 kilometers per hour from 160 kph, while gustiness weakened to 170 kph from 200 kph. The typhoon's rain band also shrunk to 500 kilometers from 600 kilometers.
Typhoon Utor is expected to be over the South China Sea and outside from the Philippines' area of responsibility by early Tuesday, weather forecast Jori Loiz told a televised briefing Monday."
earthquake,"7.5M Earthquake Jolts Alaska: Scientists Warn Imminent 'Mega-Tsunami' Here Within a Year Due to Melting Ice The Alaska Peninsula was hit by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Monday afternoon, October 19, triggering a tsunami warning in the region. But the threat is not over. Scientists said the melting glaciers in Alaska region could unleash a 'mega-tsunami,' with a destructive high wall of water. As per the scientists, the glacier retreat in Prince William Sound—a narrow sea channel on the south coast of the U.S. state of Alaska—is now destabilizing mountain slopes and a massive tsunami could appear as early as 2021. A group of experts in an open letter to Alaskan authorities said that collapsing mountain slopes in Alaska caused 633 feet high waves in 2015. The researchers also noted that in west Greenland, a landslide in June 2017 produced a tsunami that killed four people and destroyed a large portion of the town of Nuugaatsiaq. According to the findings, the tsunami could impact areas frequently visited by tourists, fishing vessels, and hunters. The team of scientists believes that there is a possibility that this landslide-led tsunami ""will happen within the next year, and likely within 20 years."""

earthquake,"Mag 7.7 Quake Hits Between Cuba and Jamaica, but no Injuries HAVANA — A powerful magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck in the Caribbean Sea between Jamaica and eastern Cuba on Tuesday, shaking a vast area from Mexico to Florida and beyond, but there were no reports of casualties or heavy damage. The quake was centered 139 kilometers (86 miles) northwest of Montego Bay, Jamaica, and 140 kilometers (87 miles) west-southwest of Niquero, Cuba, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It hit at 2:10 p.m. (1910 GMT) and the epicenter was a relatively shallow 10 kilometers (6 miles) beneath the surface. Dr. Enrique Arango Arias, head of Cuba’s National Seismological Service, told state media that there had been no serious damage or injuries reported on the island. The Cayman Islands were rocked by several of the strong aftershocks that followed in the area, including one measured at magnitude 6.1. Water was cut off to much of Grand Cayman Island, and public schools were canceled for Wednesday Gov. Carlos Joaquin Gonzalez of Mexico’s Quintana Roo state, which is home to Cancun, Tulum and other popular beach resorts, said the earthquake was felt in multiple parts of the low-lying Caribbean state but there were no reports of damage or injuries. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center initially warned that the quake could generate waves 1 to 3 feet above normal in Cuba, Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, Honduras, Mexico and Belize, but issued a later message saying the danger had passed. The quake was felt strongly in Santiago, the largest city in eastern Cuba, said Belkis Guerrero, who works in a Roman Catholic cultural center in the center of Santiago “We were all sitting and we felt the chairs move,” she said. “We heard the noise of everything moving around.”"

Since the middle of last year, monthly payrolls have expanded by about 280,000, on average, and the unemployment rate has declined nearly 1/2 percentage point on net. Nevertheless, a range of labor market indicators suggest that there is still room for improvement. In particular, at 5.7 percent, the unemployment rate is still above most FOMC participants' estimates of its longer-run normal level, the labor force participation rate remains below most assessments of its trend, an unusually large number of people continue to work part time when they would prefer full-time employment, and wage growth has continued to be slow."
other,"In the third bi-monthly resolution of August 2018, CPI inflation was projected at 4.6 per cent in Q2:2018-19, 4.8 per cent in H2 and 5.0 per cent in Q1:2019-20, with risks evenly balanced. Excluding the HRA impact, CPI inflation was projected at 4.4 per cent in Q2:2018-19, 4.7-4.8 per cent in H2 and 5.0 per cent in Q1:2019-20. Actual inflation outcomes, especially in August, were below projections as the expected seasonal increase in food prices did not materialise and inflation excluding food and fuel moderated.Going forward, the inflation outlook is expected to be influenced by several factors. First, food inflation has remained unusually benign, which imparts a downward bias to its trajectory in the second half of the year. Inflation in key food items such as pulses, edible oils, sugar, fruits and vegetables remains exceptionally soft at this juncture. The risk to food inflation from spatially and temporally uneven rainfall is also mitigated, as confirmed by the first advance estimates that have placed production of major kharif crops for 2018-19 higher than last year¡¯s record. An estimate of the impact of an increase in minimum support prices (MSPs) announced in July has been factored in the baseline projections. Secondly, the price of the Indian basket of crude oil has increased sharply, by US$ 13 a barrel, since the last resolution. Thirdly, international financial markets remained volatile with EME currencies depreciating significantly. Finally, the HRA effect came off its peak in June and is dissipating gradually on expected lines. Taking all these factors into consideration, inflation is projected at 4.0 per cent in Q2:2018-19, 3.9-4.5 per cent in H2 and 4.8 per cent in Q1:2019-20, with risks somewhat to the upside (Chart 1). Excluding the HRA impact, CPI inflation is projected at 3.7 per cent in Q2:2018-19, 3.8 - 4.5 per cent in H2 and 4.8 per cent in Q1:2019-20.Turning to the growth outlook, the GDP print of Q1:2018-19 was significantly higher than that projected in the August resolution. Private consumption has remained robust and is likely to be sustained even as the recent rise in oil prices may have a bearing on disposable incomes. Improving capacity utilisation, larger FDI inflows and increased financial resources to the corporate sector augur well for investment activity. However, both global and domestic financial conditions have tightened, which may dampen investment activity. Rising crude oil prices and other input costs may also drag down investment activity by denting profit margins of corporates. This adverse impact will be alleviated to the extent corporates are able to pass on increases in their input costs. Uncertainty surrounds the outlook for exports. Tailwinds from the recent depreciation of the rupee could be muted by the slowing down of global trade and the escalating tariff war. Based on an overall assessment, GDP growth projection for 2018-19 is retained at 7.4 per cent as in the August resolution (7.4 per cent in Q2 and 7.1-7.3 per cent in H2), with risks broadly balanced; the path in the August resolution was 7.5 per cent in Q2:2018-19 and 7.3-7.4 per cent in H2. GDP growth for Q1:2019-20 is now projected marginally lower at 7.4 per cent as against 7.5 per cent in the August resolution, mainly due to the strong base effect (Chart 2)."

He said some 1,000 firefighters, backed by water-dropping helicopters and planes releasing fire retardants, were battling the blaze that forced the shutdown of several major highways. The metro line in the area was also closed as were schools and businesses.
""We've calculated that the fire is moving at a rate of 800 acres per hour,"" Terrazas said, adding that it would probably take days to get it under control.
Some 200 firefighters were meanwhile battling several other blazes in Riverside County, east of Los Angeles, including one that tore through a trailer park and was started by burning trash.
That blaze, dubbed the Sandalwood fire, destroyed 76 homes and buildings and killed an 89-year-old woman who was unable to escape the flames.
There were no immediate reports of injuries, but authorities ordered several hundred homes in the area be evacuated.
The National Weather Service said it expects the high winds fanning the flames to subside by Friday evening, making it easier for firefighters to do their work.
A red flag warning — which indicates ripe conditions for wildfires — remains in effect through Saturday.
""That seems to be the new normal in California,"" lamented Sylmar resident Oscar Mancillas, as he helplessly watched the flames spread in the hillside near his home.
""I mean the vegetation is so dry... but we're kind of lucky because it didn't grow back from the last fire,"" he told AFP. ""In California
you have to be earthquake ready and you have to be fire ready... and for those of us who have a family, it's a little daunting sometimes.""
The wildfires in the south erupted as California's largest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), implemented rolling power blackouts that affected some two million people in northern California this week.
About 312,000 customers remained in the dark Friday as a result of the shutoffs designed to reduce the threat of wildfire that can be sparked by lines downed in heavy winds.
Many schools and universities were also closed in northern parts of the state as people stocked up on gasoline, water, batteries and other basics, with frustration mounting at the blackouts condemned by some as ""third world.
""We're seeing a scale and scope of something that no state in the 21st century should experience,"" Governor Gavin Newsom said Thursday, blaming decades of what he called neglect and mismanagement by PG&E.
""This is not, from my perspective, a climate change story as much as a story about greed and mismanagement over the course of decades,"" Newsom said. ""Neglect, a desire to advance not public safety but profits.""
PG&E has defended the outages as necessary for safety reasons and has said it will take days before power is restored to all customers as inspections must be conducted on all power lines and equipment before the lights can be turned back on.
""This is not how we want to serve you but blackouts can happen again,"" Bill Johnson, the CEO of the company said Thursday.
Last November, PG&E's faulty power lines were determined to have sparked the deadliest wildfire in the state's modern history, which killed 86 and destroyed the town of Paradise."

MAS Core Inflation will experience modest but continuing pressures, before levelling off at just below 2% over the medium term.MAS has therefore decided to increase slightly the slope of the S$NEER policy band. The width of the policy band and the level at which it is centred will be unchanged. This measured adjustment follows the slight increase in the slope of the policy band in April 2018 from zero percent previously, and is consistent with a modest and gradual appreciation path of the S$NEER policy band that will ensure medium-term price stability."
drought,"The dry times are back. 
Drought has returned with a vengeance across much of the United States, with the worst conditions across southern and western parts of the nation.  
As of Thursday, 38.4% of the continental U.S. is in a drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. That is the highest percentage since the 40% recorded in May 2014.  
In California, which emerged from a brutal four-year drought last year, 44% of the state is now considered to be in a moderate drought. That's a dramatic jump from just last week, when the figure was 13%.
The Sierra provides water to millions of Californians. ""It's not nearly where we'd like to be,"" Frank Gehrke, a state official, said after measuring winter snowfall in the Sierra on Thursday.
Extremely warm weather is causing most of the precipitation to fall as rain instead of snow. ""This will have major ramifications for western water managers if they don’t get some major winter storms soon,"" Heim said.
Major winter storms have mostly bypassed the West, meaning that much-needed mountain snow has not fallen, said NOAA meteorologist Richard Heim, author of this week's Drought Monitor. This winter, snow sensors across the Sierra Nevada show the snowpack is just 30% of average for this time of year.
Whether California heads into another drought cycle will depend largely on how much rain and snow falls during February and March. 
Further east, the amount of snow on the ground is also far below average across the Colorado River Basin, where a 17-year run of mostly dry years has left reservoirs at alarmingly low levels."
flood,"Heavy rain may bring more floods to Louisiana, Texas; 5 dead Heavy rain across the eastern Texas and western Louisiana Gulf Coasts may bring more flooding on Friday, the National Weather Service said, with rainfall-related deaths rising to five in Louisiana.  Of the five deaths, four involved people driving into high water, Lousiana Governor John Bel Edwards said, according to NBC News."
other,"The Central Bank¡¯s monetary policy decisions are made to maintain a low and stable inflation rate over time, which is an indication of price stability.Inflation is a general increase in price levels over time. It is based on the prices of various consumer goods and services, which are evaluated and statistically represented in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The month-on-month (or year-on-year) inflation rate is determined by comparing the CPI for a particular month to the CPI of that same month in the previous year.Inflation is caused by numerous factors, both locally and internationally. For example, during periods of drought or excessive rain, the prices of food could increase, leading to an increase in the inflation rate. International factors like increases or decreases in oil prices can also lead to changes in inflation reflecting movements in energy and transport costs. Depreciation in the exchange rate against the major currencies can also cause inflation since Kenya is a net importer of goods. Inflation can also be caused by factors that influence the demand for goods and services, like the amount of money ordinary people have available to spend.High levels of inflation inhibit economic growth and cause the Kenya Shilling to lose value compared to international currencies,  thereby discouraging the purchase of Kenyan goods and services. It also makes it difficult for people to make long-term financial decisions, as they cannot be sure about the future value of their investments and savings. If there is a general decrease of prices over time due to a collapse in demand or increased supply of goods and services, then there is deflation. Deflation inhibits economic growth by reducing profit and lowering investor incentives."
other,"Global financial markets began the year on a calmer note after a turbulent December. Among AEs, equity markets in the US recovered from a sharp sell-off in December, triggered by monetary policy tightening by the Fed, trade tensions and an impending shutdown. EM stock markets, which declined in December on a slew of soft economic data, registered some gains recently on expectations of accommodative monetary policy stances in major economies. The 10-year yield in the US, which fell to a multi-month low in December, rose in January on the edging up of crude oil prices and positive risk sentiment, though softening of the Fed stance restricted the gains. Among other AEs, bond yields in the Euro area and Japan eased on diminishing optimism about global growth. In most EMEs, bond yields have eased as well. In currency markets, the US dollar remained under pressure, though expectations of easing trade tensions provided some support. EME currencies appreciated on the pause in the rate hiking cycle by the Fed and expectations of a positive outcome from US-China trade negotiations.Moving on to the domestic economy, on January 7, 2019 the Central Statistics Office (CSO) released the first advance estimates (FAE) for 2018-19, placing India¡¯s real gross domestic product (GDP) growth at 7.2 per cent _ the same level as in 2017-18 (first revised estimates). The FAE for 2018-19 featured an acceleration in gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) and a slowdown in consumption expenditure (both private and government). The drag from net exports is estimated to decline in 2018-19.Some indicators of investment demand, viz., production and imports of capital goods, contracted in November/December. Credit flows to industry remain muted. Available data suggest that while revenue expenditure of the Centre, excluding interest payments and subsidies, contracted in Q3, that of States increased sharply, thus maintaining overall growth in government spending."
other,"The classical gold standard period was an era where central banks either did not exist or had much less discretion, where prices were more flexible, and where the public did not expect governments to provide modern social services. These conditions simply do not exist today.In at least some respects, central banks are already taking steps toward a more rules-based monetary system. Beginning in the 1990s, many began targeting 2 percent inflation, and inflation since then has generally been low across the developed world (the recent uptick notwithstanding). Last year, the Fed modified this goal by targeting 2 percent inflation on average over time, which means making up for past misses of the target.An even better goal would be to target total dollar spending in the economy, or nominal gross domestic product. Among the differences in this approach is that it allows inflation to rise temporarily in response to recessions. This reduces the severity of debt burdens and stimulates the economy¡¯s recovery. It also allows inflation to fall during economic booms, helping consumers. Moreover, nominal gross domestic product targeting can be rules-based, making policy more predictable and constrained."
earthquake,"An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.9 has shaken southern Peru, leaving nearly two dozen people injured.
The U.S. Geological Survey says Friday's quake was centered 52 kilometers from the coastal city of Ica and was registered at a depth of 15 kilometers.
The Reuters news agency reports the quake shook buildings in Peru's capital, Lima. Officials in Ica say 20 people have been treated at the hospital. Their injuries have been described as non life-threatening.
In 2007, a massive 8.0-magnitude earthquake along Peru's central coast killed at least 540 people and left thousands homeless.  Peru lies near the boundary of two tectonic plates, making the region vulnerable to earthquakes."
other,"The Singapore economy should expand at a moderate pace in the quarters ahead.  Wage inflation is likely to remain relatively firm, and businesses in food-related and some services sectors could further pass on cost increases.  Consequently, MAS Core Inflation is projected to stay above its historical average over the next few quarters even as CPI-All Items inflation remains subdued.MAS will therefore maintain its policy of a modest and gradual appreciation of the S$NEER policy band.  There will be no change to the slope and width of the policy band, and the level at which it is centred.  This policy stance is assessed to be appropriate for containing domestic and imported sources of inflationary pressures, and ensuring that inflation expectations remain well anchored.  MAS will continue to closely monitor the impact of external developments and domestic restructuring on the growth and inflation prospects for Singapore.

Typhoon,"MANILA — Super Typhoon Goni, the world's most powerful storm in four years, crashed through the Philippines on Sunday, smashing buildings, toppling trees, and causing floods and mudslides. At least 10 people were reported dead as of Monday morning.
Peak winds were estimated at 195 mph early Sunday before Goni slammed into Catanduanes Island, home to more than 260,000 people. Those winds, equivalent to those of a strong Category 5 hurricane, made the storm comparable to Super Typhoon Haiyan, the catastrophic cyclone that devastated Tacloban City in the Philippines in 2013 and killed more than 6,000 people. The winds were similar to those of Typhoon Meranti, which struck the Philippines in 2016.
Goni landed in a country already reeling from two typhoons in the past two weeks, the coronavirus pandemic, a recession and a record unemployment rate this year."
Typhoon,"Louisiana on Sunday was picking up the pieces after Hurricane Delta swept through, wreaking havoc on a region already devastated by Hurricane Laura six weeks ago.
Two people were confirmed on Sunday to have been killed after Delta made landfall on Friday evening near the coastal town of Creole, with top winds of 100mph. 
Delta on Friday and Saturday moved over Lake Charles, a city where Hurricane Laura damaged nearly every home and building in late August.
Aerial photographs showed the destruction around Creole, with roofs torn from buildings and communities surrounded by floodwater.
John Bel Edwards, the governor of Louisiana, said the storm dumped more than 15 inches of rain on Lake Charles over two days, and more than 10 inches on Baton Rouge.
Edwards said 3,000 Louisiana National Guard soldiers were called up to clear roads and distribute meals and tarps.
An estimated 380,000 people were left without power on Sunday.
Delta rapidly weakened once it moved onto land and slowed to a tropical depression on Saturday."
other,"Thus far this year, labor market conditions have improved further, while consumer price inflation has run below the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) longer-run objective of 2 percent. Gains in payroll employment since the start of the year have averaged about 200,000 jobs per month, and various measures of underutilization in labor markets have continued to trend down. Even so, the unemployment rate, at 7-1/2 percent in June, was still well above levels prevailing prior to the recent recession and well above the levels that FOMC participants think can be sustained in the longer term consistent with price stability."
other,"Headline inflation is projected to remain soft in the near term reflecting the current low level of inflation and the benign food inflation outlook. Beyond the near term, some uncertainties warrant careful monitoring. First, vegetable prices have been volatile in the recent period; reversal in vegetable prices could impart upside risk to the food inflation trajectory. Secondly, the oil price outlook continues to be hazy. Thirdly, a further heightening of trade tensions and geo-political uncertainties could also weigh on global growth prospects, dampening global demand and softening global commodity prices, especially oil prices. Fourthly, the unusual spike in the prices of health and education needs to be closely watched. Fifthly, financial markets remain volatile. Sixthly, the monsoon outcome is assumed to be normal; any spatial or temporal variation in rainfall may alter the food inflation outlook. Finally, several proposals in the union budget for 2019-20 are likely to boost aggregate demand by raising disposable incomes, but the full effect of some of the measures is likely to materialise over a period of time.The MPC notes that the output gap has opened up modestly as actual output has inched lower than potential. Investment activity is recovering but supported mainly by public spending on infrastructure. The need is to strengthen private investment activity and buttress private consumption.Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to change the stance of monetary policy from calibrated tightening to neutral and to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 basis points.The decision to change the monetary policy stance was unanimous. As regards the reduction in the policy repo rate, Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, Dr. Pami Dua, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted in favour of the decision. Dr. Chetan Ghate and Dr. Viral V. Acharya voted to keep the policy rate unchanged. The MPC reiterates its commitment to achieving the medium-term target for headline inflation of 4 per cent on a durable basis. The minutes of the MPC¡¯s meeting will be published by February 21, 2019.The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled from April 2 to 4, 2019."
other,"There are several aspects which we should consider as investors, with regards to monetary policy. The first is interest rate policy: this is what central banks set as their ¡®base rate¡¯, so in the UK it is called the ¡®bank rate¡¯, and in the US it¡¯s called the ¡®federal funds rate¡¯. Each economy around the world has a base rate that is set by the central bank. There are also several other associated rates, for example a refinancing rate or a deposit rate, that go along with that base monetary policy rate, but in the market and the media usually just the base rate rate is focused upon as the central banks¡¯ primary monetary policy interest rate tool.The next tool is the reserve requirement ratio. This ¡®RRR, as it is often called, is a level at which banks need to keep money on reserve with the central bank in order to lend. The higher that RRR is, the tighter the monetary policy situation is, because banks will have to keep more money on reserve rather than lending that very money out into the economy."
other,"Manufacturing firms polled in the Reserve Bank¡¯s industrial outlook survey (March 2018) expected higher input price pressures in Q1:2018-19 due to rising cost of raw materials (higher negative values for cost of raw materials indicate higher input price pressures) (Chart I.4).2 Selling prices are also expected to increase, but not sufficient to protect profit margins. The Nikkei¡¯s purchasing managers¡¯ survey also indicates both input and output price pressures for manufacturing (March 2018) as well as services (February 2018) sectors.Professional forecasters surveyed by the Reserve Bank in March 2018 expect CPI inflation to firm up to 5.1 per cent in Q1:2018-19 and moderate thereafter to 4.3 per cent in Q4:2018-19 (Chart I.5).3 Their medium-term inflation expectations (5 years ahead) remained unchanged at 4.5 per cent, while longer-term inflation expectations (10 years ahead) increased by 40 bps to 4.5 per cent.Taking into account the initial conditions, signals from the forward looking surveys and estimates from structural and other models, CPI inflation is projected to pick up from 4.4 per cent in February 2018 to 5.1 per cent in Q1:2018-19 due to unfavourable base effects and then moderate to 4.7 per cent in Q2, and 4.4 per cent in Q3 and Q4, with risks tilted to the upside (Chart I.6). It may be noted that the direct impact of the increase in the HRA announced by the Central Government fades away fully by December 2018. The 50 per cent and the 70 per cent confidence intervals for inflation in Q4:2018-19 are 3.2-5.9 per cent and 2.5-6.7 per cent, respectively. Excluding the estimated impact of HRA for central government employees, CPI inflation would pick up from 4.1 per cent in February 2018 to 4.7 per cent in Q1:2018-19 and then moderate to 4.4 per cent in Q2, Q3 and Q4.For 2019-20, assuming a normal monsoon and no major exogenous/policy shocks, structural model estimates indicate that inflation will move in a range of 4.5-4.6 per cent. The 50 per cent and the 70 per cent confidence intervals for Q4:2019-20 are 3.0-6.1 per cent and 2.2-7.0 per cent, respectively.There are a number of upside risks to the baseline forecasts. Although the direct impact on headline inflation is statistical and should be looked through for policy purposes, second order effects of the expected increases in HRA, including by state governments, can impact inflation expectations. Other major risks to the inflation outlook are crude oil and other commodity prices, the proposed revisions to MSPs for kharif crops, and fiscal slippage at both the central and state levels."
wildfires,"Forest fires in Algeria killed 42 people on Tuesday, including 25 soldiers deployed to help put out the blaze, the government said, as thick clouds of smoke covered much of the mountainous Kabylie region east of the capital.
Dozens of separate fires have raged through forest areas across northern Algeria since Monday night and Interior Minister Kamel Beldjoud accused arsonists of igniting the flames, without providing more details on the allegations. “Only criminal hands can be behind the simultaneous outbreak of about 50 fires across several localities,” he said.
Last week, a European Union atmosphere monitor said the Mediterranean had become a wildfire hotspot as massive blazes engulfed forests in Turkey and Greece, aided by a heatwave. Residents of the Tizi Ouzou region in Kabylie used tree branches to try to smother burning patches of forest or hurled water from plastic containers in a desperate effort to douse the fire.
The soldiers were killed in different areas, some while trying to extinguish the flames and others after they were cut off by the spreading fire, Kabylie residents said. The Defence Ministry said more soldiers had been badly injured with burns.
Several houses were burnt as families were escaping to hotels, youth hostels and university residences, witnesses said, adding that a dense smoke hampered the visibility of fire crews."

other,"The U.S. economy continued to expand at a solid pace over the first half of 2005 despite the restraint imposed on aggregate demand by a further rise in crude oil prices. Household spending trended up, propelled by rising wealth and income and by low interest rates, and business outlays received ongoing support from favorable financial conditions, rising sales, and increased profitability. Moreover, the earlier declines in the foreign exchange value of the dollar shifted some domestic and foreign demand toward U.S. producers. Overall, the economic expansion was sufficient to create jobs at roughly the same pace as in late 2004 and to lower the unemployment rate further over the first half of this year."

drought,"California’s megadrought is stretching into its fifth year, and as the best hope for rain, El Niño, fizzles, the outlook is grim. While Northern California's winter precipitation approached normal, 60 percent of the state remains in a severe drought.
So a new discovery under the Central Valley has residents excited; researchers from Stanford mapped out a deep groundwater reservoir under the Valley that holds three times more water than previously thought. They recently published their results in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
“It's not often that you find a ‘water windfall,’ but we just did,"" study co-author Robert Jackson says in a press release. “There's far more fresh water and usable water than we expected.”
Ria Misra at Gizmodo reports that the researchers estimate the reservoir holds 2,700 cubic kilometers of water or approximately 713 trillion liquid gallons. That’s more than Lake Erie and Lake Ontario combined.
The researchers analyzed data from more than 360 oil and gas fields in an eight-county area. Previous studies were based on estimates of water down to 1,000 feet below the surface. But the new study examines the water volume down to about 3,000 feet.
Despite the depth, Jackson tells Misra that the water is still retrievable. But the big question now is whether people should actually go after it. Pumping for groundwater can cause big changes to an area. Extracting during the drought has already led to subsidence in the Central Valley, which is sinking several inches per year, according to Dale Kasler, Ryan Sabalow and Phillip Reese at The Sacramento Bee. One area near Corcoran sank 13 inches in eight months. The sinking soil threatens the elaborate system of canals, pipes and bridges that transport water through the valley."
drought,"Folsom Lake, one of California's largest reservoirs, is crucial to providing water to the state's 40 million-plus residents.
But this year, relentless heat and dry conditions have evaporated the already below-average snowpack on the nearby Sierra Nevada Mountains that supply the reservoir, bringing the lake's water levels to previously unseen lows.
Speaking to ABC News' Zohreen Shah on what should be the lake's floor, Rich Preston-Lemay, the sector superintendent for Folsom Lake Park, said that under normal conditions, where they were standing would be 70 feet underwater.
""The water that we're on right now is used for a variety of things, from drinking water for some of the local municipalities [to] ... downstream on the American River for the fisheries habitat, and then for other water consumers downstream for farming, agricultural purposes,"" said Preston-Lemay, who's overseen the lake for nearly 20 years.
Worsening drought is currently affecting all of California, threatening cascading issues from farmers' yields to the state's hydroelectric power plants, which could then cause rolling blackouts statewide and wildfires that displace entire communities.
California Natural Resources Secretary Wade Crowfoot said the drought is caused by climate change, and that it's no longer a phenomenon they are solely trying to preempt.
""We recognize that we are in a race against time to protect our communities and our natural places from the effects of climate change,"" he said."
Typhoon,"Michele Vincent’s home was largely intact in spite of hurricanes Laura and Delta But tears streamed down her face as she looked at her church’s broken windows and shattered pews.
“It’s hard to come back and see it again and then to know there’s another (hurricane) that’s out there,” Vincent, of Cameron told The Advertiser of Lafayette. “It’s tough.”
She said people leave with every hurricane that batters Louisiana's lightly populated southwest coast.
“Yeah, our house is still there, but do you know how lonely this place is going to be?” she said.
Coastal Cameron Parish had about 9,800 residents when Hurricane Rita hit in 2005. The next census, in 2010, found about 6,800 people in the parish, Louisiana's equivalent of a county elsewhere.
“I don’t know what’ll happen now, with these two storms,” said Scott Trahan, vice president of the parish police jury.
Hurricane Laura made landfall in Cameron on Aug. 27 and Delta came in Friday near Creole, just 13 miles (21 kilometers) to the east, where Trahan lives.
“Everywhere you look it's destruction around here,” he said in a phone interview Monday with The Associated Press. “Leave Cameron Parish and go into Calcasieu it's bad there too. You can run from the water but you can't run from the winds.”
The Army Corps of Engineers said Monday that it is still installing tarps on homes damaged by Hurricane Laura, and will check on and replace if needed those already installed and then hit by Delta in Allen, Beauregard, Calcasieu, Cameron, Jefferson Davis and Vernon parishes. “ALL eligible homeowners within the six affected parishes are eligible to sign-up for a FREE temporary roof ... through Oct. 24,” a news release said.

other,"About a year ago, in December 2015, the FOMC raised the target range for the federal funds rate after holding the range at near zero since late 2008 to support economic activity and stem disinflationary pressures in the wake of the Great Recession. At that time, the Committee judged that it had seen sufficient improvement in the labor market and was reasonably confident that inflation would move back to its 2 percent objective, which would warrant an initial increase in the federal funds rate. Through most of 2016, the Committee maintained the target range of 1/4 to 1/2 percent, pending further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives. In December, in view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the FOMC raised the target range for the federal funds rate another 1/4 percentage point, to a range of 1/2 to 3/4 percent (figure 43).3 The Committee kept that same target range at its most recent meeting, which concluded on February 1."
other,"In its bi-monthly monetary policy statement of February 2, 2016, the Reserve Bank indicated that it awaits further data on inflation as well as on structural reforms in the Union Budget that boost growth while controlling spending. Given recent data, forecasts in Chart 1 indicate that inflation will trend towards the 5 per cent target in March 2017 under reasonable assumptions. The changes to the RBI Act to create a Monetary Policy Committee will further strengthen monetary policy credibility. In the Union Budget for 2016-17, the Government has adhered to the path of fiscal consolidation and this will support the disinflation process going forward. The Government has also set out a comprehensive strategy for reinvigorating demand in the rural economy, enhancing the economy¡¯s social and physical infrastructure, and improving the environment for doing business and deepening institutional reform. The implementation of these measures should improve supply conditions and allow efficiency and productivity gains to accrue. Given weak private investment in the face of low capacity utilisation, a reduction in the policy rate by 25 bps will help strengthen activity and aid the Government¡¯s initiatives.Perhaps more important at this juncture is to ensure that current and past policy rate cuts transmit to lending rates. The reduction in small savings rates announced in March 2016, the substantial refinements in the liquidity management framework announced in this policy review and the introduction of the marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) should improve transmission and magnify the effects of the current policy rate cut. The stance of monetary policy will remain accommodative. The Reserve Bank will continue to watch macroeconomic and financial developments in the months ahead with a view to responding with further policy action as space opens up."
earthquake,"Alaska Earthquake Revised up to Magnitude-7.6 JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — The magnitude of the earthquake that struck off the Alaska Peninsula and produced a tsunami with small waves was revised up to 7.6, officials said Tuesday. The quake Monday was first reported as magnitude-7.4 and was revised to a 7.5 before the latest revision. There was no major damage from the quake or tsunami. Don Blakeman, a geophysicist with the National Earthquake Information Center, said magnitudes are calculated using various mathematical formulas. He said revisions can occur as agencies contribute information or add more analysis. Different agencies also can report varying distances from the quake to nearby communities because earthquakes occur over a wide geographic area, said Michael West, director of the Alaska Earthquake Center. The quake struck in the Pacific Ocean, centered about 67 miles (118 kilometers) southeast of Sand Point, according to the Alaska Earthquake Center. Sand Point is about 800 miles (1,288 km) southwest of Anchorage. The earthquake was felt widely in communities along the southern coast, including Sand Point, Chignik, Unalaska and the Kenai Peninsula, according to the center. The quake produced a tsunami, and a warning was issued for about a thousand-mile stretch of the southern Alaska coast. The warning downgraded to an advisory just over two hours after the earthquake struck, and the advisory was lifted late Monday. Waves topped 2 feet (1 meter) in some areas, according to the National Tsunami Warning Center."

The storm brought sustained winds of 60mph and dropped more than 12 inches of rain, according to the National Hurricane Centre. It made landfall on Padre Island, south of Corpus Christi.
At least three 18-wheeler trucks and several other vehicles were overturned, shutting down a two-mile stretch of US Route 77 in Sarita, close to the Mexican border.
More than 283,000 homes and businesses were without power at one point.
Coastal states have been working to adjust their emergency plans to take account of the coronavirus.
Texas governor Greg Abbott said on Saturday that some people in need of shelter would be given hotel rooms to help maintain social distancing from others.
As the storm swept in he said that the Federal Emergency Management Agency had approved an emergency declaration that will provide federal aid."
wildfires,"A swathe of land is affected on either side of the main road from Figueres to La Jonquera, south of the Pyrenees.
A Frenchman aged 64, who suffered severe burns, died on Monday.
Earlier two French nationals drowned in the sea near the border with France while trying to escape the flames. A 75-year-old man, also French, died from a heart attack in Llers, near Figueres.
Smoke from the fires has reached parts of Barcelona, Spanish media report.
About 20 people have been injured fleeing the blazes, while hundreds of firefighters have been deployed, struggling as 90km/h (56mph) gusts of wind fan the flames.
A forest fire is also raging in the parched Caceres region of southwestern Spain, again fuelled by strong gusts of wind. Spanish media say seven helicopters and two planes are trying to douse the flames with water, on a front two to three kilometres (1.5 miles) wide.
About 50 people have been evacuated from the village of Cambron in the affected area, which is mostly wild pine forest.
In Catalonia about 1,300 people left their homes in Alt Emporda district and spent the night in sports halls and social clubs."
valcano eruption,"Why did White Island erupt? The White Island volcano was a ""disaster waiting to happen,"" and tour groups never should have been allowed on the island, a leading volcano expert says. The New Zealand volcano, also known as Whakaari, erupted about 2.10pm (12.10 AEDT) on Monday, spewing plumes of ash 3600 metres into the air. Five people died in the eruption, including three Australians. 11 people are still missing, and 31 people are in hospital _ many in a critical condition. White Island is New Zealand’s most active cone - or stratovolcano. It has erupted several times since 2012, and was in continuous eruption between 1975 and 2000. An eruption in 1914 claimed 12 lives. ""White Island has been a disaster waiting to happen for many years,"" said Professor Ray Cas, a volcano expert at Monash University."
earthquake,"At least 31 people have been killed and more than 1,600 injured in a powerful earthquake in eastern Turkey.
The magnitude-6.8 quake centred on the town of Sivrice in Elazig province caused buildings to collapse and sent residents rushing into the street.
Forty-five people have been rescued so far, with more than 20 feared to remain trapped, officials say.
Earthquakes are common in Turkey - about 17,000 people died in a quake in the western city of Izmit in 1999.
Friday's quake struck at about 20:55 local time (17:55 GMT).
Tremors were also felt in neighbouring Syria, Lebanon and Iran.
More than 400 aftershocks were recorded, Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (Afad) said.
Rescue teams worked through the night, using their hands, drills and diggers to try to find people in the rubble of fallen buildings. They also brought beds and tents for those displaced, and warned residents against returning to damaged buildings because of the danger of aftershocks.
Afad said that most of the casualties were in Elazig province, and deaths were also reported in the neighbouring province of Malatya.
Some 1,607 people were injured by the earthquake, according to the latest count."
Typhoon,"Chinese state media report that the death toll in the northeast of the country has risen to 37 since floods began on August 10.
Liaoning province reported 12 flood-related deaths after downpours on Friday and Saturday, 14 were killed in Jilin province, and officials in Heilongjiang province said 11 had died, according to the official Xinhua news agency.
Xinhua reported that the flooding in the area was the worst in several decades, displacing some 140,000 people and destroying more than 2,500 houses. Railways and highways were cut off and bridges damaged.
Losses have been put at 7.13 billion yuan ($1.17 billion, 874 million euros).
Meanwhile, Southern China is recovering after being battered by Typhoon Utor last week. Xinhua said 10 people were dead and four others missing in the southern province of Guangdong and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
Flood of the century
Across the border in Russia, flooding has also caused widespread devastation in the country's far east, though no casualties have been reported so far.
The floods have been declared a natural disaster in the worst-affected regions of Amur and Khabarovsk. Authorities say the floods are the worst in more than a century.
Tens of thousands of emergency services workers and civilians have been struggling to contain the waters of the Amur River on Russia's border with China. The minister of Regional development, Viktor Ishayev, said more than 17,000 people had been evacuated and that this figure could rise to as many as 100,000.
""The damage is extensive, but the most significant achievement is there have been no casualties ... we cannot relax, there is still a lot of work to be done,"" Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a televised address on Saturday.
The Interfax news agency reported that Prime Minister Dimitry Medvedev had earmarked 3.2 billion rubles (73 million euros, $97 million) for the affected regions, though the bill for damage is expected to be much higher.
The flooding occurred after massive rains since the end of July caused the Amur River, and one of its tributaries, the Zeya, to burst their banks."
drought,"The Oroville Reservoir reached a record low level of 195.66 m (641.93 feet) above mean sea level on August 5, 2021, forcing authorities in California to shut down their second-largest hydroelectric plant. 
This is now the lowest level since the nation's tallest dam was completed in 1967 and the first time the hydroelectric plant was shut down due to lack of water. 
The old record was 196.59 m (645 feet) set in 1977.
The California Department of Water Resources (DWR) State Water Project operations managers have taken the Hyatt Powerplant at Lake Oroville offline due to falling lake levels, California DWR Director Karla Nemeth said in a statement.
""This is the first time Hyatt Powerplant has gone offline as a result of low lake levels.""
""However, DWR anticipated this moment, and the state has planned for its loss in both water and grid management.

Families have been affected in 10 districts and many have been evacuated to 104 safety shelters.  The National Building Research Organization has issued a landslide warning for several districts and has requested people living in high-risk areas to move to safer areas. A family of four died when a heavy mound of earth crashed into their house.  Many parish priests prepared meals for flood and landslide victims in accordance with health rules and regulations due to the Covid-19 situation.  Father Jayantha Nimal, parish priest of St. Nicholas Church in Bopitiya, has visited victims' houses amid torrential rain and the threat of more floods."
wildfires,"Wildfires have burned more than 3 million acres in Texas since the fire season started, more than any other year since the Texas Forest Service began keeping records.
The fire season officially began Nov. 15, said Forest Service Spokeswoman April Saginor.
Officials have reported 12,362 fires to the agency this season, Saginor said. Texas’ annual budget for fighting wildfires is $15.5 million. As of Sunday, the state had spent $126.7 million, Saginor said.
“This is an unusual year for us,” Saginor said. “We’ve surpassed 3 million acres. This is the first time that’s happened since we’ve kept records.”
Three million acres is more than twice the size of Delaware. The Texas Forest Service has kept records of acres burned since 1985.
Three fires scorched Texas Panhandle areas Sunday. The fast-moving Nance Ranch fire in east of Canyon consumed about 590 acres, Forest Service spokesman Jerry Rohnert said.
Randall County authorities issued a voluntary evacuation order during the blaze. Rohnert said residents of about 20 homes evacuated. All had been allowed to return to their homes Monday.
″(Firefighters) were careful letting people back because there’s a lot of straw and cow manure there,” he said. “That stuff burns for a long time.”
Three firefighters suffered minor injuries battling the blaze. Paramedics treated two for heat exhaustion and a third for minor cuts after a window in his vehicle shattered during the fire, authorities said. None required hospitalization."
wildfires,"Fires continue to rage at high levels through the Amazon in Brazil for the second consecutive year, raising concerns among scientists that the rainforest's destruction could eventually reach a point of no return.
Since Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro took office, governmental measures to curb illegal fires have shown little impact, as flames and deforestation erase vast swathes of the world's biggest rainforest.
Most fires in the Amazon are set by land-grabbers and wildcat ranchers, seeking to transform parts of the rainforest into their own lucrative agricultural enterprises. And this August was a particularly bad time for such fires: Preliminary data collected by the National Spatial Research Institute (INPE) show 29,307 fires in the Brazilian Amazon last month.
However, due to a technical issue with the NASA satellite tracking fires, experts say that figure could be even higher. The final tally of fires recorded in August is expected to rise 2% above the August 2019 total, says Albert Setzer, INPE's senior scientist -- which would make this August the worst in 10 years.
The more fires there are, the faster the rainforest is transformed into grasslands for illicit cattle and soy-growing operations. According to research from NGO MapBiomas, which tracks land use in Brazil, 95% of the deforested area in Brazil in 2019 wasn't authorized. ""Most of (the fires) are illegal,"" said Tasso Azevedo, a former head of Brazil's forest service and coordinator of MapBiomas.
Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon biome reached 1,830 square miles, an area bigger than Rhode Island state, in the period from January to July 2020,. August figures for deforestation are yet to be released."
drought,"More than 330 000 people in rural areas of southern and eastern China are facing a drinking water shortage due to drought affecting the region since October 2020, the government said. About 2.4 million people had already been impacted by the dry spell, and concerns are growing in other areas such as Guangxi, Hunan, and Yunnan.
More than 500 000 ha (1.2 million acres) of arable land had been hit by the drought, leaving more than 330 000 people without enough supply of drinking water, the Ministry of Water Resources said Thursday, February 4, 2021.
Since October last year, rainfall in southern regions of the Yangtze River had been 50 to 80 percent lower than normal.
So far, around 2.4 million people had already been affected by the drought in the provinces of Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Fujian. Meanwhile, concerns are growing in Guangxi, Hunan, and Yunnan, the ministry added.
In Taizhou in Zhejiang, residents of Snament county have been reeling from their worst dry spell in 50 years, state broadcaster CCTV reported.
Authorities have ordered the water supply to residents' homes to be turned off on alternate days, and non-essential businesses that consume large quantities of water were ordered to cancel their operations. In rural areas, drinking water is delivered to people by fire engines.
According to Yuan Yuan, deputy director of the China Meteorological Administration’s forecasting office, the drought was mostly caused by La Nina.
""The abnormal cyclone circulation has continued since October, and its intensity increased this winter.""
Qian Yonglan, a senior researcher at the National Meteorological Center, said the dry spell had already impacted winter crops, and if rainfall continues to be low, rice seeding and planting may also be affected.
""However, as early rice has not yet been planted on a large scale, the impact so far has been limited.""
The Zhejiang government is yet to release figures on the drought's effect on agricultural production but said that the lack of rain is likely to last until April."

Inflation expectations also adapt to actual inflation outcomes of salient items such as food and fuel. Inflation expectations of urban households surveyed by the Reserve Bank exhibited a mixed picture in its September 2018 round2: they increased by 50 bps over the previous round for the three months ahead horizon and softened by 30 bps for the one year ahead horizon. The proportion of respondents expecting the general price level to increase by more than the current rate, however, declined marginally in the September round for the three months ahead horizon and was almost unchanged for the one year ahead horizon (Chart I.3).Manufacturing firms polled in the July-September 2018 round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s industrial outlook survey expected higher cost of raw materials in Q3:2018-19 (Chart I.4).3 Consequently, respondents anticipated input prices to firm up further and muted profit margins in spite of higher selling prices.

Typhoon,"Hurricane Hanna Did Not Knock Over U.S.-Mexico Border Wall A video purporting to show footage of Hurricane Hanna toppling the U.S.-Mexico border wall in Rio Grande Valley was actually taken at a construction site in June, according to officials, refuting people who took to social media to criticize Trump's wall for shoddy construction. “U.S. Customs and Border Protection is not aware of any border wall panels falling over due to Hurricane Hanna hitting the Rio Grande Valley Sector this past weekend,” the agency told Forbes on Monday. CBP says the video was actually taken at a Department of Defense construction site in New Mexico in June. The video reportedly showed people in hard hats viewing a section of the wall that had been damaged by wind, with the caption: “‘Hanna’ knocked down part of the border wall that is being built between the United States and Mexico,"" according to Caller Times. The video, posted by journalist Yadith Valdez, has since been deleted. People on Twitter expressed outrage at the footage, believing Hanna had toppled the wall:"

wildfires,"The lights were back on Friday for many of the nearly 2 million Northern California residents who lost electricity when the state's largest utility switched it off this week in an effort to prevent wildfires, as the first death linked to the outages was reported a man who relied on oxygen.
The threat of widespread outages loomed in Southern California after the winds moved to the Los Angeles area, where a wildfire fueled by strong Santa Ana winds prompted officials to order the evacuation of 100,000 people from their homes in the foothills of the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles County.
In that fire, one man went into cardiac arrest and died at the scene.
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. restored power in Northern California after workers inspected power lines to make sure it was safe to do so. The winds had increased the possibility of transmission lines toppling to the ground and starting wildfires.
The utility said 543,000 Northern California businesses and residences got their power back but that nearly 195,000 customers were still in the dark. More than half of those who lost power in the San Francisco Bay Area had it again on Friday.
The city itself was not subject to the preventive outages. Experts have said there are between two and three people for every electrical customer.
El Dorado County officials on Friday said a man dependent on oxygen died about 12 minutes after PG&E cut off power this week. Marie Aldea of Pollock Pines said her 67-year-old father Robert Mardis Sr. was asleep when the electricity went out around 3.30 am Wednesday and likely couldn't wake up in time to get his back up machine, which ran on battery.
""We were all asleep, we heard my mom scream. She was crying,"" she told KTXL-TV in Sacramento .
""My dad went down in her arms, he was going for this oxygen machine."" Aldea said her father's health was poor, but she doesn't understand why the utility turned off the power.
""No winds at all. And because of that, my father is gone,"" she said.
PG&E spokesman Jeff Smith said the utility has not been able to confirm the report.
""It's devastating beyond words,"" said Gov. Gavin Newsom. ""Losing a family member is horrific and to the extent this was the reason why I hope that is investigated and I hope those responsible are held to account."" The death was first reported by the Mountain Democrat in Placerville."
other,"In July this year, MAS re-centred the exchange rate policy band at the prevailing level of the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER).  The zero percent appreciation path and the width of the band were maintained.  The level of the S$NEER was assessed to be conducive to supporting the incipient recovery in the Singapore economy, and maintaining domestic price stability in a low inflation environment, particularly in view of possible downside risks to the outlook for this year.The S$NEER strengthened through much of July and August, as negative sentiments towards the regional SARS-hit countries lifted.  (Chart 1.)    The S$ continued to appreciate against the US$ in September but it was outpaced by the Yen and the Euro, and as a result, the S$NEER eased back towards the centre of the policy band.  This trend continued after the G7 communiqu¨¦ on 20 September.Overall monetary conditions remained easy over the past three months, despite the slight increase in domestic interest rates.  The three-month domestic interbank rate edged up to 0.81% at end-September, compared to 0.63% at end-June, on the back of a sharp rise in long-term bond yields.  However, retail interest rates have remained stable."
wildfires,"Crews were digging in and burning out fire lines amid another round of high winds that contributed to the fury of a Northern California wildfire.
""We have a firefight ahead of us and the wind today is going to make it very challenging,"" said Keith Wade, a spokesman with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, on Saturday.
The Caldor Fire in the northern Sierra Nevada already destroyed dozens of homes, and authorities on Friday closed down a 46-mile stretch of U.S. Route 50, the main route between the state capital of Sacramento and Lake Tahoe on the Nevada state line.
The highway was closed after debris from the blaze fell onto the roadway and because of red flag warnings for 20- to 30-mph winds that by Saturday evening ""combined with continued extremely dry fuels will result in critical fire weather conditions in the vicinity of the Caldor Fire,"" the National Weather Service said.
The winds could gust to 40 mph Saturday.
The road is a key checkpoint as crews struggle against the fire, which erupted earlier this week and grew to 10 times its size in a few days, fueled by winds.
""We're going to invest everything we can into holding the fire south"" of the road, said Eric Schwab, an operations section chief with Cal Fire. 
Firefighters made progress on the fire's western side and burned vegetation to starve it of fuel and prevent the flames from heading into the evacuated community of Pollock Pines. On the northeast side, crews were protecting cabins in the dense forest area, fire officials said.
The Caldor Fire had now devoured about 130 square miles as of Saturday and more than 1,500 firefighters were battling it amid heavy timber and rugged terrain.
The blaze was one of about a dozen large California wildfires that have scorched Northern California, incinerating at least 700 homes alone in and around the Sierra Nevada communities of Greenville and Grizzly Flats. 
Thousands of homes remained under threat in communities tucked away in scenic forests and tens of thousands of people remain under evacuation orders. 
Nine national forests in the region have been closed because of the fire threat.
To the northwest of the Caldor Fire, the massive Dixie Fire kept expanding and new evacuations were ordered, including the tiny hamlet of Taylorsville. In five weeks, the fire about 175 miles northeast of San Francisco has become the second-largest in state history and blackened an area twice the size of Los Angeles."

flood,"Death toll rises as monsoon floods hit Bhutan, Nepal THIMPU, Bhutan: At least a dozen people have been killed in Bhutan and Nepal and several others are missing as torrential monsoon rains hit the region, triggering landslides and inundating homes, officials said on Thursday.  The annual monsoon season is crucial to replenish water supplies across South Asia, but it also causes death and destruction. Ten collectors of cordyceps -- a fungus valued for its alleged aphrodisiac properties -- died when their remote mountain camp north of Bhutan’s capital Thimpu was washed away early Wednesday.  Five others were injured and were in a stable condition in hospital, officials said. Bhutan’s Prime Minister Lotay Tshering offered his prayers and condolences and said a rescue team had been sent to the site.  ""I urge everyone across the country to avoid visiting or camping by the riverside, and to be cautious of such possible mishaps during (the) monsoon,"" he added in a message on Facebook."
other,"The recovery in the global economy is continuing, although conditions clearly differ across regions. Growth remains solid in most of Asia, although below the rapid pace seen earlier this year. Strong growth is also continuing in parts of Latin America. In contrast, in many of the advanced economies, consumption remains subdued and the earlier boost to activity from the dynamics of the inventory cycle is waning, as are the effects of the earlier fiscal expansions.In China and in most of east Asia, growth looks to have returned to a sustainable pace and concerns about the possibility of a larger-than-expected slowing have lessened recently. Growth also remains strong in India. In many countries in the region, the authorities have begun the process of tightening policy, although real interest rates remain low. In several countries, housing markets have been strong over the past year, which has prompted a tightening of prudential requirements and other measures to cool these markets. Inflation in the region has also increased, although this largely reflects a rise in food prices. In a number of countries, policy-makers remain concerned about the possibility of a pick-up in short-term capital inflow given the likelihood that interest rates in the advanced economies will remain low for an extended period."

In the next few days, the central region should be prepared for another typhoon, Linfa, which will bring more rains and result in more flooding, state broadcaster Vietnam Television (VTV) reported.  Footage broadcast by VTV showed fishermen being rescued by coastguard and helicopters as strong winds battered the central Vietnamese coast in the central province of Quang Tri. Floods have cut food supplies to thousands of people. Around 31,000 people have been displaced and more than 33,000 houses submerged and damaged by floods, according to a government report.  Vietnam is prone to destructive storms and flooding due to its long coastline. Natural disasters - predominantly floods and landslides triggered by storms - killed 132 people and injured 207 others in the country last year."

In the first half of this year, the Committee continued this gradual process of scaling back monetary policy accommodation, increasing its target range for the federal funds rate 1/4 percentage point at its meetings in both March and June. With these increases, the federal funds rate is currently in the range of 1-3/4 to 2 percent (figure 44).14 The Committee's decisions reflected the continued strengthening of the labor market and the accumulating evidence that, after many years of running below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, inflation had moved close to 2 percent."
drought,"Ongoing drought in Idaho will drastically shorten this year’s irrigation season for some farmers, officials said.
Farmers in south-central Idaho’s Wood River basin will face some of the biggest shortages, with an estimated 40 to 45 days before water from the Magic Reservoir runs out, according to David Stephenson, manager of Big Wood Canal Co. In a normal season, farmers might get water into late September.
Magic Reservoir, which supplies water to 36,000 acres of farmland, was only about a quarter full this year before dams were released last week, kicking off the season.
The reservoir holds water that flows through Big Wood River from melted snowfall in the mountains. The river is flowing at about 16% of its normal rate this year after record-low winter precipitation levels, Boise State Public Radio reported.
Prior to the winter, a dry summer and fall last year meant groundwater was already depleted as irrigators south of Bellevue pumped out of the aquifer, searching for any leftover moisture.
Carl Pendleton, a farmer who gets all of his water from Magic Reservoir, said the outlook is dismal.
“I sold my cow herd last week, the first time I’ve been out of livestock in my lifetime,” he said. “That’s the decisions we’re making based on this amount of water.”
The Idaho Department of Water Resources this spring could decide to curtail groundwater pumping to the north, which Pendleton said goes unchecked and exacerbates the shortages so that there isn’t enough to go around.
The federal Natural Resources Conservation Service said Lost River, parts of the Snake River and the Oakley and Salmon Falls reservoirs will also feel the effects of the drought."
drought,"Nearly two million people in Northern California have been placed under a water shortage emergency on Wednesday, June 9, 2021, as a severe drought continues to worsen in much of the western U.S. Mandatory water restrictions have been issued for Santa Clara County, while almost 17 million endangered salmon are being transported to the sea as rivers are drying up. Meanwhile, Lake Mead, the reservoir created by the Hoover Dam on the Nevada-Arizona border and the largest in the U.S., has reached historically low levels as the water dropped to 326.61 m (1 071.57 feet) above sea level. Meanwhile, farmers are warning that water from reservoirs is unnecessarily being let out to sea.
Much of the western U.S. has been suffering from severe drought, extreme heat, and fire risk this year, with Northern California already declaring a water shortage emergency on Wednesday.
""Santa Clara County is in extreme drought. We can’t afford to wait to act as our water supplies are being threatened locally and across California,"" said Tony Estremera, director of the Santa Clara Valley Water District, in a news release.
""We are in an emergency and Valley Water must do everything we can to protect our groundwater resources and ensure we can provide safe, clean water to Santa Clara County residents and businesses.""
""Increased conservation is also necessary to protect local water supplies and guard against groundwater overdraft, subsidence, and dry domestic wells, especially if the drought extends into next year.""
Under the declaration, almost two million Northern California residents are being asked to reduce their water usage by 15 percent as compared to 2019. People are also advised to limit watering their lawns and filling their pools.
""These actions are necessary as we face further challenges to our local water supply,"" added Estremera. ""We can’t predict how long this drought will last. But we know now is the time for action to protect our groundwater basins and make sure there is enough water for all our communities."""
other,"CPI inflation excluding food and fuel, which increased from July to September, remained steady in October. This reflected the softening of petroleum product prices on account of the reversal of taxes on petroleum products by the central and state governments. However, there was a hardening of housing inflation following the implementation of higher house rent allowances for central government employees under the 7th central pay commission award.The Reserve Bank¡¯s survey of households showed inflation expectations firming up in the latest round for both three months ahead and one year ahead horizons. Farm and industrial raw material costs rose in October. Firms responding to the Reserve Bank¡¯s Industrial Outlook Survey expect to pass on the increase in input prices to their output prices. Turning to other costs, wage growth in the organised sector edged up, while rural wage growth weakened, particularly in agriculture.Surplus liquidity in the system has continued to decline during October and November. Currency in circulation increased by _ 736 billion in Q3 (up to December 1, 2017) over end-September on festival demand. The Reserve Bank managed surplus liquidity through the conduct of regular variable rate reverse repo auctions of various tenors, ranging from overnight to 28 days. Net average daily absorption of liquidity under the LAF declined from _ 2,229 billion in September to _ 1,400 billion in October 2017 and further to _ 718 billion in November. The Reserve Bank conducted open market sales of _ 300 billion in October-November, taking the total absorption of durable liquidity during the financial year so far to _ 1.9 trillion, comprising _ 900 billion in the form of open market sales and _ 1 trillion of long-term treasury bills under the market stabilisation scheme. The weighted average call rate (WACR) traded 12 bps and 15 bps below the repo rate during October and November, respectively, as against 13 bps in September.Merchandise exports declined by 1.1 per cent in October 2017 after showing positive growth for 14 consecutive months. A sustained increase in exports of engineering goods, petroleum products and chemicals during the month was outweighed by a sharp fall in shipments of gems and jewellery, ready-made garments, and drugs and pharmaceuticals. Imports continued to expand, though at a modest pace. Although gold imports rose sequentially in October, they moderated from their level a year ago. Consequently, the trade deficit widened again in October. Despite moderation in September, net foreign direct investment in H1 of 2017-18 was at the same level as a year ago. With the announcement of the recapitalisation plan for public sector banks, foreign portfolio inflows into equities resumed sharply in October, after recording outflows in the preceding month. India¡¯s foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 401.94 billion on November 30, 2017."
other,"The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) transition is a significant event that poses challenges for banks and the financial system. RBI has issued an advisory on June 8, 2021 encouraging banks and other RBI regulated entities to cease entering into new contracts that use LIBOR as a reference rate and instead adopt any Alternative Reference Rate (ARR) as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021. The Reserve Bank has been engaging with banks and market bodies to proactively take steps, as necessary, to ensure a smooth transition for regulated entities and financial markets. In this context, it has been decided to amend the guidelines related to export credit in foreign currency and restructuring of derivative contracts as detailed below.Authorized dealers are currently permitted to extend Pre-shipment Credit in Foreign Currency (PCFC) to exporters for financing the purchase, processing, manufacturing or packing of goods prior to shipment at LIBOR / EURO-LIBOR / EURIBOR related rates of interest. In view of the impending discontinuance of LIBOR as a benchmark rate, it has been decided to permit banks to extend export credit using any other widely accepted Alternative Reference Rate in the currency concerned.For derivative contracts, as per extant instructions, change in any of the parameters of the original contract is treated as a restructuring and the resultant change in the mark-to-market value of the contract on the date of restructuring is required to be cash settled. Since the impending change in reference rate from LIBOR is a ""force majeure"" event, banks are being advised that change in reference rate from LIBOR / LIBOR-related benchmarks to an Alternative Reference Rate will not be treated as restructuring.The resolution plans implemented under the Resolution Framework for COVID-19 related stress announced on August 6, 2020 are required to meet the sector specific thresholds notified in respect of five financial parameters, four of which are related to the operational performance of the borrowing entity, viz. Total Debt to EBIDTA ratio (Total Debt/EBIDTA), Current Ratio, Debt Service Coverage Ratio and Average Debt Service Coverage Ratio, by March 31, 2022. Recognising the adverse impact of second wave of COVID-19 on revival of businesses, and the difficulty it may pose in meeting the operational parameters, it has been decided to defer the target date for meeting the specified thresholds in respect of the above parameters to October 1, 2022.As regards the parameter Total Outside Liabilities/Adjusted Total Net Worth (TOL/ATNW), this ratio reflects the revised capital structure (i.e., debt-equity mix) as required under the implementation conditions for the resolution framework and was expected to be crystallised upfront as part of the resolution plan. Accordingly, the date for achieving the same remains unchanged, i.e. March 31, 2022."
other,"Economic data in Australia over recent months have signalled a pick-up in the pace of growth in demand and activity. Capacity utilisation is high after a lengthy period of expansion, and business and consumer confidence are strong. These conditions have been accompanied recently by higher-than-expected underlying inflation.Growth of the Australian economy has for some time been assisted by favourable international conditions. Current expectations of official and private-sector observers are that the world economy will continue to grow at an above-average pace in both 2007 and 2008. These expectations have generally been revised upwards over recent months, with slower growth in the United States expected to be more than offset by stronger growth in China and the other major economies."
other,"Since the last meeting of the MPC in October 2017, global economic activity has been gaining momentum through the final quarter of the year, driven mainly by advanced economies (AEs). US growth remained largely resilient to hurricanes and grew at the highest pace in the past three years in Q3 of 2017, with positive contributions from private consumption, investment activity and net exports. The unemployment rate fell to 4.1 per cent in October, the lowest in the last 17 years. In the Euro area, economic activity expanded, underpinned by accommodative monetary policy and strong job gains. The Japanese economy also continued to grow in Q3, largely supported by external demand, which helped compensate for the slowing of domestic consumption.Among major emerging market economies (EMEs), the services sector remained the main driver of growth in China in Q3. However, weakness in real estate and construction activity remained a drag on growth. In Brazil, incoming data suggest that the recovery gained further momentum in Q3, with unemployment touching an intra-year low in September. Business and consumer confidence rose in October. Economic activity in Russia moderated in Q3 due to weakness in industrial production. The South African economy continued to face headwinds from weak manufacturing activity, elevated levels of unemployment and political instability.The latest assessment by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) for Q4 indicates a loss of momentum in global trade due to declining export orders. Crude oil prices touched a two-and-a-half-year high in early November on account of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries¡¯ (OPEC) efforts to rebalance the market. Bullion prices have been under some selling pressure on account of the rising US dollar. Weak non-oil commodity prices and subdued wage dynamics have kept inflation contained in many AEs, while the inflation scenario remains diverse in major EMEs."
Typhoon,"The death toll from twin typhoons that pounded the Philippines has reached 59, authorities said.
Typhoon Nesat -- known locally as Pedring -- has claimed 55 lives, and the death toll from Nalgae -- known locally as Quiel -- rose to four Monday as rescuers found the body of a man who drowned in raging floodwaters in Bulacan province.
Several towns in Bulacan and Pampanga provinces, in Central Luzon, were under chest-deep water when continuous rains from Typhoon Nesat last week prompted the release of water from four dams around the area. Among the worst hit was the city of Calumpit, Bulacan, where residents were stranded on rooftops for days.
Although floodwaters have begun to subside, hundreds of families remained in evacuation centers as more than 43,000 houses were damaged by Typhoon Nesat alone, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council said. It estimated damages to infrastructure and agriculture at more than 8 billion Philippine pesos (almost $183 million).
Several dikes have also been breached in Pampanga province during Typhoon Nesat."
earthquake,"Two earthquakes of 6.8 M and 6.3 M at a depth of 23 and 17 km occurred off the coast of Atacama Region (northern-Chile) on 1 September at 04:09 UTC (00:09 local time) and 04:30 UTC. The epicentre of the 6.8 M was approximately 50 km north-west of Huasco City (Huasco Province).
No tsunami warning was issued by the Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service of the Chilean Navy (SHOA), in charge of this service in Chile.
Several aftershocks of magnitude up to 5.5 M have been reported. USGS PAGER estimates that up to 1,000 people were exposed to very strong shaking and up to 17,000 to strong shaking.
According to media, there are no immediate reports of any casualties or damage."
other,"More than just a spicy staple served in Korean households and restaurants around the world, kimchi -- the iconic fermented vegetable dish -- has once again become the subject of a cultural feud between China and South Korea.
The latest salvo in the long-running culinary battle was fired in July, when South Korea's Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism released a notice that it's amending the official guidelines on ""the appropriate foreign language"" for a few Korean foods.
Among them is a stipulation that xinqi is to be the new, official Chinese name for kimchi. The old common translation, pao cai (salted fermented vegetables), would be retired.
The issue stems from the fact there's no Chinese character to represent the pronunciation of kimchi. As a result, the Ministry of Agriculture reportedly considered some 4,000 Chinese characters before deciding on xinqi, claiming that it sounded kind of like kimchi.
Xinqi (辛奇) consists of two Chinese characters: Xin means spicy. Qi means unique, or curious.
With the new name, the Seoul government hopes to draw a clear line between Korean kimchi and Chinese pickled vegetables -- the latter of which are called pao cai (泡菜) in China.
""With the use of word 'xinqi' for Kimchi in Chinese, the ministry expects Korean kimchi and Chinese pao cai are differentiated clearly and the awareness of South Korea's traditional dish, kimchi will be raised in China,"" the release said.
The new guideline is mandated for the South Korean government and affiliated organizations. But it's only a recommendation for private South Korean companies that need to translate the word kimchi into Chinese, in addition to Chinese media discussing the Korean dish.
Nonetheless it has kicked off a wave of heated debates among media and netizens in both countries."

valcano eruption,"Japan Mount Ontake volcano: Death toll reaches 47 Rescue workers in Japan have recovered more bodies from Mount Ontake, bringing to 47 the number of those killed by Saturday's volcanic eruption. The search resumed despite fears of toxic gases and another eruption. The number of those unaccounted for is unknown but estimates say hundreds were at the summit at the time. Dozens were injured by falling debris. Since then, volcanic tremors have been continuously detected with smoke still coming out of the volcano. Police had earlier put the latest death toll at 48 but then revised it down by one. The majority of bodies found near the summit on Wednesday were hikers, according to local police. Helicopters have been used to bring the dead down from Mount Ontake. Around 1,000 troops, police and fire fighters are involved in rescue operations."
wildfires,"Nearly three billion animals _ mammals, reptiles, birds, and frogs _ were killed or displaced by Australia’s devastating 2019-20 bushfires.
It’s almost three times an earlier estimate released in January.
The breakdown is 143 million mammals, 2.46 billion reptiles, 180 million birds, and 51 million frogs.
Those figures are revealed in an interim report entitled Australia’s 2019-2020 Bushfires: The Wildlife Toll, commissioned by the World Wide Fund for Nature and believed to be world first research.
Ten scientists from the University of Sydney, University of New South Wales, University of Newcastle, Charles Sturt University, and BirdLife Australia contributed the majority of the work.
The project is being led by Dr Lily Van Eeden and overseen by Professor Chris Dickman, both from the University of Sydney.
While results are still being finalised, the headline figure of nearly three billion animals impacted is unlikely to change.
“The interim findings are shocking. It’s hard to think of another event anywhere in the world in living memory that has killed or displaced that many animals. This ranks as one of the worst wildlife disasters in modern history,” said WWF-Australia CEO Dermot O’Gorman.
“When you think about nearly three billion native animals being in the path of the fires it is absolutely huge, it’s a difficult number to comprehend,” said Professor Dickman.
While the scientists cannot say how many animals died, Professor Dickman said the prospects for animals which escaped the flames were “probably not that great” because of a lack of food and shelter or being forced into habitat already occupied.
In January, Professor Dickman, working with WWF scientists, produced an early estimate that 1.25 billion animals were impacted. However, that calculation focused only on the states of New South Wales and Victoria.
Dr Van Eeden said for this project the team examined a fire impact area of 11.46 million hectares.
“We believe a continent-wide assessment of the number of animals that might be impacted has never been done in Australia before or anywhere else in the world. Other nations can build upon this research to improve understanding of bushfire impacts everywhere,” Dr Van Eeden said.
Mr O’Gorman said with extreme fires becoming more frequent because of climate change the interim findings “give other countries a window into the future of mega fires and their devastating impact on wildlife”.
He said the research had also been released in time to be considered by the review of Australia’s flagship environment law _ the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act.
“Following such a heavy toll on Australia’s wildlife, strengthening this law has never been more important. WWF will continue to advocate for policies that benefit both people and nature, restore what has been lost, and ensure we build back a more resilient Australia,” Mr O’Gorman said.
Professor Dickman said the research shows people that mega fires are changing the environment and depleting native biodiversity and change is necessary.
“How quickly can we decarbonise? How quickly can we stop our manic land clearing? We land clear at a rate that’s one of the highest in the world,” Professor Dickman said.
The recommendations in the interim report call for addressing knowledge gaps on wildlife densities and responses to fire, improving habitat connectivity to help mobile species escape fire, identifying and protecting unburnt habitat crucial to threatened species, improving fire prevention and management, and establishing rapid response teams to help species impacted by fire.
It's anticipated that the final report will be completed by the end of August 2020."
flood,"Sri Lanka floods, mudslides kill 16, affect 270,000 COLOMBO (AFP, XINHUA) -  Monsoon rains triggered floods and mudslides in Sri Lanka killing at least 16 people and leaving more than a quarter of a million homeless, the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) said Sunday (June 6).  Heavy downpours in 10 out of the country’s 25 districts since Friday buried most of the victims alive, the DMC said.  In the central Kegalle district, a pet dog pointed rescuers to a location where four members of the same family were buried alive, officials said.  However, all four were found dead by the time they were pulled out with the help of troops.  Security forces were deployed in several districts to help evacuate marooned villagers.  The DMC said 270,000 people were driven out of flooded homes and were sheltering with friends or relatives, as well as inside state-run welfare centres."
other,"The first bi-monthly resolution of 2018-19 in April projected CPI inflation in the range of 4.7-5.1 per cent in H1:2018-19 and 4.4 per cent in H2, including the HRA impact for central government employees with risks tilted to the upside. Excluding the impact of HRA revisions, CPI inflation was projected at 4.4-4.7 per cent in H1:2018-19 and 4.4 per cent in H2. Actual inflation outcomes since the April policy have evolved broadly on the lines of the projected trajectory. However, there has been an important compositional shift. While the summer momentum in vegetable prices was weaker than the usual pattern, there was an abrupt acceleration in CPI inflation excluding food and fuel.The headline inflation outlook is driven primarily by two countervailing effects. On the one hand, CPI inflation excluding food and fuel rose sharply in April over March by 80 basis points to reach an ex-HRA level of 5.3 per cent, suggesting a hardening of underlying inflationary pressures. Furthermore, since the MPC¡¯s meeting in early April, the price of Indian basket of crude surged from US$ 66 a barrel to US$ 74. This, along with an increase in other global commodity prices and recent global financial market developments, has resulted in a firming up of input cost pressures, as also confirmed in the Reserve Bank¡¯s IOS for manufacturing firms in Q2:2018-19. The resulting pick-up in the momentum of inflation excluding food, fuel and HRA has imparted persistence into higher CPI projections for 2018-19. On the other hand, food inflation has remained muted over the past few months and the usual seasonal pickup delayed, softening the projections in the short run. Taking these effects into account, projected CPI inflation for 2018-19 is revised to 4.8-4.9 per cent in H1 and 4.7 per cent in H2, including the HRA impact for central government employees, with risks tilted to the upside (Chart 1). Excluding the impact of HRA revisions, CPI inflation is projected at 4.6 per cent in H1 and 4.7 per cent in H2.Turning to the growth outlook, the CSO¡¯s provisional estimates have placed GDP growth for Q4:2017-18 at 7.7 per cent _ 70 basis points higher than that in Q3 _ given the sharp acceleration in investment and construction activity. With improving capacity utilisation and credit offtake, investment activity is expected to remain robust even as there has been some tightening of financing conditions in recent months. Global demand has also been buoyant, which should encourage exports and provide a further thrust to investment. The sharp rise in petroleum product prices, however, is likely to impact disposable incomes. Consumption, both rural and urban, remains healthy and is expected to strengthen further. According to the early results of the Reserve Bank¡¯s IOS, activity in the manufacturing sector is expected to moderate marginally in Q2:2018-19 on account of deterioration in the overall business situation and order book. On the basis of an overall assessment, GDP growth for 2018-19 is retained at 7.4 per cent as in the April policy. GDP growth is projected in the range of 7.5-7.6 per cent in H1 and 7.3-7.4 per cent in H2, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2)."
other,"Industrial growth also strengthened, reflecting the robust performance of manufacturing, which accelerated for three consecutive quarters in Q4. Capacity utilisation by manufacturing firms increased significantly in Q4:2017-18 as revealed in the latest round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s order books, inventories and capacity utilisation survey (OBICUS). The output of eight core industries accelerated in April on account of a sharp expansion in coal production, which reached a 42-month peak. Cement output also posted double-digit growth for the sixth consecutive month in April. However, electricity generation slowed down. As per the early results of the Reserve Bank¡¯s April-June round of the industrial outlook survey (IOS), activity is expected to expand at a lower rate in Q1:2018-19 due to a significant rise in input prices and perceptions of softening domestic and external demand conditions. However, the manufacturing PMI remained in an expansionary mode for the tenth consecutive month in May on the back of new domestic orders and exports.Although services sector growth was revised downwards on account of lower growth in some constituents such as trade, hotels, transport & communication, and financial services, it remained robust. Construction activity recorded the highest growth in Q4 in the new series (base 2011-12). Various high frequency indicators also suggest resilient performance of the services sector. Improving sales of tractors and two-wheelers suggest strengthening of rural demand. Commercial vehicle sales also accelerated in April. Revenue-earning freight traffic of railways picked up, driven by improved movement in coal, fertilisers, and cement. Growth in passenger vehicle sales accelerated but port traffic decelerated for the third successive month in April. Domestic air passenger traffic rose significantly in April. Two key indicators of construction activity showed improvement _ cement production growth accelerated and steel consumption turned around. Services PMI moved slightly into contraction in May, reflecting decline in business activity and stagnation in new orders.Retail inflation, measured by the year-on-year change in the CPI, rose sharply to 4.6 per cent in April, driven mainly by a significant increase in inflation excluding food and fuel. Excluding the estimated impact of an increase in house rent allowances (HRAs) for central government employees, headline inflation was at 4.2 per cent in April, up from 3.9 per cent in March. Food inflation moderated for the fourth successive month, pulled down by vegetables due to lower than the usual seasonal increase in their prices, and pulses and sugar which continued to experience deflation. However, within the food group, inflation increased in respect of cereals, fruits, prepared meals, meat and fish."
wildfires,"Drought conditions out West have combined with strong winds and triple-digit heat to spark a particularly devastating wildfire season.
Here, a firefighter works to save a residence as the Butte fire burns in San Andreas, California, September 11, 2015. Evacuation orders were expanded to thousands of homes in northern California's Sierras that day, as the rapidly spreading wildfire roared through drought-parched timber and brush, threatening mountain communities near Sacramento. As of September 11th, the flames had devoured nearly 32,000 acres."
Typhoon,"China was on its highest alert for Typhoon Fitow Sunday, with tens of thousands evacuated as the storm was set to slam into the east coast as early as Sunday night.
The National Meteorological Centre issued a red alert for the storm, saying it was expected to make landfall in China late Sunday or early Monday somewhere between the south of Zhejiang province and the north of Fujian province.
The storm, which the centre classified as ""strong"" with winds up to 151 kilometres (94 miles) an hour, was located Sunday afternoon about 280 kilometres southeast of the city of Wenzhou in Zhejiang and moving at a speed of 18 kilometres an hour.
Zhejiang has so far evacuated more than 130,000 people ahead of the expected landfall, state news agency Xinhua said.
""We must not leave anybody in danger,"" said Li Qiang, the provincial governor.
He urged local authorities to increase inspections of dams and reservoirs as well as safety checks of chemical plants and other important facilities, Xinhua reported.
Fitow was expected to bring heavy rain and strong winds, Xinhua added, quoting the weather centre as saying it was unusual for a typhoon to come ashore in China's southeast during October. It urged authorities and residents to be especially alert.
Chinese maritime authorities also issued red alerts, warning of storm tides and waves kicked up by Fitow.
Fishermen were urged to return to port and local authorities were told to prepare harbour facilities and sea walls for high tides.
Fitow, named after a flower from Micronesia, comes just two weeks after Typhoon Usagi wreaked havoc in the region.
The storm, which Xinhua described as the 23rd to hit China this year, passed through Japan's southern Okinawan island chain, forcing flight cancellations and causing power outages.
Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau issued a warning over the storm Sunday morning as it was
barrelling past the north of the island.
A total of 103 international flights were cancelled in Taiwan while 14 flights were delayed. Seventeen ferry services between Taiwan and offshore islands were also terminated.
Some 670 mountain climbers were advised to scrap their plans as the bureau forecast torrential rain in mountainous areas in the north and northeast.
The Taiwan weather bureau said the typhoon had brought up to 400 mm (16 inches) of rainfall although it was not likely to make landfall on the island.
Taiwan's military has ordered more than 20,000 troops on standby."
Typhoon,"Millions of residents were affected as a rainstorm hit a large swathe of eastern China on Tuesday, flooding downtown areas and snarling traffic.
The storm, triggered under the influence of Typhoon Fitow, continued to strike Shanghai and Zhejiang province, forcing both to raise the rainstorm alarm to the highest level of red on Tuesday morning.
In the 12 hours up to 11 am on Tuesday Shanghai reported average rainfall of more than 100 millimeters, while on the outskirts of the city 200 mm fell.
Zhang Ruiyi, a chief service officer at the Shanghai Meteorological Bureau, said the storm was caused by the remaining depression from Fitow encountering cold air.
The continuous rain, the rising tide and discharge of floodwater from upstream Taihu Lake caused the Huangpu River, which runs through Shanghai, to rise past the warning line on Tuesday.
According to the city's flood control headquarters, the river burst its flood control wall in suburban sections. No deaths were reported in the region.
In Zhejiang, Yuyao, a city with a population of about 850,000, was one of the hardest hit. More than 70 percent of the city's downtown area was flooded, forcing public transportation to be suspended.
The city's power and tap water supplies were also interrupted, and residents are short of food and clean water. Soldiers rushed in large trucks and speedboats to help with disaster response.
But relief for residents in the region is on the way, with forecasters in Shanghai predicting cloudy weather on Wednesday and clear skies from Thursday.
Meteorological authorities in Zhejiang lowered the red rainstorm alarm at 12:30 pm on Tuesday, saying that most areas of the province will remain cloudy on Wednesday and Thursday, with showers in some areas.
Typhoon Danas, following on the heels of Fitow, has turned northeast in the Pacific and is unlikely to make landfall on the Chinese mainland. Meteorologists warned that high winds will hit the east coast although Danas has been weakening.
The death toll from Fitow and the rainstorm it generated has risen to six with another four missing in Zhejiang.
Figures from the provincial flood control headquarters show that by 6 pm on Monday more than 6.31 million people had been affected, with 4,000 houses flattened.
Floods also damaged hundreds of thousands of hectares of crops, killed more than 11,000 livestock, disrupted traffic and telecommunications, put dams and reservoirs at risk and caused direct economic losses of 8.4 billion yuan ($1.37 billion) in Zhejiang.
Li Minji, an official at Hangzhou's flood control department, said flooding was reported in 31 communities and 58 sections of roads in the city on Tuesday, with emergency workers busy clearing floodwaters and bringing in traffic controls.
The water level at popular tourist attraction West Lake rose to 7.48 meters on Tuesday, 0.18 meters higher than the danger level.
In Shanghai, pictures posted by Internet users showed a flooded classroom at Tongji University, two residents in Songjiang district rowing a boat on a flooded road, and a bus nearly submerged in a low-lying area.
Cheng Xu, 40, was just one of many people caught out by the floods on Monday. Her flight, due to arrive at Hangzhou airport at 7 am, was delayed for four hours. A shuttle bus then took two and a half hours to make a journey usually taking 45 minutes.
After she got off the bus, it took her another two hours to get close to her home, with traffic controls in place on the road to her apartment building because of the flooding.
""No cars were allowed on that road. I dragged my suitcases, weighing almost 20 kilograms, and walked in heavy rain from the street to my apartment,"" she said.
Zhu Zheng, who lives in Hangzhou's Yuhang district, said he woke up to find floodwater inside at least 12 cars in the area.
Flood control departments in Zhejiang launched an emergency response system to help deal with the flooding and urged regional governments to pay close attention to mountain torrents, mudslides, landslides, flash floods in cities and house collapses."
other,"Global economic growth slowed late in 2011, but that has not developed into a major downturn and a number of indicators suggest that, outside of Europe, conditions have stabilised over recent months. The US economy has continued to expand at a moderate pace over the year to date and there are tentative signs that activity in east Asia is continuing to pick up after the effects of the natural disasters of 2011. Growth has slowed to a more sustainable pace in China, largely reflecting the effect of tighter domestic policies, which has helped to ease inflationary pressures. Nonetheless, the Chinese economy still grew by about 8 per cent over the year to March."
other,"Deflation in the prices of pulses persisted on the back of over-supply, though the pace of deflation moderated during H1. Pulses account for 2.4 per cent of the CPI and 5.2 per cent of the food and beverages sub-component. Mandi level prices of some pulses such as arhar and urad remained below their minimum support prices (MSPs) in major producing states such as Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka. In response, several measures that had been undertaken by the government in the previous year were extended into 2018-19 such as (i) removal of the export ban on all pulses; and (ii) imposition of import duty of 60 per cent on gram and 30 per cent on masoor to provide some relief to farmers. Nonetheless, pulses prices continued to rule well below their historical trend during H1:2018-19 (Chart II.11).Prices of sugar and confectionery also remained in deflation zone from February 2018 on account of surplus production during the sugarcane season of 2017-18 (Charts II.7 and II.8). Domestic sugar prices have closely tracked global price movements which have also been in deflation due to excess global supply. In view of the sharp decline in sugar prices, the government raised the import duty on sugar to 100 per cent, besides re-imposing stockholding limits on sugar sales and fixing the ex-mill sugar prices to _29 per kg in June 2018. Moreover, the customs duty on export of sugar was withdrawn to encourage the sugar industry. These measures, along with supply disruptions in July following the transporters¡¯ strike, drove up sugar prices during June-August, though y-o-y inflation continued to be in the negative zone."
other,"The MPC notes that the inflation outlook is clouded by several uncertainties on the upside. First, the staggered impact of HRA increases by various state governments may push up headline inflation further over the baseline in 2018-19, and potentially induce second-round effects. Second, a pick-up in global growth may exert further pressure on crude oil and commodity prices with implications for domestic inflation. Third, the Union Budget 2018-19 has proposed revised guidelines for arriving at the minimum support prices (MSPs) for kharif crops, although the exact magnitude of its impact on inflation cannot be fully assessed at this stage. Fourth, the Union Budget has also proposed an increase in customs duty on a number of items. Fifth, fiscal slippage as indicated in the Union Budget could impinge on the inflation outlook. Apart from the direct impact on inflation, fiscal slippage has broader macro-financial implications, notably on economy-wide costs of borrowing which have already started to rise. This may feed into inflation. Sixth, the confluence of domestic fiscal developments and normalisation of monetary policy by major advanced economies could further adversely impact financing conditions and undermine the confidence of external investors. There is, therefore, need for vigilance around the evolving inflation scenario in the coming months. There are also mitigating factors. First, capacity utilisation remains subdued. Second, oil prices have moved both ways in the recent period and can potentially soften from current levels based on production response. Third, rural real wage growth is moderate.Accordingly, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate on hold and continue with the neutral stance. The MPC reiterates its commitment to keep headline inflation close to 4 per cent on a durable basis.The MPC notes that the economy is on a recovery path, including early signs of a revival of investment activity. Global demand is improving, which should help strengthen domestic investment activity. The focus of the Union Budget on the rural and infrastructure sectors is also a welcome development as it would support rural incomes and investment, and in turn provide a further push to aggregate demand and economic activity. On the downside, the deterioration in public finances risks crowding out of private financing and investment. The Committee is of the view that the nascent recovery needs to be carefully nurtured and growth put on a sustainably higher path through conducive and stable macro-financial management."
wildfires,"Firefighters in California gained ground on Monday against a massive wildfire burning part of Yosemite National Park, although complete containment may be weeks away, officials said.
Crews working through the night got an edge on the so-called Rim Fire, a 350-square mile (906-square km) blaze that has charred the California park's Northwest, said Andrea Capps, spokeswoman for the Rim Fire command center.
They connected containment lines near the fire's northwestern and western borders, where most of the 4,500 homes threatened by the blaze are located, she said.
The fire was 60 percent contained by early Monday, a 15 percent increase from the night before.
""On Monday night is when it all really tied together,"" Capps said. ""It's looking really good over there right now. They're calling that containment line secure.""
Despite the jump in containment, Capps said fire analysts estimate that it could take until September 20 to contain the Rim Fire fully. Steep terrain and high, unpredictable winds will likely pose the main challenges in digging and burning containment lines around the blaze.
""The majority of the containment lines will probably be really strong by the middle, end of this week, but they just want to give themselves enough time to make sure it's fully contained,"" Capps said.
Wet weather expected in the area on Monday raised hopes, but the possibility of thunderstorms kept officials wary.
""Rain is good, but the winds that come with the pressure changes with the thunderstorms could lead to some unpredictable (fire) behaviour,"" Capps said. ""We have had a few sprinkles on Tuesday morning, and so we're all waiting to see what happens.""
While the majority of the fire was burning on Stanislaus National Forest, 60,214 acres, or about 27 percent, of the fire has crossed the Yosemite National Park border.
The massive blaze has scorched an area larger than many US cities and is the fourth-largest on record in California, burning more than 220,000 acres over the past two weeks.
Over the past several years, wildfires in the US West have become increasingly frequent and at times deadly. Earlier this year, 19 firefighters were killed in a blaze in Arizona, and wildfires have raged in several states, including Nevada, Alaska and New Mexico."
other,"Recent data point to a marked deterioration in world economic conditions in late 2008. Output contracted significantly in the December quarter in the major advanced economies as well as in a number of emerging market economies, and there were unusually sharp falls in international trade and industrial production. The Chinese economy, though still growing, also slowed significantly.The main factor behind this highly synchronised deterioration in global activity seems to have been the shock to confidence that followed the Lehman Brothers collapse in mid September. The loss of confidence was reflected in sharply declining equity and commodity prices, in survey-based measures of business and consumer sentiment around the world, and in a widespread downturn in private spending. These effects are likely to have been amplified by a cyclical slowdown in China, as well as by tighter conditions in global credit markets, including in relation to trade finance."

other,"Italy's cheap homes bonanza continues to lure hundreds of interested buyers, despite the pandemic. But what happens once someone takes the plunge and invests their (small) chunk of change in a crumbling corner of a remote town?
For Roy Patrick, a 67-year-old British car and motorbike fanatic who bought an old school house in the northern mountain village of Carrega Ligure for about $16,500, it's been an adventure -- not without mishaps such as a falling chimney and a jammed door -- and also a joy.
Patrick, from Oxford, bought the property after finding himself in the village, in the mountains on the border of Italy's Piedmont and Ligure regions, almost by accident.
He arrived after disembarking from a post-divorce Mediterranean cruise in the port of Genoa, where he met people who told him about the wonders of the village. He decided to visit and take a look and was fascinated by the place.
After touring several old properties he fell in love with the 1930s school building and bought it in 2017.
""The other houses were nice but had nothing special, they could have been in any little Italian village tucked away in alleys,"" says Patrick. ""But this one was particular, the view is unique: the way the sun goes down over the mountains when it sets, you'd say 'wow.' It's my personal Arcadia, my Nirvana, therapeutic place."""
other,"The Federal Reserve is committed to ensuring that the Congress and the public have all the information needed to understand our decisions and to be assured of the integrity of our operations. Indeed, on matters related to the conduct of monetary policy, the Federal Reserve is already one of the most transparent central banks in the world, providing detailed records and explanations of its decisions. Over the past year, the Federal Reserve also took a number of steps to enhance the transparency of its special credit and liquidity facilities, including the provision of regular, extensive reports to the Congress and the public; and we have worked closely with the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the Congress, and private-sector auditors on a range of matters relating to these facilities.While the emergency credit and liquidity facilities were important tools for implementing monetary policy during the crisis, we understand that the unusual nature of those facilities creates a special obligation to assure the Congress and the public of the integrity of their operation. Accordingly, we would welcome a review by the GAO of the Federal Reserve's management of all facilities created under emergency authorities.6 In particular, we would support legislation authorizing the GAO to audit the operational integrity, collateral policies, use of third-party contractors, accounting, financial reporting, and internal controls of these special credit and liquidity facilities. The Federal Reserve will, of course, cooperate fully and actively in all reviews. We are also prepared to support legislation that would require the release of the identities of the firms that participated in each special facility after an appropriate delay. It is important that the release occur after a lag that is sufficiently long that investors will not view an institution's use of one of the facilities as a possible indication of ongoing financial problems, thereby undermining market confidence in the institution or discouraging use of any future facility that might become necessary to protect the U.S. economy. An appropriate delay would also allow firms adequate time to inform investors through annual reports and other public documents of their use of Federal Reserve facilities.Looking ahead, we will continue to work with the Congress in identifying approaches for enhancing the Federal Reserve's transparency that are consistent with our statutory objectives of fostering maximum employment and price stability. In particular, it is vital that the conduct of monetary policy continue to be insulated from short-term political pressures so that the FOMC can make policy decisions in the longer-term economic interests of the American people. Moreover, the confidentiality of discount window lending to individual depository institutions must be maintained so that the Federal Reserve continues to have effective ways to provide liquidity to depository institutions under circumstances where other sources of funding are not available. The Federal Reserve's ability to inject liquidity into the financial system is critical for preserving financial stability and for supporting depositories' key role in meeting the ongoing credit needs of firms and households."
other,"The second advance estimates of the National Statistics Office released in February 2020 implied real GDP growth of 4.7 per cent for Q4:2019-20 within the annual estimate of 5 per cent for the year as a whole. This is now at risk from the pandemic¡¯s impact on the economy. High frequency indicators suggest that private final consumption expenditure has been hit hardest, even as gross fixed capital formation has been in contraction since Q2:2019-20. On the supply side, the outlook for agriculture and allied activities appears to be the only silver lining, with foodgrains output at 292 million tonnes being 2.4 per cent higher than a year ago. A pick-up in manufacturing and electricity generation pulled industrial production into positive territory in January 2020 after intermittent contraction and/or lacklustre activity over the past five months; however, more data will need to be watched to assess whether the recent uptick will endure in the face of COVID-19. Meanwhile, most service sector indicators for January and February 2020 moderated or declined. Since then anecdotal evidence suggests that several services such as trade, tourism, airlines, the hospitality sector and construction have been further adversely impacted by the pandemic. Dislocations in casual and contract labour would result in losses of activity in other sectors as well. Retail inflation, measured by the consumer price index, peaked in January 2020 and fell by a full percentage point in February 2020 to 6.6 per cent, as the ebbing of onion prices brought down food inflation from double digits in the preceding two months. Price pressures, however, remain firm across protein-rich items, edible oils and pulses; but the shock to demand from COVID-19 may weaken them going forward. While fuel inflation increased sharply in February on the back of the delayed domestic adjustment to international LPG prices, the plunge in international crude prices in March may bring a measure of relief to the extent it is allowed to pass-through. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel eased in February under the weight of softer prices of transport and communication, and personal care. Households¡¯ inflation expectations a year ahead softened by 20 bps in the March 2020 round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s survey.Domestic financial conditions have tightened considerably, with equity markets facing massive sell-offs by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs). In the bond market too, yields have risen on sustained FPI selling, while redemption pressures, drop in trading activity and generalised risk aversion have pushed up yields to elevated levels in commercial paper, corporate bond and other fixed income segments. In the forex market, the Indian rupee (INR) has been under continuous downward pressure. Under these conditions, the Reserve Bank has endeavoured to keep financial markets liquid, stable and functioning normally. Systemic liquidity surplus, as reflected in net absorptions under the LAF, averaged _ 2.86 lakh crore in March (up to March 25, 2020). In addition, the Reserve Bank undertook unconventional operations in the form of auctions of what is called ¡®operation twist¡¯ involving the simultaneous sale of short-term government securities (of _ 28,276 crore) and purchase of long-term securities (of _ 40,000 crore), cumulatively injecting a net amount of _ 11,724 crore. The Reserve Bank also conducted five long term repo auctions of 1 year and 3 years tenors of a cumulative amount of _ 1.25 lakh crore so far to inject liquidity and improve monetary transmission. It also conducted two sell-buy swap auctions to inject cumulatively US dollar liquidity into the forex market to the tune of US$ 2.71 billion on March 16 and 23. Open market purchase operations of _ 10,000 crore on March 20 and _ 15,000 crore each on March 24 and March 26 have been conducted to bolster liquidity and smoothen financial conditions.In the external sector, merchandise exports expanded in February 2020 after posting six consecutive months of contraction. Import growth also moved into positive territory after eight months of continuous decline. Consequently, the trade deficit widened marginally on a year-on-year basis although it was lower than its level a month ago. On March 12, the Reserve Bank released balance of payments data which showed the current account having moved to near balance in Q3:2019-20 with a deficit of only 0.2 per cent of GDP. On the financing side, net FDI inflows at US$ 37.8 billion during April-January 2019-20 were substantially higher than a year ago. Portfolio investment recorded net outflows of US$ 5.2 billion during 2019-20 (up to March 25), down from US$ 6.6 billion a year ago. India¡¯s foreign exchange reserves reached a level of US$ 487.2 billion on March 6, 2020 _ an increase of US$ 74.4 billion over their end-March 2019 level."
drought,"The latest famine in Somalia has put a spotlight on the urgent need to develop national and regional drought policies, according to the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, which are jointly leading the international action to address the growing impact of droughts.
Drought is expected to continue in hard-hit southern Somalia during August and September, as well as parts of Ethiopia, Djibouti and Kenya, according to the latest WMO Climate Outlook Forum for the region, which provides regional climate forecasts. The IGAD Climate Prediction and Applications Centre (ICPAC) already called for preparedness for an ongoing long period of drought over parts of the equatorial region in its climate update for the Greater Horn of Africa on 15 January 2011.
Droughts have become more common over the past two decades. This is consistent with reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, stating that the world has become more drought-prone over the last 25 years, and will see an increased frequency of droughts in the future.
""Droughts do not happen overnight,"" said Luc Gnacadja, Executive Secretary of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), responding to the declaration of famine by the United Nations earlier this month. ""The UNCCD joins the calls on the international community to respond urgently to this crisis. At the same time, we stress the need for effective, long-term solutions to the root causes of famine in drought-prone regions, such as implementation of drought management systems and measures to stop desertification, which means land degradation in drylands.""
""We are moving forward quickly to provide integrated drought information to help decision-makers deal with drought, such as the one underway right now in East Africa,"" said Michel Jarraud, Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization. ""Drought is a serious and growing problem in many countries. Adaptation to drought, desertification and climate change urgently needs to be mainstreamed in national development policies.""
Mr Gnacadja visited Mr Jarraud at WMO earlier this month to discuss cooperation between the two organizations, following the UN declaration of famine for two provinces in southern Somalia on 13 July 2011. The two organizations have a long-standing partnership. Most recently they have championed the use of the Standard Precipitation Index, as a universal meteorological drought index to improve monitoring and climate risk management among countries."

earthquake,"Magnitude 7.8 earthquake strikes off coast of Alaska (CNN)An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 struck off southern Alaska's coast late Tuesday, shaking the Alaska Peninsula and briefly sparking tsunami concerns before officials said no destructive waves were coming. The earthquake was centered in the Pacific Ocean about 60 miles southeast of Perryville on the sparsely populated Alaska Peninsula, striking around 10:12 p.m. local time (2:12 a.m. Wednesday ET). The Alaska Peninsula protrudes from mainland Alaska and is flanked to the southwest by the Aleutian Islands. Reports of significant damage, if any, weren't immediately available. A tsunami warning initially was issued for south Alaska and the Alaska Peninsula, but was canceled by early Wednesday, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The warning sent people to higher ground in cities like Sand Point, an island community of about 1,000 people off the peninsula, the Anchorage Daily News reported. People in Sand Point gathered at a high school until shortly after midnight, when officials gave an all-clear, Jordan Keeler, an Anchorage-based city administrator, told the newspaper."

At least five people are known to have died, but amid widespread reports of landslides, floods, collapsed buildings and fires, the death toll is expected to rise.
The quake hit at 2.46pm (5.45am GMT), about 6 miles below sea level and 78 miles off the east coast. It was swiftly followed by five powerful aftershocks of up to 7.1 magnitude. In Tokyo people screamed and grabbed each other's hands as the quake struck. The shock was so powerful it was felt as far away as Beijing."

wildfires,"Firefighters got good news from the weather on Sunday, as winds slowed down and humidity started to build, allowing crews a window to slow the dizzying-fast pace of the Caldor Fire as it closed in on 100,000 acres, officials said.
Authorities also announced the shut-down of all the national forests in Northern California to be closed late Sunday through Labor Day because of fire danger, and residents in El Dorado County were plagued by hazardous air conditions.
Highway 50 remained closed into Sunday afternoon, after the fire jumped it Saturday night. Fire officials said the highway was a key line in slowing the fire’s spread that they had hoped the fire would not cross.
By Sunday morning, the Caldor Fire had spread to 98,149 acres, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. It has been burning for eight full days and is 0% contained, and crews have new challenges awaiting them, among them the vegetation fire fuels in steep canyons and very dense forested areas that could be difficult to access, Cal Fire spokesman Capt. Stephen Horner said.
Yet, the weather is providing a break, enough so that air tankers were expected to be used.
The blaze is one of five major ones that crews are fighting in Northern California.
The largest of those, the Dixie Fire, has burned 721,298 acres and is 37% contained. Wind gusts that brought red flag conditions fueled a fast spread in the East Zone of the fire, Cal Fire said, but increased humidity overnight slowed the fire in the West Zone and may do so again Sunday.
As of Sunday morning, the Monument Fire in Trinity County had burned 147,323 acres and was 16% contained, while the McFarland Fire in Shasta, Trinity and Tehama counties had burned 117,985 acres and was 66% contained.
Authorities did not have current information on the Cache Fire on Sunday.
The wildfires caused the U.S. Forest Service to announce the closure of nine national forests, including the Tahoe National Forest and the Lake Tahoe Basin — starting at 11:59 p.m. Sunday. The parks will be closed at least through Sept. 6.
People may not visit or drive through the forests, forest service officials said. The other forests that were closed were the Plumas, Lassen, Mendocino, Klamath, Six Rivers, Shasta-Trinity and Modoc national forests."

La Soufrière, which had been dormant for decades, started showing volcanic activity in December, but that increased this week. The first sign that an eruption was imminent came on Thursday evening, when a lava dome became visible on La Soufrière. Just before 09:00 on Friday (13:00 GMT), seismologists from the University of the West Indies confirmed that an ""explosive eruption"" was under way. Evacuees were taken to cruise ships and safer parts of the island."
wildfires,"In recent weeks, nine major fires have ignited in the Brazilian Amazon, heralding the start of another fire season which, after a particularly dry year, experts say could be a bad one.
“The rainy season is already finished and it was a bad [dry] rainy season,” Marcelo Seluchi, a meteorologist in Brazil’s national space research institute (INPE) disaster monitoring center told Reuters. “The fire season will probably be bad.”
The first major fire of the year occurred on May 19, near the border of Serra Ricardo Franco State Park in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil along the southern edge of the Amazon, according to Amazon Conservation Association’s Monitoring of the Andean Amazon Project (MAAP).
So far, all nine of this year’s fires have occurred in the state of Mato Grosso and have averaged around 200 hectares (494 acres) each, an area the size of the Principality of Monaco."
other,"Overall, the MPC¡¯s considered judgement call to wait out the unravelling of the transitory effects of demonetisation has been broadly borne out. While these effects are still playing out, they are distinctly on the wane and should fade away by the Q4 of 2016-17. While inflation has ticked up in its latest reading, its path through 2017-18 appears uneven and challenged by upside risks and unfavourable base effects towards the second half of the year. Moreover, underlying inflation pressures persist, especially in prices of services. Input cost pressures are gradually bringing back pricing power to enterprises as demand conditions improve. The MPC remains committed to bringing headline inflation closer to 4.0 per cent on a durable basis and in a calibrated manner. Accordingly, inflation developments have to be closely and continuously monitored, with food price pressures kept in check so that inflation expectations can be re-anchored. At the same time, the output gap is gradually closing. Consequently, aggregate demand pressures could build up, with implications for the inflation trajectory.Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to keep the policy rate unchanged in this review while persevering with a neutral stance. The future course of monetary policy will largely depend on incoming data on how macroeconomic conditions are evolving. Banks have reduced lending rates, although further scope for a more complete transmission of policy impulses remains, including for small savings/administered rates1. It is in this context that greater clarity about liquidity management is being provided, even as surplus liquidity is being steadily drained out. Along with rebalancing liquidity conditions, it will be the Reserve Bank¡¯s endeavour to put the resolution of banks¡¯ stressed assets on a firm footing and create congenial conditions for bank credit to revive and flow to productive sectors of the economy."
Typhoon,"Deaths And Missing People Reported From Tropical Depression Hanna In Mexico As Hurricane Hanna barreled through the Atlantic Ocean this weekend, Texas and Mexico both braced for calamity, but it was Mexico that saw death. According to Mexican newspaper accounts, the bodies of a 7-year-old girl and her mother were found Monday in Saltillo, near Monterrey in northeastern Mexico, after the van they were in ran out of gas and was dragged down an overflowing tributary. They were swept away by the current. Some family members escaped, according to the Mexican papers, including the girl's 11-year-old sister, who reportedly managed to survive by clinging to branches. In the border city of Reynosa, one woman reportedly died after suffering a seizure and drowning in the floodwater left by Hanna. Three children were reported missing in a nearby neighborhood, after they fell from a tree into the water. Texas saw no casualties. After Hanna — the first hurricane of the season before being downgraded to a tropical storm, and then a tropical depression — hit the southwestern part of the state on Saturday, 200,000 locations were left without power. As of Monday morning, AEP Texas reported 60,000 outages remaining. Restoring power was complicated by severe flooding in some areas that limited access to substations, the utility said. Hanna made landfall about 90 miles south of Corpus Christi on Saturday evening, before moving into Mexico. In Texas, it dropped up to 15 inches of rain in some areas and caused extensive flooding and beach erosion. The Texas State Aquarium saw minor damage — mostly debris brought in by the storm surge. And the Bob Hall Pier, a local tourist destination, was damaged for the first time in its 37-year history. A video that circulated widely on social media over the weekend purported to show a section of the southern border wall crashing down in Hanna's high winds. But U.S. Customs and Border Protection told Texas Public Radio that the video appears to be from last month, when wind gusts knocked over several border wall panels at a construction site in New Mexico. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced Sunday that the Federal Emergency Management Agency and President Trump granted the state's request for emergency disaster relief. The state prepared for impact late last week, as hospitals in the area were already strained to near-capacity with coronavirus patients. Houston's deputy director for emergency management said Hurricane Hanna was a test of the state's ability to respond to disaster while trying to limit the spread of the coronavirus. ""We'll be looking for lessons learned even from yesterday's storm — what went well, what didn't go well, how were other jurisdictions helping to jump in response?""

Fire officials do not know what caused the fire, but about 12 hours after it began they said it had already burned more than 6,000 hectares.  The flames and smoke prompted road closures, including part of a highway that links the Los Angeles area and Las Vegas.
Some 700 personnel are working to contain the fire.  Their job is being made more difficult by hot, windy, dry weather.
Wildfires are common in California and other western states during the warm summer months.
Also Tuesday, authorities in northern California lifted some evacuation orders as fire crews made progress against another fire that police say was started by an arsonist.  They have arrested a 40-year-old man suspected of started multiple fires in the area during the past year.

The male pilot has not been identified, but officials say that he was declared dead at the scene of the crash.
""This is a very tragic event and it does have an impact,"" said Len MacCharles, the incident commander.
""It has an impact on everybody who's involved in putting this community back together. This is a resilient community and they continue to put forth the effort that is needed.""
The chopper was privately contracted by the Alberta government. According to preliminary reports, the helicopter is operated by Campbell Helicopters Limited in Abbotsford, B.C.
Crews from out-of-province have been taking part in the massive fire fighting campaign, and an official with the Transportation Safety Board confirmed that the Bell 212 helicopter was fighting fires in the region.
Just after the crash at 3:30 p.m. local time, an air ambulance was dispatched to the scene, which is near Canyon Creek, about 20 kilometres west of the town of Slave Lake.
The chopper crashed about 30 metres offshore in about two metres of water, and attempts to get to the pilot resulted in some emergency crew members being treated for hypothermia.
Officials with the Alberta's Sustainable Resources, which is in charge of the firefighting effort, said that a full internal review will be undertaken, and that the TSB would be leading the investigation. The cause of the crash isn't known yet."
other,"Meanwhile, there are two forms in securities transactions: outright transactions and RP (repurchase agreement) transactions. Outright transactions refer to operations where the central bank buys or sells eligible securities outright on the market. RP transactions are contracts under which the central bank sells (or buys) bonds with the condition that it will buy (or sell) them back after a specified period of time. Outright transactions are conducted only limitedly, since they are employed to provide or absorb liquidity permanently, and they therefore directly affect long-term market rates. For this reason, securities transactions focus mainly on RP transactions (mostly with 7-day maturities). Meanwhile, following the revision of the Bank of Korea Act in August 2011, the Bank can operate a securities lending and borrowing facility, which is enabling the Bank to not only enhance the efficiency of the liquidity management through flexible expansion of the volume of its RP sales, but also cope more effectively in the case of financial turmoil such as a credit crunch.Monetary Stabilization Bonds, issued by the Bank of Korea, have relatively long maturities. They are thus used as a structural adjustment tool whose policy effects are long lasting.Meanwhile, the Monetary Stabilization Account,utilized sinceOctober 2010, is a market-friendly term deposit facility. It is mainly used to fine-tune the reserve levels and to cope with unexpected changes in reserve supply and demand."

In their study, published this month in the journal Nature Food, researchers looked at 5,853 foods in the US diet and measured their effects in minutes of healthy life gained or lost.
""We wanted to make a health-based evaluation of the beneficial and detrimental impacts of the food in the entire diet,"" Olivier Jolliet, professor of environmental health sciences at the university and senior author of the paper, told CNN.
The team came up with an index that calculates the net beneficial or detrimental health burden in minutes of healthy life associated with a serving of food. It's based on a study called the Global Burden of Disease, which measures morbidity associated with a person's food choices.
""For example, 0.45 minutes are lost per gram of processed meat, or 0.1 minutes are gained per gram of fruit. We then look at the composition of each food and then multiplied this number by the corresponding food profiles that we previously developed,"" Jolliet said.
One of the foods researchers measured was a standard beef hot dog on a bun. Its 61 grams of processed meat resulted in the loss of 27 minutes of healthy life, Jolliet said -- but when ingredients like sodium and trans fatty acids were factored in, the final value was 36 minutes lost."
valcano eruption,"Guatemala’s Volcan de Fuego drives thousands from their homes UNHCR is assessing the needs of nearly 13,000 people evacuated after the deadly eruptions that killed at least 110 people. SCUINTLA, Guatemala _ When Guatemala’s Volcan de Fuego erupted with little warning, a cloud of burning gas and ash swallowed up farmer Lucia’s crops. Now displaced and living at a shelter in the town of Escuintla, in the Central American country’s western lowlands, her family’s main concern is for their home which survived the eruption. “My son and husband are sleeping in this temporary shelter and during the day they guard our house from others that could steal our belongings,” says Lucia. She is among 12,784 local residents living on the slopes of the volcano, who have been evacuated since the first deadly eruption nine days ago, which killed at least 110 people, with nearly 200 still missing."
other,"Since the last MPC meeting in August 2018, global economic activity has remained resilient in spite of ongoing trade tensions, but is becoming uneven and the outlook is clouded by several uncertainties. Among advanced economies (AEs), the United States (US) economy appeared to have sustained pace in Q3:2018 as reflected in strong retail sales and robust industrial activity. In the Euro area, economic activity remained subdued due to overall weak economic sentiment, weighed down mainly by political uncertainty. The Japanese economy has so far maintained the momentum of the previous quarter, buoyed by recovering industrial production and strong business optimism.Economic activity in major emerging market economies (EMEs) has been facing headwinds from both global and country-specific factors. In China, industrial production growth has moderated with slowing exports and the ongoing deleveraging of the financial system weighing on growth prospects. The Russian economy has been gathering steam with the manufacturing sector turning around, and the employment scenario remaining upbeat on rising oil prices. In Brazil, economic activity is recovering from the setback in Q2, supported by improving business and consumer sentiment, though weak domestic demand and the sluggish pace of recovery in manufacturing activity point to a slow revival. The South African economy slipped into recession in Q2:2018, pulled down by the negative contribution from agriculture on account of a strong unfavourable base effect.Growth in global trade is weakening as reflected in export orders and automobile production and sales. Crude oil prices eased during the first half of August on concerns of reduced demand from EMEs due mainly to the spillover from country-specific turmoil, and accentuated by rising supplies. However, prices rebounded on expectation of reduced supplies due to sanctions on Iran and falling US stockpiles. Base metal prices witnessed selling pressure in anticipation of weak demand from major economies. Gold prices continued to slide lower on a strong US dollar, though they recovered somewhat on safe-haven demand from the mid-August lows. Inflation remained firm in the US, reflecting tightening labour market and elevated energy prices, while it persisted much below the central bank¡¯s target in Japan. In the Euro area, inflation pressures have been sustained by elevated crude prices. Inflation in many key EMEs has risen on surging crude prices and currency depreciations, caused by a firm dollar and domestic factors."
drought,"One year after Australia’s 16-year drought ‘The Big Dry’ was confirmed to have broken, parts of Queensland and New South Wales were again declared to be in drought. The Bureau of Meteorology recorded rainfall deficiencies between April 2012 and January 2014, with most of Queensland and inland of the Great Dividing Range in New South Wales experiencing serious to severe deficiencies, having less than 70 per cent of their long-term average rainfall.
On 1 April 2013, 13 regional councils, the equivalent of one third of Queensland was covered by drought declarations. This grew to 60 per cent by October 2013 and by March 2014, 80 per cent of Queensland was officially in drought, including all 10 shires in the state’s north-west. As of 1 January 2015, there were 44 entire local government areas and three part local government areas drought declared, with another 78 Individually Droughted Property (IDP) declarations in an additional nine local government areas.
In May 2013, one sixth of New South Wales was in drought and by February 2014, 62 per cent of the state had received no significant rainfall for two years. Graziers experienced falling cattle prices and loss of income, with some having to shoot their stock or move them to other properties in response to deteriorating pasture and water availability.
In November 2013, the New South Wales State Government announced a $7.6 million package of emergency support to farmers in the Bourke, Brewarrina and Walgett councils and in February 2014 that was raised to $14.6 million. In January 2014, the Queensland State Government announced an extra $20 million would be added to the Drought Relief Assistance Scheme, taking the total to $31 million."
valcano eruption,"Thousands return to DRC after Mount Nyiragongo volcano eruption May 23 (UPI) -- Thousands of people who evacuated the Democratic Republic of Congo after the Mount Nyiragongo volcano erupted returned to view the aftermath Sunday. Rwanda's Emergency Management Ministry said that at least 8,000 people crossed the border into the country following the eruption. ""This morning, after lava flows from Nyiragongo volcano have stopped, most of Congolese evacuated to Rubavu are returning back home,"" the ministry said."
other,"Economic growth is likely to be sluggish in the next quarter or so, reflecting uncertainties and weaknesses in the external environment.  A firmer recovery is likely to take hold only in H2 2003.  Inflation is expected to remain low. MAS will therefore maintain the neutral policy stance of a zero percent appreciation for the S$NEER policy path in the period ahead, with no change in the level at which the policy band is centred and in the width of the band.  This policy stance will provide sufficient flexibility to support the recovery in the domestic economy while keeping inflation low."
wildfires,"CONWAY - Horry County Fire and Rescue is taking new preventative measures, which included added facilities, equipment, and training to combat wildfires.
Only one home burned down in the 12,000 or so acres where Horry County Fire and Rescue was working during the 2009 wildfire.
""No other homes were destroyed and you know I think that's a good testament to what we did in the area out there in Horry county,"" said Horry County Fire Chief Gary Aldermann.
Since the 2009 wildfire the county bought equipment better suited for fighting wildfires for its new wildfire hub station, which was built in Conway.
New uniforms and wildfire gear were purchased with federal grant money.
""It (the new uniform) allows them to not go and be as fatigued right away because of the weight of the equipment and the ability to that it breathes better than regular structure fire gear,"" said Aldermann.
Aldermann says money from another federal grant allowed the department to hire 18 more firefighters.
In total, 30 firefighters have gotten advanced training on fighting wildfires and have helped form the Horry County Wildfire Team.
Aldermann says the county is also working to improve communications with the S.C. Forestry Commission and local municipalities."
other,"The nominal GDP (NGDP) gap, a measure of unexpected changes in the dollar size of the US economy, is the percentage difference between the actual and the neutral levels of NGDP. The neutral level of NGDP, in turn, is a sum of all dollar incomes expected by households and businesses coming into a specific time period. In the second quarter of 2021, the NGDP gap was _0.10 percent, down from the _2.11 percent NGDP gap experienced in the first quarter of 2021 (see figures below).The _0.10 percent NGDP gap means that the dollar size of the economy, $22.722 trillion, was very close to the expected $22.746 trillion. This closing of the NGDP gap implies that aggregate spending and income in dollar terms have largely caught up to their prepandemic trend levels.By way of comparison, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) output gap reveals that the real economy was 1.72 percent smaller than its true potential in the second quarter in 2021 (see table). Also, relative to the previous quarter, actual NGDP grew by 3.11 percent (13.01 percent on annualized basis) over the same period. NGDP growth in the second quarter of 2021 picked up compared to the previous quarter and is a key reason that the NGDP gap is close to zero."
other,"Since the beginning of August 2017, yields in the secondary government securities (G-sec) market hardened almost monotonically, driven mostly by domestic factors up to early March 2018 (Chart IV.7). G-sec yields hardened by 20 bps in October mainly due to informal communication by the government in late September that gross fiscal deficit (GFD) could be higher, increase in inflation forecast by the monetary policy committee (MPC) on October 4 and concerns over increase in the supply of papers in the form of bank recapitalisation bonds announced on October 24, 2017. G-Sec yields hardened by 20 bps during November 2017 partly due to fiscal concerns.2 Moody¡¯s rating upgrade on November 17, 2017 and the cancellation of open market sales scheduled for November 23, provided transient relief to the market. In December, the upside tilt in the balance of risks set out in the resolution of the MPC on December 6, concerns about rising inflation following December 12 release of inflation print and the communication on December 27, 2017 that fiscal slippage will be funded by additional market borrowings by the central government led to a rise in yields by 27 bps. Among global factors, rising international crude prices through the quarter and the increase of 25 basis points in the federal funds target on December 13, 2017 meeting of the FOMC pushed up the G-sec yields. On the whole, G-sec yields rose by 67 bps during Q3:2017-18. Over the same period, US yields rose by 8 bps.In Q4, notwithstanding the announcement of reduction of additional borrowings by the central government by _300 billion (from the amount of _500 billion extra borrowing announced in December) on January 17, 2018, the upward pressure on yields resumed from mid-January as still elevated crude prices and spillovers from episodes of global bond sell-off accentuated fears of oversupply of domestic paper. These fears materialised with the fiscal slippage announced in the Union Budget on February 1. Yields traded with a tightening bias till early March, scaling a two-year peak of 7.81 per cent on March 5, 2018. However, yields softened sharply by around 45 bps thereafter due to the lower inflation print for February released on March 12 and the decision by the Government not to front-load its borrowings in H1:2018-19 which resulted in a sharp fall in G-sec yields of 29 bps in a single day on March 27, 2018. As a result, the 10-year yield softened by 7 bps in Q4:2017-18 as against a rise of 36 bps in US yields.Reflecting these developments, the yield curve underwent level shifts through the second half of 2017-18, including in respect of the new benchmark paper issued on January 5, 2018 (Chart IV.8). An empirical analysis suggests that the sensitivity of bond yields in India to global factors represented by the US bond yield has declined in the recent period (although it has risen gradually since Q3), while its responsiveness to domestic factors has increased. Time-varying parameter estimates indicate that the effect of inflation on bond yields in India has increased significantly, especially since August 2017 (Chart IV.9)3."
Typhoon,"A strong typhoon was heading toward the southern Philippines on Monday, and hundreds of people were evacuating coastal areas in the storm's path.
Fishermen and ships were warned not to venture out to sea.
Typhoon Bopha is expected to hit land Tuesday morning but would not directly hit Manila if it stays on its current path, government weather forecaster Jori Loiz said.
The storm has sustained winds of 175 kilometers per hour (109 miles per hour) and gusts of up to 210 kph (130 mph). Its center was 550 kilometers (342 miles) southeast of Surigao del Sur province's Hinatuan township Monday morning. It is moving at 24 kph (15 mph).
Hundreds of residents of islands and other high-risk areas in Surigao del Sur have been asked to go to evacuation centers to avert casualties, Office of Civil Defense regional official Amado Posas said. Classes have been suspended, dump trucks have been readied to ferry more residents when needed, he added.
Posas said some residents have been reluctant to leave their homes because the province was sunny Monday morning. It was not yet clear how many have already evacuated, but he said an estimated 600 to 800 people were ordered to evacuate from islands in the archipelago nation.
Benito Ramos, who heads the government's disaster response agency, says provincial officials have placed food packs and other emergency equipment in areas where the typhoon may pass."
wildfires,"The death toll from the most destructive fire to hit California rose to 23 on Saturday as rescue workers recovered more bodies of people killed by the devastating blaze.
Firefighters are battling raging fires at both ends of the state, but there is little hope of containing the flames anytime soon.
""Today, 14 additional bodies were located, which brings our total number to 23,"" Sheriff Kory Honea told a news conference.
Ten of the bodies were found in the town of Paradise while four were discovered in the Concow area, both in Butte County, Honea said.
Rescuers could be seen removing remains over a period of several hours in Paradise and placing them in a black hearse. Pieces of bodies were transported by bucket, while intact remains were carried in body bags.
So far, a total of 19 of the people killed in what authorities have dubbed the ""Camp Fire"" have been reported in Paradise, where more than 6,700 buildings -- most of them residences -- have been consumed by the late-season inferno.
From miles around, acrid smoke could be seen in the sky around Paradise, the sun barely visible. On the ground, cars were reduced to metal carcasses, while power lines were also gnawed by the flames.
Locals fled the danger, but police told AFP some farmers returned to check on their cattle.
""The magnitude of destruction we have seen is really unbelievable and heartbreaking, and our hearts go to everybody who has been affected by this,"" said Mark Ghilarducci, the director of the California Office of Emergency Services.
Governor-elect Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency to provide assistance to the hardest-hit areas in the fire-prone state.
The fast-moving Camp Fire blaze in the north broke out early Thursday.
Fanned by strong winds, it has so far scorched 100,000 acres (40,500 hectares) and is 20 percent contained, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said Saturday. So far, three of the more than 3,200 firefighters deployed have been injured.
They estimate they will need three weeks to fully contain the blaze.
Local power authorities have told state officials an outage occurred near the spot where the fire erupted, The Sacramento Bee reported, but there is still no official cause of the Camp Fire blaze.
Trump, who was in France for World War I commemorations, drew criticism online for his somewhat unsympathetic reaction to the devastation earlier on Saturday.
""There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor,"" Trump tweeted.
""Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!"""
other,"Let me now turn to the mechanics of how we intend to normalize the stance and conduct of monetary policy when a decision is eventually made to raise the target range for the federal funds rate. Last September, the FOMC issued its statement on Policy Normalization Principles and Plans. This statement provides information about the Committee's likely approach to raising short-term interest rates and reducing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings. As is always the case in setting policy, the Committee will determine the timing and pace of policy normalization so as to promote its statutory mandate to foster maximum employment and price stability.The FOMC intends to adjust the stance of monetary policy during normalization primarily by changing its target range for the federal funds rate and not by actively managing the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. The Committee is confident that it has the tools it needs to raise short-term interest rates when it becomes appropriate to do so and to maintain reasonable control of the level of short-term interest rates as policy continues to firm thereafter, even though the level of reserves held by depository institutions is likely to diminish only gradually. The primary means of raising the federal funds rate will be to increase the rate of interest paid on excess reserves. The Committee also will use an overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility and other supplementary tools as needed to help control the federal funds rate. As economic and financial conditions evolve, the Committee will phase out these supplementary tools when they are no longer needed.The Committee intends to reduce its securities holdings in a gradual and predictable manner primarily by ceasing to reinvest repayments of principal from securities held by the Federal Reserve. It is the Committee's intention to hold, in the longer run, no more securities than necessary for the efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy, and that these securities be primarily Treasury securities.

Typhoon,"_ giant typhoon, churning with winds of more than 230 mph, descended on the central Philippines this morning, killing at least four people and leaving thousands more homeless and without electricity.
The speed of the storm may have ultimately been the country's salvation, as Typhoon Haiyan quickly blew across the island nation rather than sitting over land to wreak havoc.
The typhoon_ade landfall at 4:40 a.m. local time near Guiuan, on the Philippine island of Samar, about 405 miles southeast of the country's capital, Manila.
At least four people have been killed, according to local media. Two people were electrocuted in storm-related accidents, one person was killed by a fallen tree, and another was struck by lightning.
More than 748,000 people have already been evacuated to the 644 evacuation centers across the country. Government officials said more than 3,000 are stranded in ports.
The U.S. Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Center said shortly before the typhoon made landfall that its maximum sustained winds were 195 mph, with gusts up to 235 mph.
The world's strongest recorded hurricane, typhoon or cyclone to previously make landfall was Hurricane Camille of 1969, which roared ashore with 190 mph winds in Mississippi. Haiyan's sustained winds easily make it a category 5 hurricane.
The Philippines government weather bureau said Haiyan had sustained winds of 147 miles per hour, with gusts of 170 mph when it made landfall."
other,"Shares of Chinese companies listed in the US have seen their biggest two-day fall since the 2008 financial crisis.
The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index, which follows the 98 biggest US-listed Chinese stocks, has fallen by almost 15% in the last two trading sessions.
The index has now plummeted by more than 45% since hitting a record high in February.
The slump comes after a series of crackdowns by Beijing on its technology and education industries.
This has led to around $770bn (£556bn) being wiped off the value of US-listed Chinese stocks in the last five months alone.
The latest blow came as Beijing unveiled a massive overhaul of China's $120bn private tutoring sector, under which all institutions offering tuition on school curricula will be registered as non-profit organisations.
The new rules also said: ""Curriculum subject-tutoring institutions are not allowed to go public for financing; listed companies should not invest in the institutions, and foreign capital is barred from such institutions.""
That pushed down the stock market value of private education firms in the US, Hong Kong and mainland China.
Chinese authorities are also cracking down on a wide range of online services from food delivery apps to music streaming platforms.
On Monday, China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) issued new rules aimed at improving the employment conditions of delivery workers.
The SAMR called for delivery workers to be paid at least the minimum wage, have their workload eased, and be given better training.
Meituan, which runs one of China's biggest food delivery apps, saw its shares lose a record 17.6% on Tuesday in Hong Kong trade, on top of a 14% slide the previous day.
Shares in Tencent fell by another 9% on Tuesday in Hong Kong after China ordered the technology giant to end exclusive music licensing deals with major record labels around the world.
Regulators said the move was aimed at tackling the company's dominance of online music streaming in the country.
And earlier this year, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba accepted a record $2.8bn fine after an official investigation found that it had abused its market position for years."
other,"The Bank of England¡¯s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. In that context, its challenge at present is to respond to the economic and financial impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. At its meeting ending on 4 August 2020, the MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.1%. The Committee voted unanimously for the Bank of England to continue with its existing programmes of UK government bond and sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, maintaining the target for the total stock of these purchases at ¡ê745 billion.The Committee¡¯s projections for activity and inflation are set out in the accompanying August Monetary Policy Report. Although recent developments suggest a less weak starting point for the Committee¡¯s latest projections, it is unclear how informative they are about how the economy will perform further out. The outlook for the UK and global economies remains unusually uncertain. It will depend critically on the evolution of the pandemic, measures taken to protect public health, and how governments, households and businesses respond to these factors. The MPC¡¯s projections assume that the direct impact of Covid-19 on the economy dissipates gradually over the forecast period. Given the inherent uncertainties regarding the evolution of the pandemic, the MPC¡¯s medium-term projections are a less informative guide than usual."
other,"To summarise, aggregate demand is expected to improve in 2018-19, supported, inter alia, by the improving GST implementation, the recapitalisation of public sector banks and the resolution of distressed assets under the IBC. Rural and infrastructure sectors are identified as thrust areas in the Union Budget, which could energise aggregate demand. With the acceleration in global trade, the Indian economy could benefit from buoyant external demand. In addition to the usual monsoon related uncertainty, inflation faces upside risks from a variety of other sources, especially due to the oil prices, the fiscal slippage, and (the statistical effect from) the expected increases in HRAs by the state governments, The purely direct statistical impact of the HRA adjustment on CPI will be looked through while formulating monetary policy. Uncertainty over the pace and timing of monetary policy normalisation by the systemic central banks in advanced economies, protectionist tendencies and fears of a trade war pose significant risks to the baseline inflation and growth paths."
valcano eruption,"White Island Eruption Leaves 1 Lost Life, 27 Missing Person Reports White Island, the most active volcano in New Zealand, erupted in the early afternoon of December 9. A volcanic eruption in New Zealand had claimed a life and left at least 27 people reported missing. Known as the country's most active volcano, Whakaari has erupted on Monday early afternoon, sending a huge cloud of ash and affecting at least 50 island visitors. An American tourist, Michael Schade, told BBC that he was at the crater just a few minutes before the eruption. Then, when he was riding on a boat that was leaving the island after the morning tour ended, someone pointed the ash piling up from the volcano. He said it was an experience that will be ""hard to believe."" But the boat he was in returned to the island and rescued as many people as they can. One of them, which his mom tended to, is among to those who are in critical condition. A touring party of at least 38 people from the Ovation of the Seas also has not yet returned, according to Kevin O'Sullivan, the chief executive officer of the New Zealand Cruise Association."
other,"The Fed, as the nation¡¯s monetary policy authority, influences the availability and cost of money and credit to promote a healthy economy. Congress has given the Fed two coequal goals for monetary policy: first, maximum employment; and, second, stable prices, meaning low, stable inflation. This ¡°dual mandate¡± implies a third, lesser-known goal of moderate long-term interest rates.The Fed¡¯s interpretations of its maximum employment and stable prices goals have changed over time as the economy has evolved. For example, during the long expansion after the Great Recession of 2007_2009, labor market conditions became very strong and yet did not trigger a significant rise in inflation. Accordingly, the Fed de-emphasized its prior concern about employment possibly exceeding its maximum level, focusing instead only on shortfalls of employment below its maximum level. In this newer interpretation, formalized in the FOMC¡¯s August 2020 ¡°Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,¡± high employment and low unemployment do not raise concerns for the FOMC as long as they are not accompanied by unwanted increases in inflation or the emergence of other risks that could threaten attainment of the dual mandate goals.More generally, maximum employment is a broad-based and inclusive goal that is not directly measurable and is affected by changes in the structure and dynamics of the labor market. So, the Fed doesn¡¯t specify a fixed goal for employment. Its assessments of the shortfalls of employment from its maximum level rest on a wide range of indicators and are necessarily uncertain. Intuitively, though, when the economy is at maximum employment, anyone who wants a job can get one. And recent estimates of the longer-run rate of unemployment that is consistent with maximum employment are generally around 4 percent.Fed policymakers judge that a 2 percent inflation rate, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with its mandate for stable prices. The Fed began explicitly stating the 2 percent goal in 2012. In its 2020 ¡°Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,¡± the FOMC changed that goal to inflation that averages 2 percent over time, in contrast to aiming for 2 percent at any given time. So, following periods when inflation has persisted below 2 percent, the Fed strives for inflation to be moderately above 2 percent for some time."
drought,"The mighty Rio Grande is looking less mighty as U.S. forecasters predict spring flows will be less than half of average — or worse — and that signals potential trouble for the already stressed waterway.
One of the longest rivers in North America, the Rio Grande delivers drinking water and irrigation supplies to millions of people from southern Colorado into Texas and Mexico under a decades-old water-sharing agreement. With more dry years than wet ones over the last two decades, how much water ends up flowing downstream has been a point of contention among the states.
As New Mexico and Texas battle over their shares before the U.S. Supreme Court, forecasters with the federal government’s Natural Resources Conservation Service say river and stream flows across New Mexico have dropped noticeably following a somewhat dry March.
The models show drought is expected to keep its hold over the mountains along the New Mexico-Colorado border that feed the Rio Grande, while California, Nevada and other southwestern states aren’t likely to see a reprieve from dry conditions through June."

Residents inVancouver’s mainland felt the intense quake with smaller tremors reaching the Greater Vancouver Area. Peopleas far as Edmonton, Alberta also reportedly feelingaftershocks well into Sunday. Tremors are expected to continue for days but many will go unnoticed.
The quake prompted a number of tsunami warnings along the province’s coastand as far away as Hawaii and California, but all were called off Sunday.
Still no reports of injuries or significant damages have been reported aside from personal belongings broken and misplaced from the tremors.
Tsunami warnings were issued for a large stretch of the North and Central coast, as well as the Haida Gwaii region. These Tsunami warnings prompted some residents to evacuate their homes. Haida Gwaii and other coastal communities such as Tofino sought out higher ground.
All of the warnings affecting British Columbia’s coastline were called off at about 3:22 a.m. Sunday in a bulletin from the U.S. National Weather Service’s West Coast/Alaska Tsunami Warning Center."
Typhoon,"A typhoon caused deadly mudslides that buried people and destroyed homes on a Japanese island yesterday before sweeping up the Pacific coast, grounding hundreds of flights and disrupting Tokyo's transportation during the morning rush. At least 17 deaths were reported and nearly 50 people were missing.
Hardest hit from Typhoon Wipha was Izu Oshima island, which is about 120 kilometres (75 miles) south of Tokyo. Rescuers found 16 bodies, most of them buried by mudslides, police and town officials said. Dozensof homes were destroyed, and about 45 people were missing.
A woman from Tokyo died after falling into a river and being washed 10 kilometres (6 miles) downriver to Yokohama, police said. Two sixth-grade boys and another person were missing on Japan's main island, Honshu, the Fire and Disaster Management Agency said.
More than 350 homes were damaged or destroyed, including 283 on Izu Oshima, it said.
The typhoon, which stayed offshore in the Pacific, had sustained winds of 126 kilometres per hour (78 miles per hour), with gusts up to 180 kph (110 mph), before it was downgraded to a tropical storm.
More than 80 centimetres (30 inches) of rain fell on Izu Oshima during a 24-hour period ending yesterday morning, the most since record-keeping began in 1991."

other,"President Joe Biden has said repeatedly over the past four months -- as recently as last week -- that he refuses to hand off the war in Afghanistan to a fifth US president.
Implicit in that statement is the belief the war shouldn't have been passed to him, nearly 20 years after it began.
Each president since 2001 has confronted an evolving mission in Afghanistan, one that resulted in tens of thousands American and Afghan casualties, frustratingly futile attempts to improve the country's political leadership and a Taliban that stubbornly refused defeat.
Biden has explained his decision to withdraw all US troops as a necessary choice for a war whose purpose had become blurred, adding that it was set in motion by a deal with the Taliban made by President Donald Trump. The chaos that ensued in evacuating Americans and Afghans who assisted the war effort was a predictable and mostly unavoidable outcome, he said last week.
Still, the scenes of rushed departures from Kabul and the Taliban's takeover of the country have proved deeply humbling for a global superpower that spent billions of dollars and lost thousands of lives in its efforts.
How America spent 20 years in Afghanistan, only to have the Taliban resume control again as its troops withdrew, will be a topic for historians to ponder for decades. And who ultimately bears responsibility is a complicated debate."
drought,"Around 330 million people in India are affected by drought, according to the government.
The Marathwada region in India’s western Maharashtra state is badly affected, reeling under the worst drought in decades.
Around 400km from Mumbai, the region has been getting insufficient rains for the past three years.
Temperatures are in the low 40Cs in some areas, with others only cooling to 38C at night. It is worse for the poor in rural areas, who are forced to drink whatever water they can.
In 2015, the region received only 49 percent of what is considered a normal amount of rainfall.
Some parts received even less: a meagre 35 percent of normal rainfall.
Trains loaded with water are being moved across the country, but farmers’ wells are drying up and drinking water is being rationed.
Arriving almost daily, each train brings millions of litres of water to this drought-stricken area. But even this is not enough.
“It’s not helped much because we only got it once before in the past 15 days,” a village resident told Al Jazeera.

flood,"Increasing number of flood victims in Sabah and Sarawak, Melaka recovers KUALA LUMPUR, May 21 — The floods in Sabah and Sarawak are still registering increases with Sabah recording 2,834 victims this evening compared to 1,447 this morning while Sarawak recorded 373 victims this evening compared to 350 this morning.  All the flood victims in Sabah were housed in 21 temporary flood relief centres (PPS).  The Sabah Disaster Management Committee, in a statement this morning, said Tenom is still the worst-hit district with 2,363 victims this evening compared to 1,149 victims this morning while the number of flood victims in Beaufort rose to 471 compared to 294 people this morning. Ten PPS were opened in Tenom this evening bringing the number of PPS opened in the district to 19 while one PPS had just been opened in Beaufort bringing the number of PPS opened in the district to two."
other,"Presently, the Reserve Bank provides Rupee liquidity to market participants through the Repo/Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) window against eligible collateral. An initial margin of 4 per cent and 6 per cent is currently applied on Central Government Securities (including T-bills) and State Development Loans (SDLs) respectively, submitted as collaterals by participants in Repo/MSF. Since the margin requirement is similar for all eligible securities irrespective of residual maturity, the prevailing system does not differentiate the market risk across securities.On a review and in line with international standards, it has been decided to require ¡ª starting August 1, 2018 ¡ª initial margin on collateral on the basis of its residual maturity. The initial margin requirement for Central Government Securities would be in the range of 0.5 per cent to 4 per cent in five different buckets of residual maturity. The initial margin requirement in case of SDLs would be in the range of 2.5 per cent to 6.0 per cent for the same maturity buckets. With a view to incentivising the State Governments to get SDLs a public rating, it has been decided that the initial margin requirement for rated SDLs shall be set at 1.0 per cent lower than that of other SDLs for the same maturity buckets, i.e., in the range of 1.5 per cent to 5.0 per cent. A circular in this regard will be issued today."
drought,"Severe drought has caused California's reservoirs to run low, with Lake Oroville expected to reach a record low later this summer. Nearly three-quarters of the state is suffering from the extreme dry spell, with other areas facing a dire water supply situation and fears of wildfires.
Each year, Lake Oroville helps water a quarter of the nation's crops and sustain endangered salmon beneath its dam. However, the lake is seen to be shrinking at a surprising speed amid a severe drought.
According to AP, state officials are forecasting it will reach a record low as hot summer looms.
If the lake drops below 195 m (640 feet), which is possible by late August, officials would have to close down a major power plant for the second time ever due to low water levels that will strain the electrical grid during the hottest part of summer. The lake's record low is 197 m (646 feet).
While dry spells are common in California, this year is much drier than the previous seasons, with waters quickly evaporating from reservoirs.
At Lake Shasta, for instance, water levels ran low that campers have occupied dusty riverbanks.
More than 1 500 dams across the state are running 50 percent lower than they should be this time of the year, said Jay Lund, co-director of the Center for Watershed Sciences at the University of California-Davis. 
As of Tuesday, June 1, 2021, the state Department of Water Resources reported that 154 major dams across the state were 66 percent of average and the snow water equivalent for the snowpack was zero percent of normal for June 1.
In Butte County, the dry situation is raising concern among residents. In 2018, the county suffered the deadliest U.S. wildfire in a century when 85 people died. In 2020, another 16 people died in fires."
drought,"Across northern China swathes of land are dry, parched by drought.
In some areas these are the driest conditions in a lifetime. Snowfalls in recent days have helped a little, but still, across huge areas of land, water is in short supply.
The countryside is dotted with empty dams. Standing on top of one, near Qufu in Shandong Province, you can see just a tiny muddy pool in the centre of a dam that is hundreds of metres long.
Sitting rusting on the earth is a small boat. Along the dry dam floor people have been planting rows of crops because it has been like this for so long.
Li Si Jiao, 77, his back stooped with age, shuffles slowly along a path on top of the dam. His face is weathered and creased with lines. He gestures at the dam and says the water used to stretch all the way to the village in the distance, but no more.
This is China's breadbasket, the heart of its grain growing lands, and all around are Shandong's wheat fields. They are full of lines of seedlings, sprouting from the ground, but wilting and yellowing.
A grey, polluted haze hangs in the air. Every few hundred yards small groups of men and women are working to try to save their crops from the drought.
China is the world's biggest grower and consumer of wheat. In normal years it is self-sufficient. But if it has to import grain this year then that will have an impact far afield.
Already just the warnings of a possible shortfall in China's crop have put pressure on global wheat prices."
wildfires,"Emergency crews continued to battle a fast-moving wildfire in Alaska on Monday, as flames swept across 6,500 acres early in the morning.
Additional firefighters from the Lower 48 states were called in to assist local crews in battling the Sockeye Fire, which is burning along the Parks Highway in the town of Willow, about 81 miles north of Anchorage. Ongoing hot, dry weather and a lack of rain and moisture in the area are exacerbating the conditions, fire officials said.
Crews are focused on evacuating residents and saving homes, while planes are flying overhead to drop water onto the blaze.
Authorities have not yet estimated the number of damaged structures."
earthquake,"7.5 magnitude earthquake near Alaska triggers tsunami warning A tsunami warning was issued for southern Alaska on Monday after a major earthquake and large aftershock hit near the Alaskan Peninsula. The warning was later downgraded to an advisory by the National Weather Service. An initial earthquake with a 7.5 magnitude occurred around Sand Point, Alaska, a city on one of the Shumagin Islands, just before 1 p.m. local time (5 p.m. E.T.), according to the Official U.S. Geological Survey. An aftershock hit the area about 20 minutes later at a magnitude of 5.8, the USGS said. The National Weather Service issued a tsunami warning for the Pacific coasts from Kennedy Entrance, Alaska to Unimak Pass, Alaska. Police in Homer, Alaska, asked anyone in the potential flooding zone to move to higher ground immediately in fear of a potential tsunami. Sand Point, where the earthquake appears to have originated, is about 575 nautical miles southwest of Anchorage. The city is on Popof Island, one of 20 islands in the Aleutians East Borough south of the mainland. USGS data showed at least eight aftershocks in the hour after the first quake, including five that measured between 5.2 and 5.9 in magnitude. A powerful 7.8-magnitude earthquake hit Alaska in July, also triggering fears of a possible tsunami wave. That quake happened at 10:13 p.m., roughly 75 miles south of the community of Chignik."
other,"International financial markets have been lifted by improving global growth prospects, broadly accommodative monetary policy stances of systemic central banks and generally positive incoming data. Increasingly, financial markets have shown resilience to geo-political events and have swiftly priced them in. This has been reflected in the reinvigoration of the reach for returns. Country-specific factors have modulated investor sentiment. Equity markets in most AEs have gained in Q2, surpassing past peaks in the US; boosted by corporate profits in Japan; and supported by easing political tensions and upbeat data in the case of the Euro area. In EMEs, equities have turned in a mixed performance, with high valuations across Asia, but weaker in Latin America on softer commodity prices. Bond yields in major AEs have been largely range-bound. In EMEs, yields have hardened in the few countries facing inflation pressures and political uncertainties, but for commodity exporters, there has been some recent decline. In the currency markets, the US dollar has weakened in May after dovish guidance by the Fed and unexpected political events. Since mid-May, the yen has shed its depreciating bias and appears to have gained safe haven appeal. EME currencies, which had depreciated on the strength of the US dollar, have steadied more recently on renewal of capital flows and risk-on investor appetite.On May 31, 2017 India¡¯s Central Statistics Office (CSO) released quarterly estimates of national income accounts for Q4 of 2016-17, provisional estimates for 2016-17 and revisions for the preceding five years. The growth of real gross value added (GVA) for 2016-17 has been pegged at 6.6 per cent, 0.1 percentage point lower than the second advance estimates released in February 2017. Underlying the revision is a downward adjustment in services sector growth in Q4 for the constituents of construction, financial and professional services, and real estate. Estimates of agriculture and allied activities have been upgraded to incorporate the all-time high production of foodgrains and horticulture in the year. GVA in industry has also been placed higher in the provisional estimates relative to the earlier reading to reflect the impact of new indices of industrial production (IIP) and wholesale prices (WPI) rebased to 2011-12. The new data reveal that a slowdown in activity in both industry and services set in as early as Q1 of 2016-17 and became pronounced in Q4. Moreover, the deceleration of activity coursing through the year has had underlying drivers that have been in operation since Q2. Components of aggregate demand reflect a contraction in gross fixed investment in Q4, reversing the turnaround evident in the second half of the year in the advance estimates. This is also reflected in the contraction in the production of capital goods in the new IIP. However, private final consumption expenditure recorded robust year-on-year growth.On May 9, the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) released its third advance estimates of foodgrains production, which confirmed the record level of output achieved in 2016-17 and, in fact, revised it upwards to 273 million tonnes. The MoA also set out its second advance estimates of fruits and vegetables on May 30, which was also a historical record. Benefiting from the bumper harvest, rabi procurement during Q1 of 2017-18 so far has been significantly higher than a year ago, replenishing food stocks and taking them to 61.9 million tonnes in May 2017, three times the buffer norm. On June 6, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) re-affirmed its forecast of a normal and well-distributed south-west (June-September) monsoon, which augurs well for the agricultural outlook."

wildfires,"Firefighters in Australia are struggling to contain a massive bushfire on Fraser Island, one of the country's most popular tourist spots.
The fire has been raging through the Unesco World Heritage site off the east coast for six weeks, destroying large swathes of its unique forests.
Travel there was stopped on Friday and guests at the island's largest resort are being evacuated.
It comes as south-east Australia is experiencing a blistering heatwave.
On Fraser Island, just north of Brisbane off the eastern coast of the state of Queensland, there are fears that the high temperatures - forecast to reach up to 34C (93F) in the region in the coming days - will further fuel the blaze.
Firefighters are also being hindered by limited access to the bushfire on the island's remote north.
Authorities say the fire is burning on two fronts, with the island shrouded in smoke."
drought,"Some 400 delegates from across Africa and beyond have come together in Windhoek, Namibia for the first African Drought Conference. International and African leaders and experts are set to find solutions to the recurring drought events and their associated impacts.
The principal objective of the conference is for African countries to come up with an overarching strategic framework for Africa that will enhance drought resilience  and promote a paradigm shift from ‘reactive’ to ‘proactive’ drought management. 
The conference is organized by the Namibian Ministry of Environment and Tourism supported by UNCCD in partnership with a number of international organizations and countries. 
The conference which is taking place from August 15 – 19 is split between technical segment (15 – 17 August) and a high level segment (18-19 August).
The African Drought Conference was launched under the chairmanship of Minister Pohamba and with the presence of Namibian deputy Prime Minister and Minister in charge of international cooperation, the minister of Agriculture, the AUC commissioner for rural economy and agriculture, the UN resident coordinator and other officials. Many African countries, IO, CSOs, etc. Mr. Daniel Tsegai is delivering a speech on behalf of UNCCD Secretariat."
other,"The global economic situation is continuing to provide a favourable environment for the Australian economy. Most regions of the world are experiencing good economic growth this year, with the United States and China in particular performing strongly. There has been a notable improvement in conditions in Japan, where spending by businesses and consumers has strengthened and there has been good progress in winding back the balance sheet excesses that had hampered growth in the past. Elsewhere, solid growth is being recorded in the east Asian region and in the emerging economies of Eastern Europe and Latin America, with the euro area the only significant weak spot at present. Overall the world economy is likely to record a further year of above-average growth in 2005, and most observers expect this to continue next year.A lot of attention over the past couple of years has focused on the upward trend in oil prices and its effects on the global economy. While periodic disruptions to supply have at times contributed to this trend, the main cause has been the strength of world demand. In these circumstances, higher oil prices do not appear to have had a significant contractionary effect on the world economy, and observers have not generally been scaling back their expectations of future world growth during the period when oil prices have been rising. The main macroeconomic effects to date can be seen in higher headline inflation figures around the world, most notably in the United States. As yet, there has been little evidence of any significant second-round inflationary effects, and at this stage core inflation rates in most advanced countries remain contained."

In fact, the quake triggered a small tsunami, which reached maximum wave heights of less than a meter: In Lenakel (Vanuatu), 0.78 m waves above tide were measured, 75 cm on the Great Barrier Island (New Zealand), 48 cm at Kingston Norfolk Island, and 10-20 cm in various coastal locations of New Caledonia. There are no reports of damages."
Typhoon,"Experts say Typhoon Haiyan was about as strong as it could theoretically get when it swept through the Philippines, killing thousands of people and driving hundreds of thousands from their homes. But intensity limits have been rising over decades past — and climate models suggest they will keep rising over the decades to come, with the potential for bigger and more devastating storms.
""The tragedy of this particular storm is that it reached its limit just about the time it made landfall,"" Kerry Emanuel, a climate scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told NBC News.
Based on satellite imagery, the U.S. military's Joint Typhoon Warning Center estimated that Haiyan's winds reached a sustained peak as high as 195 mph shortly before it made landfall, with gusts rising to 235 mph. Estimates from Philippine weather officials were lower, suggesting that the storm packed sustained winds of 147 mph and gusts of 170 mph when it hit land. Either way, the typhoon ranks among the world's strongest tropical storms and appears to have been more powerful than Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
If the higher estimates are correct, the warning center said Haiyan's maximum strength would exceed that of its previous record-holder: Hurricane Camille, which hit the northern Gulf Coast in 1969 with sustained winds of 190 mph.
""This is at the top end of any tropical system that we've seen on our planet,"" said Bryan Norcross, The Weather Channel's hurricane specialist.
The definition of that top end has been shifting, Emanuel said. He was part of a team of researchers who predicted climate change could make tropical storms more intense, particularly in the Pacific.
""That part of the ocean, the Western Pacific, in November is pretty juicy,"" he said. ""It has a high thermodynamic limit. That limit has been going up in time, perhaps in response to global warming. It's a little hard to say that for sure."" 
Although the maximum intensity of tropical storms is projected to rise, the climate models suggest a scenario that's more complex than merely turning up the dials. ""It doesn't mean there'll be more storms,"" Emanuel said. ""In fact, the weaker storms might be less frequent, but it's not the weaker storms that do the damage. In the end, we're much more concerned about what happens at the high end. It's those guys that do all the terrible destruction."""
Typhoon,"The eastern United States is bracing itself for the first heavy storm of the season, with torrential downpour and snow expected from Tennessee to Michigan on Monday, and rain then drenching neighbouring regions.
The storm is expected to form over the deep south on Sunday, with heavy rain.  
Strong to severe thunderstorms could also develop in the warm, humid air ahead of the storm from the southeast on Sunday to the eastern Mid-Atlantic on Monday.
It will then race across the US on Monday, leaving snow in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia and high elevations in western North Carolina.
The storm will be accompanied by high winds, causing drifting snow."
wildfires,"The amount of land burned by wildfires in the U.S. this year has surpassed 9 million acres, according to data released Thursday by the National Interagency Fire Center.
This is only the fourth time on record the country has reached the 9 million-acre mark, center spokesman Randall Eardley said in an e-mail. The area burned is roughly equivalent to the size of New Jersey and Connecticut combined.
All of the top years for acres burned have occurred since 2000, Eardley said. The worst year occurred in 2006, with 9.8 million acres. In 2007 and 2012, 9.3 million acres were burned, he said. If another 800,000 acres are burned this year, an all-time record would be set.
Accurate wildfire records go back to 1960. Prior to 2000, the U.S. surpassed 7 million acres only one time — in 1963. ""The year 2000 seems to have been a turning point in the number of acres we've seen burned,"" Eardley said.
This year's fire season has been unusually severe in the Northwest. Wildfires there destroyed dozens of homes and forced hundreds of residents to evacuate, sometimes for weeks on end."
other,"Economic activity in the United States expanded at a moderate rate in the second half of 2011 following an anemic gain in the first half, and the moderate pace of expansion appears to have continued into the opening months of 2012. Activity was held down in the first half of 2011 by temporary factors, particularly supply chain disruptions stemming from the earthquake in Japan and the damping effect of higher energy prices on consumer spending. As the effects of these factors waned over the second half of the year, economic activity picked up. Conditions in the labor market have improved since last summer, with an increase in the pace of job gains and a noticeable reduction in the unemployment rate. Meanwhile, consumer price inflation has stepped down from the temporarily high levels observed over the first half of 2011, as commodity and import prices retreated and as longer-term inflation expectations remained stable. Looking ahead, growth is likely to be modest during the coming year, as several factors appear likely to continue to restrain activity, including restricted access to credit for many households and small businesses, the still-depressed housing market, tight fiscal policy at all levels of government, and some slowing in global economic growth."
drought,"Namibia is facing a ""natural disaster"" because of poor rains, President Hage Geingob says.
He has declared a state of emergency - the second in three years - over the situation, mobilising all government agencies to respond to the drought.
The lack of rain has already left 500,000 people - one in five Namibians - without access to enough food, the government says.
The sparsely-populated country has seen a succession of droughts since 2013.
The government had set aside 40m (30m) to buy food and water tanks, and to transport livestock to and from grazing areas.
Prime Minister Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila has appealed for international help.
""We... call on all Namibians and development partners to assist in any way possible, so that we provide to our people who are affected, as well as the livestock,"" she said in the national assembly.
At least 60,000 domestic animals have died in the past six months.
Those affected are facing severe food shortages following the prolonged drought, the prime ministers's office, which is coordinating the response, has said.
President Geingob blamed a poor rainy season, which is usually comes between January and March, for being behind the problem.
Rivers have dried up in the north of the country, and people are depending on food and water relief from the government, journalist Tuyeimo Haidula told the BBC.
Livestock have been worst affected by the drought, she said.
Information and Communication Minister, Stanley Simataa, has asked farmers to reduce livestock to reasonable numbers that they can build when the situation changes, national broadcaster NBC reports.
The vast mineral-rich southern African nation imports around 70% of its food from neighbouring South Africa.
Its expansive arid geography makes it difficult to grow crops for subsistence use."
earthquake,"A 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck Saturday off the coast of Antarctica, with authorities issuing a tsunami warning for Chile's Eduardo Frei base on the frigid continent, emergency officials said.
The quake struck at 8:36 pm (2336 GMT) about 210 kilometers (130 miles) east of the base at a depth of 10 kilometers (6 miles), Chile's National Emergency Office (Onemi) said, urging evacuation from ""the beach area of the Antarctic"" ahead of a possible tsunami.
The Chilean Air Force's base is the country's largest in Antarctica, and includes a village, hospital, school, bank, post office and chapel.
The maximum population in summer is 150 people, and the average population in winter is 80.
An unrelated 5.9-magnitude earthquake struck near Santiago on Saturday night, but Onemi said no significant damage or impact was reported.
Chile is one of the most seismically active countries in the world. A 8.8-magniture temblor in the city of Concepcion on February 27, 2010 left more than 500 dead.
The country suffered the most powerful earthquake ever recorded 60 years ago -- measuring 9.6 magnitude -- in the city of Valdivia."
other,"In its April 2019 Monetary Policy Statement, MAS maintained the rate of appreciation of the S$NEER policy band. There was also no change to the width of the policy band or the level at which it was centred. This policy stance was assessed to be appropriate, given contained inflationary pressures and a narrowing of the positive output gap.Over the last six months, the S$NEER has fluctuated within the upper half of the policy band, reflecting shifts in global risk sentiment and capital inflows into Singapore. The three-month S$ SIBOR edged up from 1.9% in end-April 2019 to 2.0% in end-June, before falling back to 1.9% in August, where it has remained as at end-September."
other,"In the period following the Monetary Policy Report (MPR) of April 2018, several risks it had flagged have been materialising on an ongoing basis. The global macroeconomic and financial environment has been roiled by bouts of financial market volatility, retaliatory trade protectionism among major economies of the world, elevated and volatile crude oil prices, and recurring jitters around the efficacy of managing monetary policy normalisation in the US amidst a late-in-the-cycle US fiscal stimulus, occurring all at once, lashing emerging market economies (EMEs) as an asset class with asset price shocks and capital outflows. More recently, vulnerabilities surfacing amongst specific EMEs have produced powerful contagion effects. Taken together, these global factors appear to be increasing risks around India¡¯s growth prospects over the next 12-month horizon with a slant to the downside. Global growth itself is getting differentiated across economies and the cyclical upswing in global trade that had started in Q4:2017 is being stifled by rising trade tensions.Meanwhile, domestic economic activity has continued to exhibit resilience and stability in these highly unsettled global conditions. On the agricultural front, the spatial distribution of south-west monsoon was somewhat skewed, although most of the kharif crop growing states received normal rainfall. Industrial activity has gathered pace and the outlook for the services sector is gradually improving. Inward foreign direct investment remains buoyant. The slow firming up of private consumption and investment are expected to be sustained in H2:2018-19. The soft headline inflation readings for July and August 2018 relative to projections imply a largely benign food prices outlook in the near term; however, volatility in global financial markets and surging oil prices remain upside risks to inflation over the 12-month ahead horizon. These developments pose challenges for the setting of monetary policy in India.During April-August 2018, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met thrice in accordance with its bi-monthly schedule. Maintaining status quo in its April 2018 meeting, the MPC increased the policy repo rate by 25 basis points (bps) successively in its June and August 2018 meetings. In its June 2018 meeting, the MPC¡¯s vote was unanimous against the backdrop of rising inflation, upward revision in inflation projections, sharper than anticipated increase in crude oil prices, and hardening of households¡¯ inflation expectations.In August, however, the MPC¡¯s vote was by a majority of 5:1. The decision by majority was influenced by further hardening of inflation and inflation expectations amidst uncertainty around the impact of the minimum support price (MSP) hikes. The MPC¡¯s voting pattern, which reflects differences in individual members¡¯ assessments and expectations as well as relative weights on policy goals, is also observed in other central banks (Table I.1)."

Minor flooding was already happening Monday at several points on the Missouri River. Damage was minimal, though several roads and streets were under water.  The Mississippi River was nearing technical flood stage from St. Louis south through Cape Girardeau, with crests expected early this week. Right now, only minor flooding is forecast.  The rising rivers followed heavy weekend rains — some areas got up to 10 inches of rain. One person died and two others were rescued Saturday when their vehicle became stuck in floodwaters in Clinton County.  Forecasts call for occasional storms through at least Thursday in much of the state."
earthquake,"At 12.51 p.m. on Tuesday 22 February 2011, a magnitude 6.3 earthquake caused severe damage in Christchurch and Lyttelton, killing 185 people and injuring several thousand.
The earthquake’s epicentre was near Lyttelton, just 10 km south-east of Christchurch’s central business district. It occurred nearly six months after the 4 September 2010 earthquake.
The earthquake struck at lunchtime, when many people were on the city streets. More than 130 people lost their lives in the collapse of the Canterbury Television and Pyne Gould Corporation buildings. Falling bricks and masonry killed another 11 people, while eight died in two city buses that were crushed by crumbling walls. Rock cliffs collapsed in the Sumner and Redcliffs area, and boulders tumbled down the Port Hills, with five people killed by falling rocks.
Although not as powerful as the magnitude 7.1 earthquake on 4 September 2010, this earthquake occurred on a shallow fault line close to the city, so the shaking was particularly destructive.
The earthquake brought down many buildings damaged the previous September, especially older brick and mortar buildings. Heritage buildings that suffered heavy damage included the Provincial Council Chambers, Lyttelton’s Timeball Station, the Anglican Christchurch Cathedral and the Catholic Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament. Two-thirds of the buildings in the central business district were subsequently demolished, including the city’s tallest building, the Hotel Grand Chancellor.
Liquefaction was much more extensive than in September 2010. Shaking turned water-saturated layers of sand and silt beneath the surface into sludge that squirted upwards through cracks. Thick layers of silt covered properties and streets, and water and sewage from broken pipes flooded streets. House foundations cracked and buckled, wrecking many homes. Irreparable damage necessitated the demolition of several thousand homes, and large tracts of suburban land were subsequently abandoned, with 8,000 properties bought by the government and razed."
wildfires,"The Alaska Interagency Coordination Center was tracking 290 fires in Alaska on July 25, with ""very large"" fires spread across southern Alaska, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The 2015 Alaska fire season is already the third-largest season since reliable records began in 1950, and more than 4.75 million acres have burned. That amount of acreage is more than double the size of Yellowstone National Park and larger than the state of New Jersey, which consists of only 4.492 million acres.
According to USGS, there is not a direct relationship between climate change and fire, ""but researchers have found strong correlations between warm June temperatures and large fire years. Hot, dry spring conditions, however, do not automatically mean fire—something needs to create the spark and actually start the fire. Lightning starts about 35 percent of the fires in Alaska but account for 90 percent of the total area burned.""
Wildfires can alter wildlife habitat, such as by destroying slow-growing lichens in black spruce forests, an important winter food source for caribou.
The fires being tracked are shown on this UAFSMOKE page. It is an initiative supported by the Arctic Region Supercomputing Center and the Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska Fairbanks, in cooperation with colleagues from NOAA's Global System Division, Brazil's Center for Weather Forecasting and Climate Studies (CPTEC/INPE), and the USFS Missoula Fire Sciences Lab."
other,"The Supreme Court on Thursday blocked the Biden administration's Covid-related eviction moratorium.
""Congress was on notice that a further extension would almost surely require new legislation, yet it failed to act in the several weeks leading up to the moratorium's expiration,"" the court wrote in an unsigned, eight-page opinion.
""If a federally imposed eviction moratorium is to continue, Congress must specifically authorize it,"" the court said.
The three liberal justices dissented publicly, citing the spike in Covid-19 cases and the Delta variant.
This latest round of litigation was prompted by the version of the moratorium rolled out by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on August 3, days after the last iteration of the moratorium had expired.
Landlord groups challenging the eviction ban pointed to a concurrence written by Justice Brett Kavanaugh when the earlier version of the moratorium was before the Supreme Court in June. Kavanaugh joined four other justices in letting the moratorium survive then, but he said he was only doing so because it was scheduled to expire on July 31 and said Congress had to act in order to extend it.
The landlords accused the Biden administration of ""gamesmanship"" for ultimately reviving the moratorium after several top administration officials said, in the wake of Kavanaugh's concurrence, that they did not think the Supreme Court would uphold an extension of the moratorium."

MAS assessed this policy stance to be supportive of economic growth, while ensuring low and stable inflation over the medium term. Since the Monetary Policy Statement (MPS) in October 2004, the S$NEER has fluctuated within the upper half of the policy band.  The strong upward pressures on the S$ reflected broad-based US$ weakness amidst renewed concerns over the current account deficit in the US.  In addition, the S$NEER was supported by strong capital inflows into the region, underpinned by general optimism over the regional economic outlook.  MAS intervened significantly in Q4 2004 and into early 2005 to moderate excessive upward pressure on the S$.  Since mid-March, the S$NEER has trended downwards, as the US$ rebounded following the interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve amidst signs in the US of rising inflationary pressures and continuing firmness in the economic data.  The S$NEER has now eased back towards the centre of the policy band.While domestic monetary conditions have tightened over the past six months, overall liquidity conditions remain loose.  Domestic interbank rates have risen in tandem with the increase in the US federal funds rate, with the three-month domestic interbank rate rising from 0.75% at end-May 2004 to 1.44% by end-Sep 2004.  It rose further to 2.13% as at end-March 2005.  Retail interest rates have remained broadly unchanged, although there have been some modest increases in mortgage rates."
other,"The Committee remains committed to bringing headline inflation closer to 4.0 per cent on a durable basis and in a calibrated manner. This requires further significant decline in inflation expectations, especially since the services component of inflation that is sensitive to wage movements has been sticky. The committee decided to change the stance from accommodative to neutral while keeping the policy rate on hold to assess how the transitory effects of demonetisation on inflation and the output gap play out.The Reserve Bank has conducted market liquidity operations consistent with the liquidity management framework put in place in April 2016, progressively moving the system level ex ante liquidity conditions to close to neutrality. This stance will continue. Surplus liquidity should decline with progressive remonetisation. Nonetheless, the currently abundant liquidity with banks is likely to persist into the early months of 2017-18. The Reserve Bank is committed to ensuring efficient and appropriate liquidity management with all the instruments at its command to ensure close alignment of the WACR with the policy rate, improved transmission of policy impulses to lending rates, and adequate flow of credit to productive sectors of the economy.The Committee believes that the environment for timely transmission of policy rates to banks lending rates will be considerably improved if (i) the banking sector¡¯s non-performing assets (NPAs) are resolved more quickly and efficiently; (ii) recapitalisation of the banking sector is hastened; and, (iii) the formula for adjustments in the interest rates on small savings schemes to changes in yields on government securities of corresponding maturity is fully implemented."
drought,"A severe drought in the Czech Republic, which has reached historic levels in its fifth year, is worrying growers as it increasingly hits agriculture.
Scientists say the current series of drought, which began in 2015, is the worst in 500 years.
The temperature spikes have hit hardest in the eastern regions of Moravia and Silesia and the dry spell has forced many farmers to adapt fast. Some have had to cut fruit and wine grape production by 40 per cent.
In Central Bohemia — also hit hard — one grower, Lubo? Hrabánek of Farma Zadní Kopanina, says he has restructured his land to deal with the conditions.
He’s using smaller tracts for growing than the traditional multi-hectare square sectors that date from the communist days.
Hrabánek runs a family farm in the Bohemian Karst area whose main activity is animal production and breeding cattle, pigs and chickens. His four 10-hectare tracts also produce alfalfa, cereals and sometimes corn feed for his animals.
Despite recent rains, which have helped somewhat, Hrabánek has been “strongly impacted by the drought”, he said.
“Long-term care and care of the soil is important. Maybe that's why we focus anxiously on the principle of regular crop rotation.”
Besides using ancestral methods, he said “we try to grow crops that are not very demanding on water. We have not yet had to resort to artificial irrigation”.
The farm’s strategy has allowed it to avoid produce price hikes so far. “Our goal is not to spew production at all costs,” says Hrabánek, adding that his operation tries to tailor production to local needs.
Another farmer in the region — who produces artisanal honey, beets and greens that he markets directly in Prague — says water scarcity has forced him to irrigate year-round.
“We’re one of the only farms in our area still growing vegetables,” he said, noting that pumping from wells gets harder every year. Tensions are growing with neighbouring farms as the water table falls, he added.
Makers of craft beer in the Czech Republic _ a product increasingly in demand at home and abroad _ say they’ve been watching the prices and availability of hops, the country’s most famous export.
A representative of Chroust craft beer says the company buys Bohemian hops for its prime lagers and has not yet seen prices rising but acknowledges “growers are being hit. It could happen at any time”.
Winter wheat is at risk, say many farmers, but corn, with deeper roots, has fared batter. Meanwhile, other crops are likely to be ploughed under, unless more rain arrives soon.
The drought has also harmed grass and alfalfa production, needed for cattle feed, notes Robert Ku?era of the Agrarian Chamber of Ostrava.
An agency set up to study the drought and provide data, Intersucho.cz, reports that the Moravian-Silesian Region is in “one of the worst situations” with extreme drought at levels not seen for the last 50 years.
Authorities are supplying some towns with water tanks this year as they did in 2019, as other add-on effects include the spread of bark beetles and Moravian winemakers planning for a future shift from white wine production to red grapes, which are less dependent on water.
As for the effects on consumers, it’s clear that grocery prices are up but less certain is what role the drought has played, said Patrik Rozumbersky of market analyst company UniCredit. Rising food prices have more likely been driven by effects of the coronavirus, which held up shipments of produce at the country’s borders. A shortage of agriculture workers, who were blocked from travelling to the country from the east, is also a likely culprit, according to Rozumbersky.
Grocery chains Billa and Albert declined to comment on price changes but Prague consumers did appear to bulk up on packaged goods, which may also have had an effect _ though the Czech Republic did not see binge buying at the level witnessed in the UK and US during the COVID-19 lockdowns.
Consumer food price rises were also in line with current inflation reports showing a rate of 7.8 per cent, a rise from last year’s 6.4 per cent rate, according to Rozumbersky.
Czech crop prices, he adds, depend not just on local production levels but on “the quality of harvest in the whole European continent as the price of individual products is formed on the international market”.
At the same time, said Rozumbersky, “I think that the possible effect of drought might become more intensive later in the year as soon as the impact on the harvest is clearer.”
Industry organisations have been cautioning farmers too: the Czech Agricultural Chamber calls groundwater levels “strongly below normal overall,” noting that 71 per cent of wells are at unusually low water depths.
In addition, low water levels have hit key watersheds in the upper Oh?e, Lu?ická Nisa and Smědá river basins, which the chamber calls “strongly below normal.” Also drying up are natural springs, of which 79 per cent are suffering from “with severe or extreme drought”."
earthquake,"Major magnitude 8.1 earthquake - Kermadec Islands, New Zealand, on Thursday, 4 March 2021 at 19:28 (GMT) - information Source changed to USGS As most agencies put the quake magnitude close to 8, while only Geonet only lists it as a much lower magnitude 7.1 event, we decided to trust USGS as primary data source with a magnitude of 8.1. Update Fri, 5 Mar 2021, 02:05 Tsunami warning raised again after third powerful earthquake hit off the coast of North Island, NZ A third powerful earthquake hit off the coast of North Island, New Zealand on Friday, 5 March 2021, 7:28 am local time. This magnitude 8.1 quake occurred near the Kermadec Islands about 880 km north of New Zealand, at a depth of 20-24 km. Although this quake was not felt much in the nearby North Island, the New Zealand National Emergency Management Agency urged people in some areas to head for higher ground. A tsunami warning was raised over several coastal areas of both North and South Island, New Zealand. The warning was lifted later that day, at around 1:40 pm local time. According to the latest tsunami threat message from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, tsunami waves were measured as far as the French Polynesia more than 3000 km northeast of the earthquake's epicenter. The northern coast of New Zealand's North Island was hit by tsunami waves of about 0.16 meters high, i.e., only 16 centimeters. The areas hit include the coasts from North Cape to East Cape. No significant damage has been reported. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS ), the earthquake resulted from a reverse faulting in the Tonga-Kermadec subduction zone at a depth of about 22 km. USGS was also able to identify the earlier 7.4 quake as a foreshock preceding this quake by nearly 2 hours. The first of the three major earthquakes, which occurred 6 hours prior the second quake, did not directly cause the second and third quakes."
wildfires,"Catastrophic and unprecedented bushfires in Australia have killed more than 28 people, destroyed hundreds of homes and burned hundreds of thousands of hectares of land, causing massive devastation to wildlife, ecosystems and the environment. The fires come after Australia's hottest, driest year on record. They have led to hazardous air quality in major cities throughout Australia, impacted New Zealand and sent smoke drifting thousands of kilometres across the Pacific to South America.
The fires have led to hazardous air quality in major cities throughout Australia, impacted New Zealand and sent smoke drifting thousands of kilometres across the Pacific to South America. 
The long range transport of smoke reached both Argentina and Chile on 6 January, according to the national meteorological and hydrological services.
Wildfires release harmful pollutants including particulate matter and toxic gases such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and non-methane organic compounds into the atmosphere. The fires have already released approximately 400 megatonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, according to the European Union's Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service (CAMS). On 2 January CAMS saw that the highest concentrations of atmospheric carbon monoxide in the world were over the ‘clean’ South Pacific Ocean, having come from fires in New South Wales. Taking Australia as a whole, carbon dioxide emission hasn’t been particularly high this wildfire season, but emissions from New South Wales are many times higher than the 2003_2018 average."
other,"Currently available information suggests that the recovery of the global economy has strengthened, supported by the economic stimulus in major countries, accelerated vaccinations, and the relaxation of restrictions on economic activity. In global financial markets, the rise in stock prices in major countries has moderated as risk-taking tendencies were offset by factors such as inflation concerns. Government bond yields have fluctuated within a relatively narrow range. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the severity of the resurgence of COVID-19 and the status of vaccine distribution, as well as by national policy responses and their effects.The recovery of the Korean economy has strengthened. Exports have sustained their buoyancy and facilities investment has continued to recover robustly, while private consumption has gradually emerged from its slump. Labor market conditions have continued to improve, with the year-on-year increase in the number of persons employed having risen. Going forward, the recovery of the Korean economy is likely to strengthen thanks to the buoyancy of exports and investment as well as the improvement in private consumption. GDP growth this year is projected to be around 4%, significantly above the February forecast of 3.0%.Consumer price inflation has risen markedly to the lower-2% level due to the rising prices of petroleum products and agricultural, livestock, and fisheries products as well as the accelerating increase in service prices. Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) has moved up considerably to the lower-1% level. The inflation expectations of the general public have risen slightly within the lower-2% range. It is forecast that consumer price inflation will run at the upper-1% range this year, considerably exceeding the February forecast of 1.3%. Core inflation is forecast to run at the lower-1% range.In domestic financial markets, long-term market interest rates have risen, affected mainly by strengthened economic recoveries at home and abroad. Stock prices continued to increase before declining moderately due to global financial market movements. The Korean won to US dollar exchange rate has fluctuated slightly. Household loan growth has remained high, and housing prices have continued to increase rapidly in all parts of the country.The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to support the economy and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. While the Korean economic recovery is expected to strengthen and inflation to remain at a high level for some time, there are underlying uncertainties surrounding the path of COVID-19 and inflationary pressures on the demand side are forecast to be modest. Thus, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance. In this process the Board will assess developments related to COVID-19 and economic developments in major countries, while paying closer attention to the buildup of financial imbalances such as fund flows concentrated in asset markets and household debt growth."
earthquake,"A magnitude-6.8 offshore earthquake occurred in the South Pacific Ocean off central Chile at around 1839 Dec. 27. The epicenter was about 142 km (88 miles) northwest of Valdivia. The tremor occurred at a depth of about 10 km (6 miles), and moder-to-strong shaking was probably felt throughout central Chile. The quake likely damaged structures in nearby areas. Aftershocks are possible over the coming days.
Officials may temporarily shut down transportation infrastructure in the tremor zone to check for damage. Disruptions could occur during shutdowns. Utility outages are possible, particularly near the earthquake's epicenter. The event has not prompted any tsunami advisories."
other,"During 2017-18, the combined fiscal position of the centre and states deteriorated vis-¨¤-vis BE due to elevated revenue expenditure and subdued growth in revenue collection resulting from the teething problems with the GST implementation. Consequently, the fiscal deficit of centre and states deviated significantly from BE. The combined gross fiscal deficit (GFD) is budgeted to decline to 5.9 per cent of GDP in 2018-19 from 6.6 per cent in the revised estimates (RE) for 2017-18. Outstanding liabilities of the general government (centre and states) are budgeted to decline to 68.3 per cent of GDP by end-March 2019 from 68.9 per cent a year ago (RE).6 Concerted efforts towards consolidation will, however, be needed for achieving the revised Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) targets, i.e., the central government debt to GDP ratio of 40 per cent and the general government debt to GDP ratio of 60 per cent by 2024-25.The Reserve Bank managed the centre¡¯s market borrowing programme during 2018-19 so far as per the planned issuance schedule, despite reduced demand for government securities from foreign portfolio investors (FPIs). Against the budgeted market borrowing for 2018-19 at _6,055 billion (about 3 per cent higher than last year), the central government completed 47.6 per cent of its budgeted gross borrowings by end-September 2018 (64.1 per cent in the corresponding period of 2017-18). It decided not to front-load market borrowings in the first half of the year in a departure from the typical pattern of market borrowings (Table III.4). It has decided to reduce its budgeted market borrowings in the second half of the year by _705 billion, which will take the market borrowings for the full year to _5,350 billion against the budgeted _6,055 billion. The government expects that higher inflows in the National Small Savings Fund (NSSF) scheme and adjustments in buyback programme would enable it to meet the budgeted fiscal deficit target even with lower market borrowings. The states completed 27.6 per cent of their budgeted gross borrowings by end-September 2018 as against 36.7 per cent in the corresponding period of 2017-18. The bulk of market borrowings by the states would be in the second half of 2018-19."

other,"The recipe worked brilliantly. Sustained price stability and steady economic growth were the order of the day. The result was the Great Moderation. Indeed, monetary policy was getting boring. During this period, monetary policy was unencumbered by financial stability considerations. To be fair, central bankers were not unconcerned about financial stability. But it was seen as the preserve of prudential regulation and supervision. Academic thinking reinforced policy practice: the macroeconomic models central banks relied on did not map clear linkages between financial and real variables.Another constraint may have been the perceived difficulty in identifying a financial bubble ex ante. How does one tell if the value of an asset reflected economic fundamentals or speculative fever? So when faced with potential financial vulnerabilities, it was deemed better to clean up after a bubble had actually burst than to try to lean against suspected bubbles.But beneath the still waters of macroeconomic stability, deadly financial whirlpools were forming. Financial imbalances built up steadily in the advanced economies from the mid-1990s to the mid-¡¯00s and culminated in the global financial crisis. The crisis sent financial systems spinning and plunged economies into recession. The cost of cleaning up proved extremely high. All this reignited debate about how to proceed, and monetary policy became interesting again."
wildfires,"Thousands of firefighters are working to put out wildfires in Alaska as they blaze across the state. The Alaska Division of Forestry reported that as of today there are 317 wildfires burning in the Last Frontier. On Wednesday alone, there were 40 new fires and Thursday saw an additional 28 new fires, bringing the total acreage burned to 624,496 acres.
Alaska is no stranger to wildfires, but climate change has drastically increased the frequency of wildfires. On Wednesday, Todd Sanford, a climate scientist at Climate Central, released a report on how Alaska is entering a new era for wildfires."

drought,"Over the past two years, drought has severely affected much of Brazil. According to a bulletin from the National Center for Monitoring and Alerts on Natural Disasters (Cemaden), an agency of the Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovations and Communications, rainfall has been below historical averages in the center-west, south and part of the southeast regions of the country, including in the state of S?o Paulo.
The phenomenon became more evident in 2012. “Severe drought started in the northeast and lasted almost seven years,” says Cemaden researcher Adriana Cuartas. “Then, in 2014, water supply was in critical conditions in the Greater S?o Paulo area. Now the focus of concerns turns to the south, where rainfall has been below average for almost two years.”
Scientist Ant?nio Donato Nobre, author of the report “The Future Climate of Amazonia,” is emphatic: “South America is drying up as a result of the combined effects of deforestation and climate change.”
Low precipitation has an immediate impact on agriculture. The next affected are water supply and power generation. Water levels in the reservoirs of several dams have been low, including Itaipu, the world’s second-largest hydroelectric power plant. “The water that comes from the rivers to the reservoir is below the minimum level recorded in 1993. It’s a critical situation,” Cuartas says. “The Itaipu basin is used not only for power generation, but also for water supply.”
Recent rains in the south may bring temporary relief to agriculture, but water conditions take time to return to normal. “Rainfall would have to be at average levels or above for several months for the water system to start recovering and resume expected levels,” Cuartas says.
Agribusiness has been suffering losses as a result of drought, but it also contributes to the changes in the water regime. Deforesting the Amazon to establish cattle ranches, plantations and logging reduces precipitation in Brazil and other Latin American countries. With deforestation increasing, agribusiness and power generation may collapse in Brazil.
The Amazon Forest works as a cooling system. On a single day, a robust tree with its 20-meter (66-foot) canopy pumps around 1,100 liters (290 gallons) of water into the atmosphere. These masses of air carrying vapor from the forest’s transpiration are called “flying rivers.” They take humidity from the Amazon Basin to Brazil’s center-west, southeast and south regions as well as to neighboring countries. With fewer trees in the forest, there is less humidity in the air. And that leads to drought."
other,"Industrial growth, measured by the index of industrial production (IIP), accelerated in June-July 2018 on a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis, underpinned mainly by high growth in consumer durables, notably two-wheelers, readymade garments, stainless steel utensils, auto components and spares, and accessories. Growth in consumer non-durables also accelerated in July. The infrastructure and construction sector continued to show solid growth. Primary goods growth accelerated, driven by mining, electricity and petroleum refinery products. Growth in capital goods production spiked in June, but decelerated sharply in July. The output of eight core industries growth remained strong in July, driven by coal, petroleum refinery products, steel and cement, but moderated in August. Capacity utilisation (CU) declined from 75.2 per cent in Q4:2017-18 to 73.8 per cent in Q1:2018-19, while seasonally adjusted CU increased by 1.8 percentage points to the long-term average of 74.9 per cent. Based on the Reserve Bank¡¯s business expectations index (BEI), the assessment for Q2:2018-19 improved, led by enhanced production, order books, exports and capacity utilisation. The August and September manufacturing purchasing managers¡¯ index (PMI) remained in expansion zone; the September print rebounded close to the July level confirming robustness of manufacturing activity.High-frequency indicators of services in July and August present a mixed picture. Indicators of rural demand, viz., growth in tractor and two-wheeler sales, slowed down. Passenger vehicle sales, an indicator of urban demand, declined possibly due to rising fuel prices. However, growth in air passenger traffic _ another indicator of urban demand _ remained robust. Transportation sector indicators, viz., commercial vehicle sales and port cargo, expanded at an accelerated pace. Steel consumption and cement production, indicators of construction activity, showed strong growth. The services PMI remained in expansion zone in August and September, though it decelerated from July, with slower expansion in new business and employment."
other,"At present, the Central Bank conducts monetary policy in line with a flexible inflation targeting (FIT) framework, aimed at stabilising inflation at mid single digit levels over the medium term while supporting economic growth to reach its potential. In terms of operational aspects of this framework, the Central Bank uses its policy instruments to guide short term interest rates, particularly the average weighted call money rate (AWCMR) as the operating target.Prior to this transition, the Central Bank conducted monetary policy within an enhanced monetary policy framework with features of both monetary targeting and flexible inflation targeting (FIT). Under this enhanced monetary policy framework, the Central Bank attempted to stabilise inflation in mid-single digits over the medium term, while supporting the growth momentum of the economy and flexibility in exchange rate management. Similar to the current practice, the AWCMR was used as the operating target."

earthquake,"M7.7 quake strikes S. Pacific, no Pacific-wide tsunami threat A magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck in the vicinity of New Caledonia on Thursday, triggering a tsunami warning for countries and territories in the South Pacific but no destructive Pacific-wide tsunami is expected. The powerful quake, which struck at 12:20 a.m. local time at a location southeast of the Loyalty Islands, had a relatively shallow depth of 10 kilometers, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The Hawaii-based Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said that ""based on all available data a destructive Pacific-wide tsunami is not expected."" But it warned that ""hazardous tsunami waves from this earthquake are possible"" along the coasts of such places as New Caledonia, Vanuatu, Fiji, New Zealand, Tonga and the Solomon Islands. Japan's Pacific coastal areas from Hokkaido to Okinawa may observe slight sea-level changes, possibly beginning around 6 a.m., due to the impact of the quake, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. Although the effect could continue for around 24 hours, it is unlikely to cause any damage, the agency added."
other,"Another aspect of the Federal Reserve's policies that has been discussed is their implications for the federal budget. The Federal Reserve earns substantial interest on the assets it holds in its portfolio, and, other than the amount needed to fund our cost of operations, all net income is remitted to the Treasury. With the expansion of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, yearly remittances have roughly tripled in recent years, with payments to the Treasury totaling approximately $290 billion between 2009 and 2012.6 However, if the economy continues to strengthen, as we anticipate, and policy accommodation is accordingly reduced, these remittances would likely decline in coming years. Federal Reserve analysis shows that remittances to the Treasury could be quite low for a time in some scenarios, particularly if interest rates were to rise quickly.7 However, even in such scenarios, it is highly likely that average annual remittances over the period affected by the Federal Reserve's purchases will remain higher than the pre-crisis norm, perhaps substantially so. Moreover, to the extent that monetary policy promotes growth and job creation, the resulting reduction in the federal deficit would dwarf any variation in the Federal Reserve's remittances to the Treasury."
other,"Monetary policy increases liquidity to create economic growth. It reduces liquidity to prevent inflation. Central banks use interest rates, bank reserve requirements, and the number of government bonds that banks must hold. All these tools affect how much banks can lend. The volume of loans affects the money supply.The money supply includes forms of credit, cash, checks, and money market mutual funds. The most important of these forms of money is credit. Credit includes loans, bonds, and mortgages. In a recession, central banks might combat high unemployment by giving banks more money. Banks in turn lower interest rates, which allows businesses to hire more employees. This is an example of expansionary monetary policy."
other,"Congress has delegated responsibility for monetary policy to the Federal Reserve (the Fed), the nation¡¯s central bank, but retains oversight responsibilities for ensuring that the Fed is adhering to its statutory mandate of ¡°maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.¡± To meet its price stability mandate, the Fed has set a longer-run goal of 2% inflation.The Fed¡¯s control over monetary policy stems from its exclusive ability to alter the money supply and credit conditions more broadly. Normally, the Fed conducts monetary policy by setting a target for the federal funds rate, the rate at which banks borrow and lend reserves on an overnight basis. It meets its target through open market operations, financial transactions traditionally involving U.S. Treasury securities. Beginning in 2007, the federal funds target was reduced from 5.25% to a range of 0% to 0.25% in December 2008, which economists call the zero lower bound. By historical standards, rates were kept unusually low for an unusually long time to mitigate the effects of the 2007-2009 financial crisis and its aftermath. Starting in December 2015, the Fed began raising interest rates. In total, the Fed raised rates nine times between 2015 and 2018, by 0.25 percentage points each time. In light of increased economic uncertainty, the Fed then reduced interest rates by 0.25 percentage points in a series of steps beginning in July 2019.The Fed influences interest rates to affect interest-sensitive spending, such as business capital spending on plant and equipment, household spending on consumer durables, and residential investment. In addition, when interest rates diverge between countries, it causes capital flows that affect the exchange rate between foreign currencies and the dollar, which in turn affects spending on exports and imports. Through these channels, monetary policy can be used to stimulate or slow aggregate spending in the short run. In the long run, monetary policy mainly affects inflation. A low and stable rate of inflation promotes price transparency and, thereby, sounder economic decisions.The Fed¡¯s relative independence from Congress and the Administration has been justified by many economists on the grounds that it reduces political pressure to make monetary policy decisions that are inconsistent with a long-term focus on stable inflation. But independence reduces accountability to Congress and the Administration, and recent criticism of the Fed by the President has raised the question about the proper balance between the two.While the federal funds target was at the zero lower bound, the Fed attempted to provide additional stimulus through unsterilized purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities (MBS), a practice popularly referred to as quantitative easing (QE). Between 2009 and 2014, the Fed undertook three rounds of QE. The third round was completed in October 2014, at which point the Fed¡¯s balance sheet was $4.5 trillion¡ªfive times its precrisis size. After QE ended, the Fed maintained the balance sheet at the same level until September 2017, when it began to very gradually reduce it to a more normal size. The Fed has raised interest rates in the presence of a large balance sheet through the use of two new tools¡ªby paying banks interest on reserves held at the Fed and by engaging in reverse repurchase agreements (reverse repos) through a new overnight facility. In January 2019, the Fed announced that it would continue using these tools to set interest rates permanently. In August 2019, it stopped reducing the balance sheet from its current size of $3.8 trillion. However, the remaining MBS on its balance sheet would gradually be replaced with Treasury securities as they mature. In response to turmoil in the repo market in September 2019, the Fed began intervening in the repo market and began expanding its balance sheet again in October 2019."

earthquake,"Magnitude 6.9 earthquake strikes near Ishinomaki, Ishinomaki Shi, Miyagi, Japan Just 11 minutes ago, a 6.9-magnitude earthquake struck near Ishinomaki, Ishinomaki Shi, Miyagi, Japan. The tremor was recorded early evening on Saturday 20 March 2021 at 6:09 pm local time, at an intermediate depth of 73 km below the surface. The event was filed by the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ), the first seismological agency to report it. A second report was later issued by the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC), which listed it as a magnitude 6.9 earthquake as well. Based on the preliminary seismic data, the quake should have been widely felt by almost everyone in the area of the epicenter. It might have caused light to moderate damage. Moderate shaking probably occurred in Ishinomaki (pop. 117,200) located 50 km from the epicenter, Yamoto (pop. 32,000) 57 km away, _funato (pop. 35,400) 68 km away, Shiogama (pop. 59,500) 75 km away, Furukawa (pop. 76,300) 80 km away, Ichinoseki (pop. 63,000) 81 km away, Sendai (pop. 1,063,100) 90 km away, and Mizusawa (pop. 61,300) 98 km away.

In the spring and early summer, a number of key indicators of economic activity softened relative to the readings posted in late 2009 and the first part of 2010, raising concerns about the durability of the recovery. In light of these developments--and in order to put the economic recovery on a firmer footing--the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) provided additional monetary policy stimulus during the second half of 2010 by reinvesting principal repayments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in longer-term Treasury securities and by announcing its intention to purchase an additional $600 billion of Treasury securities by the end of the second quarter of 2011."

earthquake,"An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 struck off southern Alaska's coast late Tuesday, shaking the Alaska Peninsula and briefly sparking tsunami concerns before officials said no destructive waves were coming.
The earthquake was centered in the Pacific Ocean about 60 miles southeast of Perryville on the sparsely populated Alaska Peninsula, striking around 10:12 p.m. local time (2:12 a.m. Wednesday ET).
The Alaska Peninsula protrudes from mainland Alaska and is flanked to the southwest by the Aleutian Islands.
Reports of significant damage, if any, weren't immediately available. A tsunami warning initially was issued for south Alaska and the Alaska Peninsula, but was canceled by early Wednesday, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The warning sent people to higher ground in cities like Sand Point, an island community of about 1,000 people off the peninsula, the Anchorage Daily News reported.
People in Sand Point gathered at a high school until shortly after midnight, when officials gave an all-clear, Jordan Keeler, an Anchorage-based city administrator, told the newspaper.
""The first wave didn't materialize, which is a great thing,"" Keeler, who was in contact with staff in Sand Point, told the Anchorage Daily News. No reports of major structural damage were made on the island, Keeler told the newspaper.
""We've canceled the (tsunami) advisories because it doesn't look like it's becoming a large wave or any larger,"" National Tsunami Warning Center Director James Gridley said, according to CNN affiliate KTUU.
Strong shaking was reported on the peninsula, the USGS said. Light to weak shaking was reported around Kodiak, about 300 miles northeast of the quake's center, and in Anchorage, some 530 miles from the center, according to the USGS.
In Kodiak, a city of about 6,000 people, a long line of cars headed up a mountain after residents learned of the tsunami warning late Tuesday, John Cannon told KTUU.
Police were ""trying to clear the lower areas down by the harbor,"" he said.
""You (could) hear the tsunami alarms. It's rather eerie,"" he told KTUU.
This quake's depth was 28 kilometers, or 17 miles, the USGS said -- relatively shallow.
""Anything below 70 kilometers is considered a shallow quake,"" CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar said. ""That's important, because shallow earthquakes often cause the most damage, compared to the ones that are deeper, regardless of the strength.""
More than 20 aftershocks followed the quake late Tuesday to early Wednesday, ranging from magnitudes of 2.8 to 6.1."
drought,"Widespread drought in California and other parts of the western United States has been widely covered, but earlier this year,  drought conditions in southeast Florida were  “extreme” and are still considered “abnormally dry” according to the National Drought Mitigation Center. This heavily populated area of Florida – which is home to more than eight million people and includes the cities of Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach – is also a major agricultural area.
Even though Florida is in its rainy season, lasting from May until October, the South Florida Water Management District reports that May and June rainfall totals were well below average across most of the region. District weather records show that this May and June period was the driest since 2004 and the ninth driest since recordkeeping began in 1932. Of course, a tropical disturbance or hurricane that contains significant rainfall, like the one experienced last month, can make up at least some of this deficit, but waiting for weather isn’t something to rely on to fix the problem.
How can agricultural producers conserve water? One way is to get a free irrigation evaluation from a Mobile Irrigation Lab to get advice on an irrigation system that can save money and water.
When water is not applied uniformly on land it can be wasted and crops and plants can suffer. Applying too much water can also leach valuable fertilizers and pesticides past the crop root zone, wasting money and possibly harming the water quality."
valcano eruption,"Why Japan’s deadly Ontake eruption could not be predicted Mount Ontake, Japan’s second-highest volcano, erupted killing at least 31 people on September 27. Since then, there has been feverish speculation about why tourists were on an active volcano and why the eruption wasn’t predicted. Mount Ontake (also known as Ontakesan) is a stratovolcano which last erupted in 1979-80 and 2007 (there was also a possible, unconfirmed eruption in 1991). Before this, there were no recorded historical eruptions at Mount Ontake. Since the eruption in 1980, Ontake has been monitored by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). It has seismometers around the volcano to record volcanic tremors and instruments to measure any changes around the volcano. This would provide the JMA with signs that there was magma movement underneath the volcano and that perhaps an eruption was imminent. There had been a slight increase in volcanic tremors starting at the beginning of September. Why, then, was this eruption not predicted?"
other,"Since the MPC met last in December 2019, global economic activity has remained slow-paced, but is getting differentiated across geographies. Among the key advanced economies (AEs), the US economy grew by 2.1 per cent in Q4:2019, the same pace as in Q3, with slack in consumer spending offset by government expenditure. In the euro area, economic activity slowed down in Q4 as France and Italy shrank unexpectedly amid waning consumer confidence. Growth momentum in the UK appears to have weakened in Q4 as reflected in a decline in industrial production and tepid retail sales. The Japanese economy was weighed down in Q4 by weak retail sales as reflected in subdued consumer spending in the wake of the sales tax hike in October. Industrial production in Japan was pulled down by muted global demand.Among emerging market economies (EMEs), the Chinese economy slowed down to a 29-year low of 6.1 per cent in 2019, caused by sluggish domestic demand and prolonged trade tensions. In Russia, available indicators point to a loss of momentum in activity in Q4:2019 with industrial production easing, although private consumption may have provided some cushion. In Brazil, activity seems to have slowed down, as reflected in a contraction in industrial production and depressed retail sales. The South African economy recorded a growth of -0.6 per cent in Q3 and is likely to have also contracted in Q4 as industrial production slumped and household spending remained subdued amidst lingering consumer pessimism.Crude oil and gold prices shot up in early January sparked by the US-Iran confrontation, but both softened from mid-January as geo-political tensions eased. By end-January, crude oil prices dipped sharply due to sell-offs triggered by the outbreak of the coronavirus. Gold prices, on the other hand, inched up towards end-January because of safe haven demand. International food prices have been rising on higher demand and supply disruptions from major exporting countries. Reflecting these developments, inflation has edged up in some major AEs and EMEs.Global financial markets remained resilient in December 2019 and for the most part of January 2020 as thawing US-China trade relations and improved prospects of an orderly Brexit buoyed investors¡¯ sentiment. Equity markets rallied across AEs and EMEs, turning bearish towards end-January with the outbreak of the coronavirus as markets braced up for the likely adverse impact on growth prospects, particularly in China. However, equity markets in most economies recovered some of the losses in early February. Bond yields, which had hardened in the US towards the end of 2019 as investors turned to riskier assets, softened in January 2020, especially after the US Fed left the policy rate unchanged and assured the extension of repo operations. In the euro area, bond yields sank further into negative territory in January. Yields also softened across several EMEs. In currency markets, the US dollar strengthened in January against major advanced economies in sympathy with factors impacting US bond markets. EME currencies, which were generally trading with an appreciating bias, have depreciated since the last week of January."

Officials say the uncontrolled blaze prompted evacuations of more than 500 people and left a blanket of smoke over the city.
U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Julie Thomas says no injuries or damage to structures were reported.
The Clark County Department of Air Quality extended a health advisory for smoke and ground-level ozone through Sunday around Las Vegas.
Some 600 firefighters were battling the blaze with the help of an aerial assault involving five helicopters and five air tankers, but they’re hampered by steep, rugged terrain, temperatures in the upper 90s and wind gusts of up to 40 mph.

drought,"El Nino-induced drought has left Africa dry and hungry. It is now compelling authorities of the Kruger National Park to kill about 350 hippos and buffaloes. Severe drought in southern Africa, dubbed as the worst in 35 years, has pushed the animals in South Africa’s biggest wildlife park to extreme level of suffering.
According to a spokesperson for South African National Parks, the protracted dry spell had caused a shortage of food for the animals. The carrying capacity of the national park has gone far below than what it accommodates: 8,000 hippos and 47,000 buffaloes.
According to one of the spokespersons of the Park, these two species consume large amount of vegetation and most of them are expected to die anyway because of the drought. Water scarcity during drought makes hippos more vulnerable to poaching as they come and gather in ponds.
When millions of people are facing food crisis in neighbouring countries and water restrictions have been imposed back home, the authorities look to take pressure off the land by culling the animals with the objective of preventing animals from suffering."
other,"Liquidity conditions tightened in the second half of December with advance tax outflows. Tightness spilled over into January 2016 on the back of a seasonal pick-up in demand for currency, restrained spending by the government and a pick-up in bank credit growth, in relation to deposit mobilisation. In order to mitigate these conditions, the Reserve Bank injected liquidity through variable rate term repos of varying tenors ranging from overnight to 56 days, besides provision through the regular liquidity windows. The average daily liquidity injection (including variable rate overnight and term repos) increased from _ 1,200 billion in December to about _ 1,345 billion in January. In addition, the Reserve Bank also injected _ 200 billion through open market purchase operations on December 7 and January 20. In response, money market rates remained close to the policy rate with a marginal downside bias. Bank credit in the form of personal loans and non-bank flows from both domestic and foreign sources grew strongly.India¡¯s exports remained in contraction mode for the thirteenth successive month in December, although there are indications of a sequential bottoming out. In volume terms too, the rate of decline appears to be moderating. While softer petroleum, oil and lubricants (POL) and commodity prices helped to contain the trade deficit, these benign effects were offset by a spike in the quantum of gold and POL imports. As a consequence, the trade deficit widened during December in relation to preceding months, though the overall current account deficit is likely to remain well contained and easily financed. Net foreign direct investment (FDI) and non-resident deposits have remained robust in relation to last year. The persisting decline in oil prices may, however, impact the flow of remittances from the Gulf region where fiscal positions are deteriorating rapidly. Portfolio investment also recorded some outflows since November. Nevertheless, as on January 22, 2016, foreign exchange reserves stood at US$ 347.6 billion _ an accretion of US$ 5.9 billion during the current financial year so far."
drought,"Farmers in Northern Ireland are facing the worst drought since 1976. It came after an unusually dry spell and the sunniest spring ever, with records dating back to 1929.
Allan Chambers, a member of the UFU's Seeds and Cereals Committee, said the lack of rainfall placed farmers under a dire situation. According to Met Office, this year's spring, which spans from March to May, was the sunniest on record for the region.
The season recorded an average of 564.4 hours of sunshine across the area's weather stations-- the average for a Northern Irish spring is 428.78. The Met Office also recorded an average of 125.3 mm of rain, which is only 52% of the spring average.
The average spring 2020 temperature for Northern Ireland was at 13.04 °C (55.47 °F), which was 1.25 °C (2.25 °F) higher than normal.
Chambers, a former chairman of the committee, is based outside Downpatrick and has three main crops-- winter barley, winter wheat, and forage maize. Both winter crops are in trouble, he said, while the maize needs rain.
""It’s been horrendous,"" Chambers described, pointing out that the situation feels worse than what the weather bureau indicated. His farm had only experienced as little as 15 to 25% of usual rain during spring.
""It just hasn’t rained for two-and-a-half months. I’m farming now for almost 60 years, and this is the most extreme spring that I have ever seen.”
""The closest we came to the drought situation was back in 1976. This has been even more severe.""
What makes it worse is that his crops were already suffering after the winter, which he said was the wettest four months ever."
wildfires,"Spanish authorities said they have moved more than 500 more residents from the path of the five-day-old forest fire, which has affected over 4,400 hectares on the volcanic island located off the northwest coast of Africa, the Spanish news agency Efe said late Monday. A 54-year-old forestry worker died on Thursday while helping to fight the wildfire.
About 350 firefighters, supported by four planes and eight helicopters dumping water, are battling the fire but strong winds and high temperatures are making work difficult, the authorities said.
The regional government for the island, part of the Canary Islands archipelago, says the evacuation of two neighborhoods in the town of Villa de Mazo took place Sunday morning shortly after midnight as the fire spread through the hilly terrain. This came only hours after authorities said some of the 2,500 residents previously moved to safety could now return to their homes.
A German man admitted to police on Friday that he had started the fire accidentally by burning some of his soiled toilet paper. Spanish media say he has been charged with grave negligence and was denied bail after a judicial hearing Saturday while police continued their investigation.
Local Spanish media reported that the man had been living on the most northwestern island in the Canary Islands for at least four years, most recently in a cave. He is currently being held without bail."
other,"Inflation has evolved closely along the trajectory set by the monetary policy stance. With unfavourable base effects on the ebb and benign prices of fruits and vegetables and crude oil, the January 2016 target of 6 per cent should be met. Going forward, under the assumption of a normal monsoon and the current level of international crude oil prices and exchange rates, inflation is expected to be inertial and be around 5 per cent by the end of fiscal 2016-17 (Chart 1). However, the implementation of the VII Central Pay Commission award, which has not been factored into these projections, will impart upward momentum to this trajectory for a period of one to two years. The Reserve Bank will adjust the forecast path as and when more clarity emerges on the timing of implementation. Vagaries in the spatial and temporal distribution of the monsoon and the impact of adverse geo-political events on commodity prices and financial markets add additional uncertainty to the baseline. Prospects for the rabi harvest are improving slowly. The near-term outlook for industrial activity may be constrained by adverse base effects in Q4 and still weak exports, although the pick-up in corporate profitability on the back of declining input costs may provide an offset. Some categories of services are likely to gain momentum on expectations of higher activity in coming months, though the aggregate state of activity remains muted. On balance, therefore, GVA growth for 2015-16 is kept unchanged at 7.4 per cent with a downside bias.For 2016-17, growth is expected to strengthen gradually, notwithstanding significant headwinds. Expectations of a normal monsoon after two consecutive years of rainfall deficiency, the large positive terms of trade gain, improving real incomes of households and lower input costs of firms should contribute to strengthening the growth momentum. Yet, still weak domestic private investment demand in a phase of balance sheet adjustments, re-emergence of concerns relating to stalled projects, excess capacity in industry, sluggish external demand conditions dampening export growth could act as headwinds. Based on an assessment of the balance of risks, GVA growth for 2016-17 is projected at 7.6 per cent (Chart 2)."
drought,"India is reeling under severe water crisis and rural distress as the country faced two consecutive deficient monsoon seasons in 2014 and 2015. But the worst is yet to come as more frequent drought monsoons are expected to come India’s way between 2020 and 2049, according to a scientific paper to be published in Current Science. The paper was first reported by The Indian Express.
The study refers to past rainfall records to understand why this is likely to happen.
After India began taking rainfall measurements since the 1840s, it was observed that the country has three-decade-long periods or epochs of alternating dry and wet monsoons. For example, during the dry epoch 1960-89, there were 10 monsoon drought years, but during 1930-59, India had only two drought monsoons. And so the cycle has been observed from 1840 to 1989.
Met experts found this alternating nature of dry and wet tri-decadal phases to be associated with the cold phase of the Atlantic multi-decadal oscillation in sea surface temperature. Curiously, the 1990-2019 epoch was expected to be a wet one, going by the cycle of the ocean-atmosphere system of the earlier 150-year period. 2014 and 2015 were part of a three decade period, 1990-2019, which was supposed to have more good monsoons and very few bad monsoons. But while 1990 to 2000 saw no drought monsoons, the following two decades have seen five drought monsoons so far (2002, 2004, 2009, 2014 and 2015).
“...the frequent drought scenario has reappeared after the first decade of the expected wet epoch. The cooling trend of the Asian upper troposphere over Central Asia is believed to have caused this,"" explains the paper authored by researchers from Kochi-based Nansen Environmental Research Centre India and Pune-based Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM)."

other,"Since the last MPC meeting in October 2018, global economic activity has shown increasing signs of weakness on rising trade tensions. Among advanced economies (AEs), economic activity appears to be slowing in the US in Q4:2018, after a buoyant Q3. The Euro area growth lost pace in Q3, impacted by weaker trade growth and new vehicle emission standards. The Japanese economy contracted in Q3 on subdued external and domestic demand.Economic activity also decelerated in major emerging market economies (EMEs) in Q3. In China, growth slowed down on weak domestic demand. The ongoing trade tensions and the possible cooling of the housing market pose major risks to growth in China. The Russian economy lost some traction, pulled down largely by a weak agriculture harvest, though the growth was buttressed by strong performance of the energy sector. The Brazilian economy seems to be recovering gradually from the economic disruption in the first half of the year. The South African economy expanded in Q3, after contracting in the previous two quarters, driven by agriculture and manufacturing.Crude oil prices have declined sharply, reflecting higher supplies and easing of geo-political tensions. Base metal prices have continued to decline on selling pressure following weak demand from major economies. Gold price has risen underpinned by safe haven demand triggered by political uncertainty in some geographies, though a strong dollar may stem the rise. The inflation scenario has remained broadly unchanged in the US and the Euro area. In many key EMEs, however, inflation has risen, though the recent retreat in energy prices, tightening of policy stances by central banks and stabilising of currencies may have a salutary impact, going forward."
other,"In April this year, MAS reaffirmed the policy of a modest and gradual appreciation of the S$NEER policy band which has been in place since April 2004.

It is a powerful tool to regulate macroeconomic variables such as inflation and unemployment.These policies are implemented through different tools, including the adjustment of the interest rates, purchase or sale of government securities, and changing the amount of cash circulating in the economy. The central bank or a similar regulatory organization is responsible for formulating these policies."
other,"In July last year, the MAS announced that it was prepared to allow a gradual and modest appreciation of the Singapore dollar on a trade weighted basis. The trade-weighted S$ has generally been appreciating over the past year and is now within the upper-half of the policy band. The policy has been appropriate in creating conditions conducive for growth while keeping inflationary pressures in check. In 2001, Singapore's GDP growth is expected to moderate to a more sustainable rate of 5-7% in 2001, following the rapid expansion last year and in line with weakening external demand.Domestic inflationary pressures have been rising over the past year, reflecting a tightening of the labour market and the recovery in domestic demand. This will be partially offset by lower imported inflation, if oil prices decline as expected. On balance, we expect CPI inflation to be higher this year than in 2000, but to remain below 2% for the year as a whole."
Typhoon,"The death toll from Typhoon Bopha climbed to more than 100 people on Wednesday, while scores of others remain missing in the worst-hit areas of the southern Philippines.
At least 43 people died when torrents of water rampaged down a mountain in New Bataan town in Compostela Valley province and engulfed a school and village hall where people were taking shelter from the storm. Nine soldiers and an unspecified number of villages were missing, army Maj. Gen. Ariel Bernardo told The Associated Press.
Six villagers drowned in floods in Montevista town, Compostela Valley provincial spokeswoman Fe Maestre said.
In nearby Davao Oriental province, 51 people died, mostly in floods, while two men perished when fierce wind ripped their boat from its mooring and it sank on central Siquijor island, according to disaster-response officials.
Bopha, one of the strongest typhoons to hit the country this year, struck Davao Oriental at dawn on Tuesday then barreled across southern and central provinces, triggering landslides, flooding and cutting off power in two entire provinces. It was roaring toward western Palawan province on Wednesday and was expected to blow out toward the South China Sea the next day."
other,"In light of the effects of the continuing public health crisis on the economy and the associated risks to the outlook, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent since March 2020, when the global pandemic led the Committee to quickly lower the target range to the effective lower bound (figure 49).15 In its revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, issued in August, the Committee reaffirmed its commitment to achieving maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run and noted that ""following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time"" so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. (See the box ""The FOMC's Revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy."") The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved and has indicated that it expects it will be appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."
wildfires,"The Texas wildfires are adding economic trauma to a state that has already suffered billions of dollars in agricultural damages from an ongoing drought.
Wildfire damages to homeowners could exceed $100 million, a record high for the state, according to Mark Hanna, spokesman for the Insurance Council of Texas.
""The fire losses for 2011 are already the worst on record in Texas,"" said Hanna in a press release. ""These wildfires over the Labor Day weekend will only add to what has become a catastrophic year for Texas.""
This is above and beyond the economic damages of at least $5.2 billion from the drought, according to Travis Miller, professor in the soil and crop sciences department at Texas A&M University. He said the multibillion-dollar figure applies to year-to-date losses as of Aug. 15, and the true cost has ""surely exceeded that by now.""
The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas painted a grim portrait of the drought's impact on agriculture:
""Comments from bankers noted widespread negative impacts of the dry conditions -- low or nonexistent yields for many dryland crops, stress to irrigated crops and very poor pasture conditions,"" the bank said in its second-quarter survey of credit conditions.
The Dallas Fed also noted that many ranchers are sending their cattle to the slaughterhouse earlier than they normally would, pressured by bone-dry pastureland.
""Respondents in several regions mentioned that farmers will likely collect crop insurance money to offset drought losses,"" the bank said. ""There were numerous reports of ranchers liquidating their cattle herds due to inadequate grazing conditions and a lack of surface water.""
Miller said farmers are slaughtering cattle so they don't have to keep feeding them, since the Texas hay harvest has been ravaged by the drought.
""Ranchers are trying to sell their cattle because they don't have feed or hay,"" he said. ""Feed prices are just ridiculous. We're trucking hay in from Missouri. It just doesn't make economic sense to keep feeding cattle at those prices."""

A circular in this regard shall be issued by June 30, 2018.After a careful analysis of the Housing Loans data, it has been observed that the level of NPAs for the ticket size of up to Rupees two lakh has been high and is rising briskly. Banks need to strengthen their screening and follow up in respect of lending to this segment in particular. The Reserve Bank is closely monitoring this sector and will consider appropriate policy response such as a tightening of the LTV ratios and/or an increase in the risk weights, should the need arise.Core Investment Companies (CICs) registered with the Reserve Bank as Non-Bank Financial Companies (NBFCs) primarily invest in group companies and do not carry out any other NBFC activity. They are required to invest in group companies in the form of equity shares, preference shares, bonds, debentures, debt or loans, at least up to 90 per cent of their net assets, while equity investments in group companies must constitute at least 60 per cent of net assets. In order to promote infrastructure development through investment in InvITs, it has been decided to enable CICs to act as sponsors to InvIT issuances and permit them to reckon their holdings of InvIT units as sponsors as part of the sub-limit of 60 percent for equity investments in group companies. Exposure of such CICs towards InvITs shall be limited to their holdings as sponsors and shall not, at any point in time, exceed the minimum limit in terms of amount and tenor prescribed in this regard by Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) (Infrastructure Investment Trusts) Regulations, 2014.

other,"North Carolina is one step away from raising the minimum age at which children in the state can wed from 14 to 16 after lawmakers there approved a measure that would change several key rules around child marriages in the state.

Senate Bill 35 was unanimously passed by the state's Senate on Tuesday after it cleared the state's House last week, where it also received unanimous support. The bill now heads to Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who is poised to sign it into law.
""While the legislation falls short of raising the age of marriage to 18, the governor supports this step toward ending child marriage in North Carolina and more protections for children,"" Mary Scott Winstead, a spokeswoman for the governor, said in a statement to CNN on Wednesday.
Currently, girls as young as 14 who are pregnant or expecting can get married to the babies' fathers in North Carolina if they receive permission from judges, and boys as young as 14 can also legally marry the mothers of their born or unborn babies if they're similarly granted permission from judges. But under SB35, the minimum age at which a minor could wed would be 16, with children that age or 17 needing either permission from parents or guardians or approval from judges to tie the knot.
The judge's approval would come only after they determined that ""the marriage will serve the best interest of an underage party,"" according to the legislation, which also requires the age gap between a 16- or 17-year-old and their prospective spouse to be no more than four years.
f signed by Cooper, the measure would go into effect immediately and would apply to marriage licenses ""pending or issued on or after"" the date he approved it.
While the legislation doesn't ban child marriages outright, it would move the state closer in line with rules set by other states around the US that require parental approval for minors to get married."

other,"The MPC noted that incoming data suggest that the transitory effects of demonetisation have lingered on in price formations relating to salient food items, entangled with excess supply conditions with respect to fruits and vegetables, pulses and cereals. At the same time, however, the CSO¡¯s latest releases on national income accounts and industrial production attest to the effects of demonetisation on the broader economy being sector specific and transient, as well as to the noteworthy resilience of private consumption. At this stage, it is difficult to isolate these factors or to judge the strength of their persistence. As the year progresses, underlying inflation pressures, especially input costs, wages and imported inflation, will have to be closely and continuously monitored.Noting that inflation has fallen below 4 per cent only since November 2016, the MPC remains focused on its commitment to keeping headline inflation close to 4 per cent on a durable basis keeping in mind the output gap. The current state of the economy underscores the need to revive private investment, restore banking sector health and remove infrastructural bottlenecks. Monetary policy can play a more effective role only when these factors are in place. Premature action at this stage risks disruptive policy reversals later and the loss of credibility. Accordingly, the MPC decided to keep the policy rate unchanged with a neutral stance and remain watchful of incoming data.The Reserve Bank will continue to work in partnership with the government to address the stress in banks¡¯ balance sheets. Better alignment of administered interest rates on small savings with market rates and stepped-up recapitalisation of banks to facilitate adequate flow of credit to productive sectors are important steps to follow through."

Yet to more than 5,000 people the Taal Volcano is home. A lush island dotted with dozens of craters in the middle of a shimmering lake, the volcano roared into action Sunday with a mighty eruption that shot rocks, ash and steam miles into the sky just hours after the inhabitants of its four villages fled on a flotilla of boats. A man who defied official warnings about the ongoing eruption to sneak back to the island to check on his pigs, says there is complete devastation."

other,"In April 2016, MAS reduced the slope of the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER) policy band to zero percent. There was no change to the width of the policy band or the level at which it was centred. This policy stance was assessed to be appropriate given the more modest outlook for economic growth in 2016 as well as the expectation that MAS Core Inflation would average slightly below 2% in the medium term.Since April 2016, the S$NEER has fluctuated mainly in the upper half of the policy band, reflecting weakness in some regional currencies, as well as the Pound Sterling. The S$NEER peaked in early August, and has more recently depreciated towards the mid-point of the policy band. The average level of the S$NEER over the last six months has been higher than that in the six months prior to April, notwithstanding the 0% slope in the S$NEER policy band."
other,"Monetary policy has lived under many guises. But however it may appear, it generally boils down to adjusting the supply of money in the economy to achieve some combination of inflation and output stabilization.Most economists would agree that in the long run, output¡ªusually measured by gross domestic product (GDP)¡ªis fixed, so any changes in the money supply only cause prices to change. But in the short run, because prices and wages usually do not adjust immediately, changes in the money supply can affect the actual production of goods and services. This is why monetary policy¡ªgenerally conducted by central banks such as the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) or the European Central Bank (ECB)¡ªis a meaningful policy tool for achieving both inflation and growth objectives.In a recession, for example, consumers stop spending as much as they used to; business production declines, leading firms to lay off workers and stop investing in new capacity; and foreign appetite for the country¡¯s exports may also fall. In short, there is a decline in overall, or aggregate, demand to which government can respond with a policy that leans against the direction in which the economy is headed. Monetary policy is often that countercyclical tool of choice.Such a countercyclical policy would lead to the desired expansion of output (and employment), but, because it entails an increase in the money supply, would also result in an increase in prices. As an economy gets closer to producing at full capacity, increasing demand will put pressure on input costs, including wages. Workers then use their increased income to buy more goods and services, further bidding up prices and wages and pushing generalized inflation upward¡ªan outcome policymakers usually want to avoid."
drought,"Major cities across Turkey face running out of water in the next few months, with warnings Istanbul has less than 45 days of water left.
Poor rainfall has led to the country’s most severe drought in a decade and left the megacity of 17 million people with critically low levels of water, according to Turkey’s chamber of chemical engineers. The Ankara mayor, Mansur Yava?, said earlier this month the capital had another 110 days’ worth in dams and reservoirs.
?zmir and Bursa, Turkey’s next two biggest cities, are also struggling, with dams that are about 36% and 24% full respectively, and farmers in wheat-producing areas such as the Konya plain and Edirne province on the border with Greece and Bulgaria are warning of crop failure.
The acute lack of rainfall in the second half of 2020 _ approaching 50% year on year for November _ led the religious affairs directorate to instruct imams and their congregations to pray for rain last month.
Turkey is a “water stressed” country, with just 1,346 cubic metres of water per capita per year, and has faced several droughts since the 1980s due to a combination of population growth, industrialisation, urban sprawl and climate change.
“Instead of focusing on measures to keep water demand under control, Turkey insists on expanding its water supply through building more dams  Turkey has built hundreds of dams in the last two decades,” said Dr Akgün ?lhan, a water management expert at the Istanbul Policy Center.
“The warning signs have been there for decades but not much has been done in practice.”
Turkey has long prioritised economic growth over environmental concerns and remains the only G20 country apart from the US yet to ratify the 2015 Paris agreement."
drought,"Rivers ravaged by a lengthy drought may not be able to recover, even after the rains return. Seven years after the Millennium drought baked southeastern Australia, a large fraction of the region’s rivers still show no signs of returning to their predrought water flow, researchers report in the May 14 Science.
There’s “an implicit assumption that no matter how big a disturbance is, the water will always come back — it’s just a matter of how long it takes,” says Tim Peterson, a hydrologist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. “I’ve never been satisfied with that.”
The years-long drought in southeastern Australia, which began sometime between 1997 and 2001 and lasted until 2010, offered a natural experiment to test this assumption, he says. “It wasn’t the most severe drought” the region has ever experienced, but it was the longest period of low rainfall in the region since about 1900.
Peterson and colleagues analyzed annual and seasonal streamflow rates in 161 river basins in the region from before, during and after the drought. By 2017, they found, 37 percent of those river basins still weren’t seeing the amount of water flow that they had predrought. Furthermore, of those low-flow rivers, the vast majority — 80 percent — also show no signs that they might recover in the future, the team found."
earthquake,"Japan's huge earthquake brought super-modern Tokyo to a standstill Friday, paralyzing trains that normally run like clockwork and stranding hordes of commuters carrying mobile phones rendered largely useless by widespread outages.
The magnitude-8.9 quake off Japan's northeastern coast shook buildings in the capital, left millions of homes across Japan without electricity, shut down the mobile phone network and severely disrupted landline telephone service. It brought Tokyo's train system to a halt, choking a daily commuter flow of more than 10 million people.
""This is the kind of earthquake that hits once every 100 years,"" said restaurant worker Akira Tanaka, 54.
He gave up waiting for trains to resume and decided - for his first time ever - to set off on foot for his home 12 miles (20 kilometers) north of the capital. ""I've been walking an hour and 10 minutes, still have about three hours to go,"" he said.
Tokyo prides itself on being an orderly, technologically savvy, even futuristic city. Residents usually can rely on a huge, criss-crossing network of train and subway lines. But after the mid-afternoon quake, authorities were forced to scan the entire web for quake damage and canceled nearly all train service for the rest of the day.
Tens of thousands of people milled at train stations, roamed the streets or hunkered down at 24-hour cafes, hotels and government offices offered as emergency accommodations."

A series of aftershocks around the country followed. A magnitude 5.0 aftershock struck 27 kilometers (about 16.8 miles) south-southwest of Nueve de Julio, around 1,000 km (620 miles) east of the first quake and almost 20 minutes later. Then, a magnitude 4.9 quake came in the same area as the first, followed by a magnitude 5.3 aftershock. The 4.9, 5.0 and 5.3-magnitude quakes are considered aftershocks as they are smaller in magnitude than the main quake and in the same area. No injuries have been reported so far, according to San Juan Governor Sergio U_ac. Based on available data, there is no tsunami threat at this time, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC). Speaking at a press conference early Tuesday, U_ac said local authorities are still analyzing the damage, which impacted streets and highways in the province. Some locations experienced power cuts, and homes experienced damage in the town of Caucete. Four people had to be evacuated from their homes in the town of Zonda, in San Juan. The governor added that the electricity service is now gradually being reestablished. No public buildings have been damaged; some hospitals reported broken glass, but experienced no major structural damage. U_ac urged people to stay calm after the quakes hit. ""Let's put into practice all the measures that we have learned to prevent incidents, while we are committed to knowing the impact of the (earthquake) to collaborate in everything necessary,"" he tweeted. He added that the province was working with civil and security forces to respond, as well as with municipalities to respond to ""take care of them."""

drought,"Droughts and other climate-related weather events have a significant negative impact on food security, conflict and migration. Many regions in sub-Saharan Africa, including some of the poorest countries in the world, are particularly susceptible to droughts and need help to overcome them. Unfortunately, many countries and international community continue to regard droughts as unpredictable ""crises"" and often react with poorly coordinated emergency aid measures only after the damage was done.
The event will discuss the links between drought, food insecurity, conflict and migration. Droughts bring negative impacts in many ways, from poverty to food security, resource protection and energy supply. Conflicts around scarce water and support are pre-programmed. With increasing globalization, more and more people are indirectly affected, especially by the spread of local conflicts and unplanned mass migration. The event illuminates how droughts are linked, and the limits of sectoral policy approaches.
In addition, the need for proactive approaches to mitigate of the effects of droughts will be addressed. The complexity of the subject calls for a close dialogue between scientists and developmental practitioners to challenge conventional knowledge, to evaluate old solutions and to find new solutions."
other,"In October 2013, MAS maintained the modest and gradual appreciation path of the S$NEER policy band, with no change to its slope, width, and the level at which it was centred.  This policy stance, which has been in place since April 2012, was assessed to be appropriate, taking into account the balance of risks between external demand uncertainties and rising domestic inflationary pressures.Over the last six months, the S$NEER generally eased towards the mid-point of the policy band.  The S$NEER initially appreciated over October and November on account of the decline in major currencies, which in turn reflected the fiscal impasse in the US and expectations of further quantitative easing in Japan.  However, it weakened following the announcement that the US Federal Reserve would begin to taper its asset purchase program.  Geo-political events and the slowdown in China¡¯s growth also added to the downward pressure on the S$NEER.  More recently, the exchange rate has strengthened slightly.  Throughout the period, global liquidity conditions remained highly accommodative. The three-month S$ SIBOR was stable at around 0.40%, while the three-month US$ LIBOR averaged 0.24%."
other,"In October 2015, MAS kept the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER) policy band on a modest and gradual appreciation path, but reduced its rate of appreciation slightly. There was no change to the width of the policy band or the level at which it was centred. This policy stance was assessed to be supportive of economic growth into 2016, while ensuring price stability over the medium term.    Since October 2015, the S$NEER has fluctuated around a strengthening trend, appreciating from below the mid-point of the policy band to the upper half of the band. Following a bout of depreciation pressures in January 2016 amid heightened global risk aversion, the S$NEER strengthened on broad-based US$ weakness, as financial markets revised downwards their expectations of the US Federal Reserve¡¯s pace of interest rate normalisation. However, the average level of the S$NEER over the last six months as a whole has been unchanged compared to the six months prior to October 2015."
drought,"The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow On (GRACE-FO) satellites showed indications of drought in European groundwater in a map taken on June 22, 2020.
According to the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), meteorological drought conditions began in eastern Europe in early spring 2020, then affected other parts of the continent with drier-than-usual weather in April and May. In late May and June, surface soil moisture and waterways recovered a bit after heavy showers.
In a seasonal review and forecast, C3S meteorologists forecast below-average precipitation for southern and eastern Europe in June, July, and August. The GEOGLAM Crop Monitor, a Group on Earth Observations, put most of central and eastern Europe, as well as southwestern Russia, under a watch for potential drought impacts on wheat production.
The GRACE-FO satellites presented a map showing shallow groundwater storage and root zone soil moisture in Europe as of June 22, 2020. The colors depict the wetness percentile. Blue areas have more water than normal, while orange and red areas have less. Darkest reds depict dry conditions that should take place only about once in every 50 years.
""Monitoring root zone moisture is essential for managing agriculture because it is the water naturally available for growing crops,"" Michael Carlowicz of NASA's Earth Observatory noted.
""Soil moisture at Earth’s surface and in the root zone can fluctuate significantly over short periods of time; it can be quickly replenished by rainfall, but also can evaporate rapidly during heat waves and dry spells. In fact, recent rains in parts of Europe have significantly reduced surface moisture deficits."""

Yet the National Hurricane Center only included the very western fringe of the state in its predicted zone of where the storm center might pass, nowhere in the vicinity of Portsmouth. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters Friday that the campaign rally was being delayed due to a “big storm” expected in Portsmouth, when forecasts from the National Weather Service showed just periodic showers and light winds likely tapering off by evening. The National Weather Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the forecast information provided by Trump and McEnany."
wildfires,"The number of Alaska's active wildfires is literally off the charts, according to a map recently released by the state's Division of Forestry.
Over 700 fires have burned so far this summer, the most in the state's history, and that number is only expected to get bigger as the state is experiencing higher temperatures, lower humidity and more lightning storms than usual, said Kale Casey, a public information officer for the Alaska Interagency Coordination Center, which serves as a focal point for state agencies involved in wildland fire management and suppression.
""Exactly around 1.88 million acres of land have been burned so far, which is at pace with the 2004 season when 6.59 million acres burned,"" Casey told ABC News today. ""In addition to the dry season we're having, we've had a huge amount of lightning -- about 6,000 to 10,000 bolts per day. There was three-day period in June where we had over 31,000 lightning strikes."""
wildfires,"Firefighters have beaten back parts of the nine blazes raging in southern California, allowing thousands of displaced locals to return to the area.
But a flare-up of a wildfire in San Marcos prompted more than 13,000 new evacuation notices to residents.
The fires have destroyed at least 18 houses and two businesses and caused more than $20m (?12m) in damage.
A badly burned body was found in Carlsbad, but no details were available on its identity or cause of death.
Schools across the region were closed and a nuclear plant and a military base were earlier evacuated.
Months of drought have made California particularly prone to fire this year, and the crews managing the evacuations and battling the blazes have had to contend with sweltering heat.
But calmer winds on Thursday allowed aircraft - including four air tankers and 22 military helicopters - to be deployed to fight the flames.
The Legoland theme park in Carlsbad was closed earlier due to power surges, while San Onofre nuclear power plant briefly evacuated non-essential staff as a precautionary measure.
And the campus of California State University-San Marcos, with almost 10,000 students, was shut down amid the university's final exams, with all commencement ceremonies cancelled.
Fires also hit the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton, between San Diego and Los Angeles.
Carlsbad fire chief Michael Davies said such fires were unprecedented this time of year."
other,"The U.S. economy grew at a solid pace over the second half of 2017 and into this year. Monthly job gains averaged 179,000 from July through December, and payrolls rose an additional 200,000 in January. This pace of job growth was sufficient to push the unemployment rate down to 4.1 percent, about 3/4 percentage point lower than a year earlier and the lowest level since December 2000. In addition, the labor force participation rate remained roughly unchanged, on net, as it has for the past several years--that is a sign of job market strength, given that retiring baby boomers are putting downward pressure on the participation rate. Strong job gains in recent years have led to widespread reductions in unemployment across the income spectrum and for all major demographic groups. For example, the unemployment rate for adults without a high school education has fallen from about 15 percent in 2009 to 5-1/2 percent in January of this year, while the jobless rate for those with a college degree has moved down from 5 percent to 2 percent over the same period. In addition, unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanics are now at or below rates seen before the recession, although they are still significantly above the rate for whites. Wages have continued to grow moderately, with a modest acceleration in some measures, although the extent of the pickup likely has been damped in part by the weak pace of productivity growth in recent years."
other,"Several high-frequency indicators of services activity increased at a faster pace in May-June. Tractor and two-wheeler sales growth accelerated significantly, suggesting strong rural demand. Passenger vehicle sales growth, an indicator of urban demand, also strengthened. Commercial vehicle sales growth remained robust despite some deceleration. Domestic air passenger traffic _ another indicator of urban demand _ maintained double-digit growth. Construction activity indicators also improved with cement production sustaining double digit growth for the eighth consecutive month in June. Steel consumption also accelerated in May. The services PMI expanded to a twelve-month high in June, after a marginal contraction in May, supported by expansion in new business and employment.Retail inflation, measured by the year-on-year change in the CPI, rose from 4.9 per cent in May to 5 per cent in June, driven by an uptick in inflation in fuel and in items other than food and fuel even as food inflation remained muted due to lower than usual seasonal uptick in prices of fruits and vegetables in summer months. Adjusting for the estimated impact of the 7th central pay commission¡¯s house rent allowances (HRA), headline inflation increased from 4.5 per cent in May to 4.6 per cent in June. Low inflation continued in cereals, meat, milk, oil, spices and non-alcoholic beverages, and pulses and sugar prices remained in deflation.Fuel and light group inflation rose sharply, pulled up by liquefied petroleum gas and kerosene. Inflation in firewood and chips ticked up, while electricity inflation remained low. The pass-through of global crude oil prices impacted inflation in domestic petroleum products as well as transport services. Inflation also picked up modestly in respect of education and health.The June round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s survey of households reported a further uptick of 20 basis points in inflation expectations for both three-month and one-year ahead horizons as compared with the last round. Manufacturing firms polled in the Reserve Bank¡¯s industrial outlook survey (IOS) reported higher input costs and selling prices in Q1:2018-19. The manufacturing PMI showed that input prices eased slightly in July, although they remained high. Input costs for companies polled in Services PMI in June also stayed elevated. Farm and non-farm input costs rose significantly. Notwithstanding some pick-up in February and March 2018, rural wage growth remained moderate, while wage growth in the organised sector remained firm."
earthquake,"An earthquake measuring a preliminary magnitude of 6.0 struck Thursday in waters off the south coast of Panama, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
The quake was recorded around 9:42 GMT Thursday at a depth of 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) under the northern Pacific Ocean, some 150 kilometers (93 miles) southeast of Punta de Burica, Panama.
The USGS said little or no population was exposed to the quake. No tsunami warning has been issued.
No other details were immediately available."
other,"Retail inflation measured by the consumer price index (CPI) dropped sharply in February after rising for six consecutive months. This favourable development was due to a larger than anticipated decline in vegetable prices, helped by prices of pulses starting to come off the surge that began in August, and effective supply management that helped limit cereal price increases. Accordingly, food inflation eased for the first time in the second half of 2015-16. Notably, this occurred on a decline in prices rather than favourable base effects, which were at work in the first half of the year. Inflation in the fuel group moderated across electricity, kerosene, cooking gas and firewood, the latter easing pressures on rural inflation. Three months ahead household inflation expectations declined to a single digit for the second consecutive round of the survey in response to these dynamics.CPI inflation excluding food and fuel edged up in February, mainly under housing, education, personal care and transport and communication, suggesting capacity constraints in the services sector. Excluding petrol and diesel from this category, inflation stayed elevated and persistent at or above 5 per cent, indicating a possible resistance level for further downward movements in the headline. The stubborn underlying inflation momentum is unlikely to be helped by the 7th Pay Commission award and the effects of the one-rank-one-pension (OROP) award, or by the cost-push effect of the increase in the service tax rate. However, rural wage growth as well as the rate of increase in corporate staff costs was moderate. Also, input and output prices polled in purchasing managers¡¯ surveys rose modestly for manufacturing and services."
other,"Currently available information suggests that the global economy has continued to recover, but the pace of recovery has been slow due to the ongoing resurgence of COVID19. In global financial markets, risk aversion has subsided on improvement of economic indicators and hopes for coronavirus vaccine development. Stock prices in major countries and government bond yields have risen and the US dollar has weakened. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the severity of the resurgence of COVID-19 and the status of vaccine development, as well as by national policy responses and their effects. The Korean economy has continued to recover at a modest pace. Although the recovery in private consumption has been slow and the correction in construction investment has continued, facilities investment has started to recover and the improvement in exports has continued. Labor market conditions have remained weak, with the number of persons employed continuing to decline sharply compared to the corresponding period last year. Going forward, the economy is likely to recover gradually, led mainly by exports and investment. However, uncertainties surrounding the economic outlook are judged to remain elevated. GDP is projected to grow at slightly below -1% in 2020 and around 3% in 2021. Consumer price inflation has slowed to the lower-0% level due to the sharp decline in the prices of public services. Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) recorded a negative rate, and the inflation expectations of the general public have moved down slightly within the upper-1% range. It is forecast that consumer price inflation and core inflation will run at the low- to mid-0% level for some time and then moderately increase to around 1% in 2021. In domestic financial markets, stock prices have risen considerably and the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate has fallen significantly while long-term market interest rates have risen, affected by various factors such as global financial market movements and improvement of economic indicators. Household loan growth has picked up and housing prices have continued to increase in all parts of the country. The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to support the economy and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As the recovery in the Korean economy is expected to be modest and inflationary pressures on the demand side are forecast to remain weak, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance. In this process it will thoroughly assess developments related to the pandemic, the impact on the economy and financial markets here and abroad, changes in financial stability such as household debt growth, and the effects of the policy measures taken in response to the pandemic."
other," Against continuing weakness and uncertainties in the external economic environment, the strength of the recovery in the Singapore economy is expected to be moderate beyond the initial uplift.  While there could be some upward pressures on consumer prices emanating from higher global oil and food prices, underlying domestic cost pressures will be contained. MAS will therefore maintain the current policy stance of a zero percent appreciation of the S$NEER policy path.  There will be no change to the width of the policy band and the level at which it is centred.  MAS will continue to be vigilant over developments in the external environment including the medium-term risk of stronger global inflationary pressures."
valcano eruption,"Japan's Mt. Ontake Is Still Erupting As Questions Emerge About Warnings The volcano whose eruption surprised hikers in central Japan this weekend sent a plume of ash and gas more than 1,500 feet into the air Monday as it continued to erupt, officials say. That has complicated efforts to find victims and survivors, and rescue efforts have again been halted. At least 36 people are feared dead in the eruption that hit just before noon Saturday, stranding people who had been ascending Mt. Ontake to take in views of the colorful fall foliage. They suddenly found themselves in peril, as the volcano erupted and a huge cloud of ash rolled down the mountain. More than 200 people eventually reached safety, but officials are unsure how many others might still be on the mountain. They're reportedly investigating cars that are still parked in lots near the mountain's base for clues to how many hikers remain stranded on its heights."
other,"Since I last reported to this Committee in mid-2012, economic activity in the United States has continued to expand at a moderate if somewhat uneven pace. In particular, real gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have risen at an annual rate of about 3 percent in the third quarter but to have been essentially flat in the fourth quarter.1 The pause in real GDP growth last quarter does not appear to reflect a stalling-out of the recovery. Rather, economic activity was temporarily restrained by weather-related disruptions and by transitory declines in a few volatile categories of spending, even as demand by U.S. households and businesses continued to expand. Available information suggests that economic growth has picked up again this year.Consistent with the moderate pace of economic growth, conditions in the labor market have been improving gradually. Since July, nonfarm payroll employment has increased by 175,000 jobs per month on average, and the unemployment rate declined 0.3 percentage point to 7.9 percent over the same period. Cumulatively, private-sector payrolls have now grown by about 6.1 million jobs since their low point in early 2010, and the unemployment rate has fallen a bit more than 2 percentage points since its cyclical peak in late 2009. Despite these gains, however, the job market remains generally weak, with the unemployment rate well above its longer-run normal level. About 4.7 million of the unemployed have been without a job for six months or more, and millions more would like full-time employment but are able to find only part-time work. High unemployment has substantial costs, including not only the hardship faced by the unemployed and their families, but also the harm done to the vitality and productive potential of our economy as a whole. Lengthy periods of unemployment and underemployment can erode workers' skills and attachment to the labor force or prevent young people from gaining skills and experience in the first place--developments that could significantly reduce their productivity and earnings in the longer term. The loss of output and earnings associated with high unemployment also reduces government revenues and increases spending, thereby leading to larger deficits and higher levels of debt.The recent increase in gasoline prices, which reflects both higher crude oil prices and wider refining margins, is hitting family budgets. However, overall inflation remains low. Over the second half of 2012, the price index for personal consumption expenditures rose at an annual rate of 1-1/2 percent, similar to the rate of increase in the first half of the year. Measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained in the narrow ranges seen over the past several years. Against this backdrop, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective."
other,"From late 2015 through the first half of last year, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) gradually increased its target range for the federal funds rate as the economy continued to make progress toward the Committee's congressionally mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability. In the second half of 2018, the FOMC continued this gradual process of monetary policy normalization, raising the federal funds rate at its September and December meetings, bringing the target range to 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent (figure 45).14 The FOMC's decisions to increase the federal funds rate reflected the solid performance of the U.S. economy, the continued strengthening of the labor market, and the fact that inflation had moved near the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective."
other,"The Federal Reserve's response to this extraordinary period is guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system. We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy in this challenging time.In March, we quickly lowered our policy interest rate to near zero, reflecting the effects of COVID-19 on economic activity, employment, and inflation, and the heightened risks to the outlook. We expect to maintain interest rates at this level until we are confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.We have also been taking broad and forceful actions to support the flow of credit in the economy. Since March, we have been purchasing sizable quantities of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities in order to support the smooth functioning of these markets, which are vital to the flow of credit in the economy. As described in the June Monetary Policy Report, these purchases have helped restore orderly market conditions and have fostered more accommodative financial conditions. As market functioning has improved since the strains experienced in March, we have gradually reduced the pace of these purchases. To sustain smooth market functioning and thereby foster the effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions, we will increase our holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities over coming months at least at the current pace. We will closely monitor developments and are prepared to adjust our plans as appropriate to support our goals.To provide stability to the financial system and support the flow of credit to households, businesses, and state and local governments, the Federal Reserve, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, established 11 credit and liquidity facilities under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. The June Monetary Policy Report provides details on these facilities, which fall into two categories: stabilizing short-term funding markets and providing more-direct support for credit across the economy.To help stabilize short-term funding markets, the Federal Reserve set up the Commercial Paper Funding Facility and the Money Market Liquidity Facility to stem rapid outflows from prime money market funds. The Fed also established the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, which provides loans against good collateral to primary dealers that are critical intermediaries in short-term funding markets.To more directly support the flow of credit to households, businesses, and state and local governments, the Federal Reserve established a number of facilities. To support the small business sector, we established the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility to bolster the effectiveness of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act's (CARES Act) Paycheck Protection Program. Our Main Street Lending Program, which we are in the process of launching, supports lending to both small and midsized businesses. The Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility supports lending to both businesses and consumers. To support the employment and spending of investment-grade businesses, we established two corporate credit facilities. And to help U.S. state and local governments manage cash flow pressures and serve their communities, we set up the Municipal Liquidity Facility.The tools that the Federal Reserve is using under its 13(3) authority are appropriately reserved for times of emergency. When this crisis is behind us, we will put them away. The June Monetary Policy Report reviews the implications of these tools for the Federal Reserve's balance sheet.Many of these facilities have been supported by funding from the CARES Act. We will be disclosing, on a monthly basis, names and details of participants in each such facility; amounts borrowed and interest rate charged; and overall costs, revenues, and fees for each facility. We embrace our responsibility to the American people to be as transparent as possible, and we appreciate that the need for transparency is heightened when we are called upon to use our emergency powers.We recognize that our actions are only part of a broader public-sector response. Congress's passage of the CARES Act was critical in enabling the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department to establish many of the lending programs. The CARES Act and other legislation provide direct help to people, businesses, and communities. This direct support can make a critical difference not just in helping families and businesses in a time of need, but also in limiting long-lasting damage to our economy.I want to end by acknowledging the tragic events that have again put a spotlight on the pain of racial injustice in this country. The Federal Reserve serves the entire nation. We operate in, and are part of, many of the communities across the country where Americans are grappling with and expressing themselves on issues of racial equality. I speak for my colleagues throughout the Federal Reserve System when I say, there is no place at the Federal Reserve for racism and there should be no place for it in our society. Everyone deserves the opportunity to participate fully in our society and in our economy."
Typhoon,"Tropical Storm Gonzalo sets a record as it churns toward the Caribbean (CNN)Tropical Depression Seven strengthened into Tropical Storm Gonzalo on Wednesday, according to the National Hurricane Center. At 5 p.m. ET, the storm was about 1,110 miles east of the southern Windward Islands, packing winds of 50 mph and moving to the west at 14 mph. ""Given the increased organization of the system and its small size, Gonzalo's (pronounced gohn-SAH-loh) likelihood of becoming a hurricane is rising. Small storms are prone to more significant fluctuations in intensity, both up and down,"" CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward said. Strengthening will continue in the next day as the storm is expected to become the season's first hurricane by Thursday, the NHC said. The center is forecasting the storm to weaken slightly before moving over the Windward Islands. The storm may even fizzle after it moves over the islands, as many models are indicating, or it could continue to intensify into next week. It's still a little too early to tell exactly what it will do after it moves into the Caribbean. This is the earliest that a storm has received a name starting with the letter ""G"" since the United States began using a named-storm system in 1953. On average, the seventh named storm in a season is on September 16."
Typhoon,"Thousands of people in Vietnam sought shelter as a powerful tropical storm barrelled towards its northern coast on Friday, after killing 43 people in the Philippines and slamming into southeast China. Beijing, which had issued its first red typhoon alert of the year, downgraded Typhoon Nesat to a ""strong tropical storm"" as it slowed at sea, after forcing 300,000 people to evacuate on the tropical island of Hainan. Gale force winds and torrential rain continued to lash China's southeast coast on Friday and high winds buffeted Hanoi, where forecasters said Nesat would hit Vietnam's northeast coast in the afternoon. In the Philippines, tens of thousands of people battled neck-deep floodwaters after Nesat's deadly path across Luzon. The government there said nearly a million people had been affected by the flooding and that another typhoon, Nalgae, was forecast to dump more rain across the main island of Luzon from Saturday. Severe floods have also devastated swathes of Southeast Asia, with eight people, mostly children, reported dead in Vietnam's southern Mekong Delta provinces. Unusually severe monsoon rains have killed almost 190 people in Thailand over the past two months and claimed more than 100 lives in Cambodia."
wildfires,"Authorities are keeping a close eye on a bushfire in the Barmah Forest, near Nathalia, in northern Victoria.
The 39-hectare blaze started late yesterday in Hughes Lane at Yielima and it took 100 firefighters until just after midnight to contain it.
There are concerns the fire could flare up after a strong southerly wind change.
The cause of the fire is under investigation.
CFA incident controller, Phil Hawkey, says it is expected to take some time to extinguish.
""There's a number of large older trees that are hollow trees that are burning,"" he said.
""These trees are creating issues with us because they're spreading embers and so forth and they're going to continue burning through the day and possibly for the next few days."""
valcano eruption,"At least five people were killed and eight more are still missing following a deadly volcanic eruption on New Zealand's White Island Monday. The country's Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, said citizens from New Zealand, Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, China and Malaysia were among those injured and missing following the explosion. Speaking at a news conference on Tuesday morning, local time, Ardern paid tribute to the people who tried to help visitors caught up in the eruption. ""Those who undertook a risky effort in the immediate aftermath did so in an incredibly courageous way,"" she said. According to New Zealand Police Superintendent Bruce Bird, 47 people were on the island at the time of the explosion. He said 31 are still in hospital, while three others have been treated and discharged. The eruption took place with little warning Monday afternoon local time while dozens of tourists from cruise ship Ovation of the Seas were touring the volcano."
other,"Growth of Australia's major trading partners was around its long-run average in 2014. It appears to have eased slightly in the early months of 2015. Commodity prices have been quite volatile over recent months, notably iron ore and oil prices, which have rebounded somewhat from recent lows. Even so, prices of Australia's key commodity exports overall have declined since the beginning of 2015 and are well down on levels of a year ago. In large part, the declines reflect growth in the supply of commodities globally, although an easing of growth in China's demand for some key commodities has also played a role. While there has been a further fall in Australia's terms of trade, the Australian dollar has appreciated by around 3 per cent against the US dollar and in trade-weighted terms since the previous Statement.In China, economic growth has eased further. The Chinese property market remains a source of weakness in the economy and this is flowing through to weaker demand for steel and other construction-related products. Indicators for Japanese economic activity have been somewhat mixed early this year, though labour market conditions remain tight and there are tentative signs that wage growth will rise, which is expected to underpin a pick-up in domestic price pressures. Economic growth in the rest of east Asia looks to have slowed a little in the March quarter. Growth in the US economy moderated in the March quarter, largely reflecting the temporary effects of disruptions related to severe weather and industrial action in West Coast ports. Meanwhile, the US labour market has continued to improve and wage growth has picked up. Economic activity in the euro area is recovering at a gradual pace."
other,"Aggregate demand has been underpinned by the strengthening of private consumption and investment demand. The drag from external demand has reduced with a robust pick-up in non-oil merchandise exports. Aggregate supply conditions improved with a sharp acceleration in manufacturing and the resilience in agriculture and allied activities. Raising real investment activity on a durable basis holds the key to sustaining the growth momentum, going forward.Since the start of 2018, i.e., from the January-March 2018 quarter, economic activity in India appears to be charting a step-up in its trajectory. Quarterly estimates of the Central Statistics Office (CSO) for Q1:2018- 19 (April-June) confirm that gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 8 per cent in the January-June 2018 period, up from 6.6 per cent in the period July- December 2017. High frequency and survey-based indicators suggest that aggregate demand is fast catching up with aggregate supply. Sales growth, pick-up in capacity utilisation and the acceleration in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) space attest that the output gap has virtually closed.Meanwhile, another engine of aggregate demand has started to pick-up with the bounce-back in merchandise exports. On the supply side, the rapid catch-up in sowing activity, backed by ample reservoir storage, brightens the outlook for agriculture and allied activities on top of the record production in 2017-18. Industrial activity has strengthened and become more broad-based, buoyed by manufacturing. The services sector remains resilient, supported by strong growth in construction activity as well as public administration, defence and other services (PADO)."
earthquake,"A magnitude 6.4 earthquake struck near Petrinja, Croatia, about 30 miles southeast of the capital of Zagreb, on December 29, 2020 at about 6:20 am Eastern Time (12:20 pm local time). Seismic instruments indicate the earthquake originated at a depth of about 6 miles (10 kilometers).
This is the largest earthquake to occur in Croatia since the advent of modern seismic instruments. An earthquake of similar size occurred in 1880 near Zagreb and three magnitude 6 and larger earthquakes have occurred within 125 miles (200 kilometers) of the December 29, 2020 earthquake since 1900. A magnitude 5.6 earthquake on November 27, 1990, about 110 miles (175 kilometers) to the southeast, injured 10 people.
The USGS has posted an event page providing more details. Perceived shaking for the earthquake was very strong. The preliminary PAGER report is Orange for economic losses, indicating significant damage is likely and the disaster is potentially widespread. This event was also felt in Germany, Italy, Hungary and other nearby countries."
valcano eruption,"Flights between Singapore and Manila cancelled after volcano eruption: 5 things to know about Taal SINGAPORE - A volcanic eruption south of the Philippine capital of Manila on Sunday (Jan 12) resulted in many flights cancelled or rescheduled as Manila's international airport was closed. A massive ash cloud from the eruption drifted north across the city and on Monday, at least 37 flights between Singapore and Manila were affected, even though the Philippine authorities said that flight operations partially resumed on the same day. The affected airlines include Singapore Airlines, Scoot, Jetstar Airways and Philippine Airlines, according to Changi Airport's website."
wildfires,"Greece's prime minister has talked of a ""nightmarish summer"" as forest fires continue to ravage the country.
Thousands have been evacuated from their homes, and more than 1,000 firefighters have been deployed to bring the flames under control.
Greece is experiencing its worst heatwave in more than 30 years.
Authorities have warned that the risk of further fires remains high in many regions, including Athens and Crete.
Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the government's priority has been ""first and foremost , to protect human lives"".
In the last 10 days, more than 56,000 hectares (140,000 acres) have been burnt in Greece, according to the European Forest Fire Information System.
Dozens of wildfires have broken out in the last 24 hours with the largest fronts in Evia - Greece's second largest island - and areas in the Peloponnese including Arkadia and Olympia, the birthplace of the Olympic Games.
In Evia, more than 2,000 people have been evacuated via ferry. Ten ships are waiting at Pefki, in the north of the island, ready to evacuate more people if needed, a Coast Guard spokesperson told AP news agency."
valcano eruption,"and eight people - including New Zealanders and tourists from Australia, Britain, the US, China and Malaysia - are unaccounted for and presumed dead, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Tuesday morning. Later in the day she told Radio New Zealand that ""there will be questions that are being asked, that will need to be answered ... by the appropriate authorities."" ""It's an unpredictable live volcano,"" Ardern said. While national geological hazard monitoring system Geonet tracks the the volcano's activity, the island is privately owned and it is up to tour operators to decide when to visit."
other,"The large increase in MSPs for kharif crops announced by the government in July 2018 can have a direct impact on food inflation and second round effects on headline inflation through relative price adjustments, higher demand on the back of higher rural incomes and increase in inflation expectations. The baseline projections incorporate the likely effect of the increase in MSPs on inflation, assuming normal procurement by the government in line with past trends (Box II.1). However, if procurement operations turn out to be larger than assumed, headline inflation could increase by around 20 bps above the baseline.The baseline projections assume a fiscal stance as announced in the Union and State budgets for 2018-19. Higher MSPs combined with stepped-up food procurement operations and unbudgeted farm loan waivers by states pose upside risks to the fiscal outlook. Should there be fiscal slippage at the centre and/or state levels, it could result in greater market volatility, crowding out of private investment and higher inflation. Quantitative estimates of these risks will, however, be reliant on incoming data right up to the April 2019 MPR.To sum up, real GDP growth is expected to accelerate in 2018-19 vis-¨¤-vis 2017-18, with the pace of growth easing in H2 relative to H1. Stabilisation of the goods and services tax, progress on resolution of distressed assets under the insolvency and bankruptcy code and initiatives towards strengthening of bank balance sheets are supporting economic and investment activity. However, the uncertain global environment poses an important downside risk to the domestic growth outlook.Inflation is expected to pick up from its current levels as the MSPs for kharif crops feed into domestic food inflation and favourable base effects dissipate. Volatile crude oil prices and the volatility in international financial markets pose the primary upside risks to the inflation outlook."
drought,"Up to 5.6 million ha (14 million acres) of crops in Iowa have been battered a powerful derecho that struck parts of the Midwest on August 10, 2020. Northern Illinois University meteorology professor Victor Gensini considers it as one of the worst weather events of 2020 for the country.
A powerful line of severe thunderstorms known as a ""Derecho"" tracked across eastern Iowa and northwest Illinois on the afternoon of Monday, August 10, 2020, producing widespread straight line wind damage. A swath of damage from Benton County, through portions of Linn, Jones, Cedar, and Clinton Counties, is consistent with intermittent straight line winds in the 160 -  210 km/h (100 - 130 mph) range, NWS said.
Maximum estimated winds were around 225 km/h (140 mph), which caused extensive damage to an apartment complex in southwest Cedar Rapids, IA. Straight line winds of this magnitude are equivalent to an EF-3 tornado.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture said a total of 5.6 million ha (14 million acres) of crops in Iowa were affected by the event. Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig specified that 1.6 million ha (4 million acres) of corn have been severely damaged, as well as 1 million ha (2.5 million acres) of soybean.
The storm exacerbated the situation for farmers as Iowa is already experiencing its most widespread drought since September 2013.

other,"Sovereign bond yields in many AEs hardened with the 10-year US sovereign bond yield touching a four-year high in February on expectations of faster rate hikes by the Fed. Recent inward looking policies have also soured investor sentiment and impacted bond yields adversely. In the euro area, the benchmark 10-year German bond yield has risen, though weak inflation numbers in the euro area have exerted some downward pressure. In Japan, bond yields have been falling since February 2018, coming off from a multi-month high on Japan¡¯s yield curve control policy (Chart V.9a). Bond yields in EMEs were driven by country-specific factors, though they have risen recently in most countries on expectations of shrinking global liquidity and pick-up in inflation in the US.Currency markets have been driven mainly by monetary policy stances in the key AEs and macroeconomic data. The US dollar continued to depreciate and fell to a multi-year low in January on improving growth prospects in other regions. Weaker GDP data for Q4:2017 and comments by authorities in January in favour of a weaker dollar also weighed on the currency. In early March, however, the US dollar rose on upbeat views by the Fed on the US economy, but fell again on fears of intensification of trade wars. The euro is trading at its highest level in more than three years on narrowing of growth differentials between the euro area and its peers and the weakening of the US dollar. The Japanese yen touched the highest level against the US dollar since November 2016 on fears of a trade war.The MSCI Emerging Market Currency index hit a two-month high in January 2018 on the US dollar¡¯s weakness, rising commodity prices and a more synchronised growth upturn, along with ebbing political concerns in some of the constituents (Chart V.9b).

Widespread flash flood watches and flood warnings were already in effect over the south-central United States following several days of heavy rainfall, the NWS said, including parts of Arkansas, Mississippi and Oklahoma.  At one point early Wednesday, more than 100,000 customers were without power in Texas, according to the website PowerOutage.us. By evening, that number was at around 17,700 customers."
earthquake,"7.5 magnitude earthquake strikes near Alaska, triggering tsunami advisory A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck off the Alaska Peninsula on Monday afternoon, triggering a tsunami warning in the region. The warning was downgraded to an advisory within a few hours, and then was lifted entirely later Monday after waves about 2 feet high rolled onto the shore in some areas.  Some schools on the peninsula were evacuated earlier in the day, but there were no reports of damage. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake occurred at 1:54 p.m. PT some 56 miles southeast of Sand Hill and nearly 600 miles southwest of Anchorage. The earthquake had a depth of about 25 miles. Several large aftershocks were also recorded at magnitudes 5.8, 5.7, 5.2 and 5.5."
other,"For more than two years, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has been gradually increasing its target range for the federal funds rate as the labor market strengthened and headwinds in the aftermath of the recession continued to abate. After having raised the target range for the federal funds rate twice in the first half of 2017, the Committee raised it again in December, bringing the target range to 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent (figure 43).10 As on previous occasions, the decision to increase the federal funds rate in December reflected realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation relative to the FOMC's objectives. Information available at that time indicated that economic activity had been rising at a solid rate and the labor market had continued to strengthen. In addition, although inflation had continued to run below the FOMC's 2 percent longer-run objective, the Committee expected that it would stabilize around that target over the medium term. At its most recent meeting, which concluded on January 31, the Committee kept the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged.11"

In terms of its spatial distribution, 25 of the 36 sub-divisions received normal or excess rainfall as against 28 sub-divisions last year. The total area sown under kharif crops was 6.6 per cent lower as on August 2 than a year ago. The live storage in major reservoirs on August 1 was at 33 per cent of the full reservoir level as compared with 45 per cent a year ago. Rainfall during the second half of the season (August-September) has been forecast to be normal by the India Meteorological Department (IMD).Industrial growth, measured by the index of industrial production (IIP), moderated in May 2019, pulled down by manufacturing and mining even as electricity generation picked up on strong demand. In terms of the use-based classification, the production of capital goods and consumer durables decelerated. However, consumer non-durables accelerated for the third consecutive month in May. The growth in the index of eight core industries decelerated in June, dragged down by a contraction in petroleum refinery products, crude oil, natural gas and cement. Capacity utilisation (CU) in the manufacturing sector, measured by the order books, inventory and capacity utilisation survey (OBICUS) of the Reserve Bank rose marginally to 76.1 per cent in Q4:2018-19 from 75.9 per cent in Q3; seasonally adjusted CU, however, fell to 74.5 per cent in Q4 from 75.6 per cent in Q3. The Reserve Bank¡¯s business assessment index (BAI) for Q1:2019-20 improved marginally, supported by a modest recovery in profit margins of the surveyed firms even as production and order books slowed. The manufacturing PMI rose to 52.5 in July from 52.1 in June, underpinned by a pick-up in production, higher new orders and optimism on demand conditions in the year ahead."
wildfires,"A pair of wind-driven wildlfires forced thousands of residents of Slave Lake, Alta., to evacuate their homes Sunday.
Residents of the town of 7,000 people were leaving via Highway 2 southeast to Athabasca.
The community's town hall has burned down, according to a local radio station, which said that it had lost its own building.
Slave Lake RCMP Staff Sgt. Mike Proctor said ""probably 30 per cent of the structures""  in the town had been destroyed by fire.
Alberta Sustainable Resources Minister Mel Knight said the evacuation of Slave Lake, which is about 200 kilometres north of Edmonton, was complicated by road closures.
Hundreds of firefighters are trying to save the town, Knight said. However, fire crews were hampered by heavy smoke and strong winds, which grounded water bombers Sunday.
Slave Lake's website said earlier in the day that the flames had breached the community's southern boundary.
""Please move toward large green areas, beaches or large parking lots like Walmart, Canadian Tire or the Sawridge Mall Parking Lot,"" the notice said.
""Do not attempt to leave on the highways if they are not open."""
Typhoon,"Typhoon Utor veered closer to Hong Kong and China's southern coastline on Wednesday after leaving a trail of destruction in the Philippines, where at least six people died.
The weather observatory in the international financial hub was poised to raise its No. 8 tropical cyclone signal early on Wednesday morning, its third highest alert level.
Heavy rain and winds of up to 122 km per hour (76 mph) were recorded in parts of Hong Kong, with a number of flights canceled at the city's international airport.
While financial markets, schools, businesses and non-essential government services close when any No. 8 or above signal is hoisted, the cyclone was not expected to hit Hong Kong directly, but to stray towards the western fringes of China's Guangdong province, nearer to Macau and the island of Hainan.
Should the No. 8 signal remain hoisted until 9 a.m. on Wednesday (0100 GMT), the Hong Kong stock exchange will remain closed for at least part of the day.
As of late Tuesday, more than 3,000 passengers were stranded at Sanya and Haikou airports on Hainan, according to China's official Xinhua news agency.
Some train and shipping services were also suspended, with waves of over 10 meters (32 feet) expected in some coastal zones.
Utor was the worst typhoon to hit the Philippines this year, displacing over 30,000 families as it caused landslides and floods and disrupted power and communications links."

wildfires,"Wildfires raging in the Amazon rainforest have hit a record number this year, with 72,843 fires detected so far by Brazil's space research center INPE, as concerns grow over right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro's environmental policy.
The surge marks an 83% increase over the same period of 2018, the agency said on Tuesday, and is the highest since records began in 2013. Since Thursday, INPE said satellite images spotted 9,507 new forest fires in the country, mostly in the Amazon basin, home to the world's largest tropical forest seen as vital to countering global warming.
Images show the northernmost state of Roraima covered in dark smoke. Amazonas declared an emergency in the south of the state and in its capital Manaus on Aug. 9. Acre, on the border with Peru, has been on environmental alert since Friday due to the fires.
Wildfires have increased in Mato Grosso and Para, two states where Brazil's agricultural frontier has pushed into the Amazon basin and spurred deforestation. Wildfires are common in the dry season, but are also deliberately set by farmers illegally deforesting land for cattle ranching.
The unprecedented surge in wildfires has occurred since Bolsonaro took office in January vowing to develop the Amazon region for farming and mining, ignoring international concern over increased deforestation.
Asked about the spread of uncontrolled fires, Bolsonaro brushed off criticism, saying it was the time of the year of the ""queimada"" or burn, when farmers use fire to clear land. ""I used to be called Captain Chainsaw. Now I am Nero, setting the Amazon aflame. But it is the season of the queimada,"" he told reporters.
Space agency INPE, however, said the large number of wildfires could not be attributed to the dry season or natural phenomena alone.
""There is nothing abnormal about the climate this year or the rainfall in the Amazon region, which is just a little below average,"" said INPE researcher Alberto Setzer.
People frequently blame the dry season for the wildfires in the Amazon, but that is not quite accurate, he said.
""The dry season creates the favorable conditions for the use and spread of fire, but starting a fire is the work of humans, either deliberately or by accident,"" Setzer said.
Bolsonaro recently fired the director of INPE after he criticized agency statistics showing an increase in deforestation in Brazil, saying they were inaccurate. ""I am waiting for the next set of numbers, that will not be made up numbers. If they are alarming, I will take notice of them in front of you,"" he told reporters."

Tremors were also felt across Pakistan including the capital, Islamabad, and northwestern Peshawar, and even as far as the eastern city of Lahore, which borders India.
The quake struck at the depth of 91.6 km and its epicentre was located 35 km west of Murghab town in Tajikistan.
The area of the epicentre is largely unpopulated mountain terrain.
There were no immediate reports of any loss of life or damage to property."
wildfires,"Firefighters in California were racing to slow the spread of wildfires that burned nearly one million acres in a week and destroyed hundreds of homes as weekend weather threatened to spark new fires and overwhelm the state's firefighting ability.
Responding to the emergency, President Donald Trump issued on Saturday a major disaster declaration to provide federal assistance. Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement that the declaration will also help people in counties affected by the fires with crisis counseling, housing and other social services.
Two clusters of wildfires in the San Francisco Bay Area broke old records to become the second- and third-largest wildfires in recent state history by size.
Light winds, cooler and more humid nighttime weather helped fire crews make a bit of progress, but their efforts could be hurt by warm, dry weather, erratic wind gusts and lightning in the forecast, state fire officials said.
The National Weather Service issued a red flag warning of high fire danger across the Bay Area and along the Central Coast, beginning from Sunday morning to Monday afternoon.
""The worst is not behind us. We are in a battle rhythm,"" California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Chief Thom Porter tweeted.
Since thousands of lightning strikes began on Aug. 15, the state responded to 585 wildfires that have burned nearly a million acres, or 1,562 square miles (4,046 square kilometers), according to CalFire.
Many were small and remote. The bulk of damage was from three clusters of fire ""complexes"" that were ravaging forest and rural areas in the San Francisco Bay Area and wine country north of San Francisco. They have burned 1,045 square miles (2,700 square kilometers).
The third one was burning in the Santa Cruz Mountains and along the coast of San Mateo County, south of San Francisco.
The fires have killed five people, torched nearly 700 homes and other structures and forced tens of thousands from their houses.
""Tuesday night when I went to bed I had a beautiful home on a beautiful ranch,"" said 81-year-old Hank Hanson of Vacaville. ""By Wednesday night I have nothing but a bunch of ashes."" Earlier in the week, fire officials in charge of each of the major wildfires said they were strapped for resources. Some firefighters were working 72-hour shifts instead of the usual 24 hours.
By Friday, the approximately 13,700 firefighters on the line began to get help on the ground and in the air from 10 states, along with the National Guard and US military."
drought,"India is facing one of its most serious droughts in recent memory – official estimates suggest that at least 330m people are likely to be affected by acute shortages of water. As the subcontinent awaits the imminent arrival of the monsoon rains, bringing relief to those who have suffered the long, dry and exceptionally warm summer, the crisis affecting India’s water resources is high on the public agenda.
Unprecedented drought demands unconventional responses, and there have been some fairly unusual attempts to address this year’s shortage. Perhaps most dramatic was the deployment of railway wagons to transport 500,000 litres of water per day across the Deccan plateau, with the train traversing more than 300km to provide relief to the district of Latur in Maharashtra state.
The need to shift water on this scale sheds light on the key issue that makes water planning in the Indian subcontinent so challenging. While the region gets considerable precipitation most years from the annual monsoon, the rain tends to fall in particular places – and for only a short period of time (about three months). This water needs to be stored, and made to last for the entire year.
In most years, it also means that there is often too much water in some places, resulting in as much distress due to flooding as there currently is due to drought. So there is a spatial challenge as well – water from the surplus regions needs to reach those with a shortfall, and the water train deployed in Maharashtra is one attempt to achieve this."
other,"One year ago the U.S. economy was robust with unemployment at historically low levels and real incomes rising. No one would have predicted that a year later the economy would come to a halt and more than 20 million people would be applying for unemployment benefits. This reversal was not due to monetary instability, which has been the primary cause of most recessions, but rather to a decision by government officials to mandate business closures to battle a pandemic. The initial sharp supply-side effect of COVID-19 quickly turned into a strong demand for cash and a corresponding decline in the velocity of money."
flood,"Japan’s Suga pledges immediate disaster assistance to Vietnam Japanese PM Yoshihide Suga promised Vietnam immediate natural disaster relief besides signing agreements on energy, defense and health cooperation during his visit to the nation Monday. Prime Minister Suga said Japan would provide Vietnam emergency assistance to cope with recent flooding in the central region, and continue to share experiences in natural disaster management at a news conference following a talk with Vietnamese PM Nguyen Xuan Phuc in Hanoi on Monday.  Suga and his wife arrived in Hanoi on Sunday night on a three-day official visit to Vietnam, his first overseas destination after taking office last month.  ""Japan decided to provide immediate assistance to Vietnam to minimize the damage caused by heavy rains in its central region. Japan is a country with a lot of experience in disaster prevention, so we will continue to share our knowledge and experience on disaster prevention with Vietnam,"" he said.  At least 93 people have died and around 53,000 families evacuated as of Monday due to flooding and landslides in central Vietnam."
other,"Global economic activity has come to a near standstill as COVID-19 related lockdowns and social distancing are imposed across a widening swathe of affected countries. Expectations of a shallow recovery in 2020 from 2019¡¯s decade low in global growth have been dashed. The outlook is now heavily contingent upon the intensity, spread and duration of the pandemic. There is a rising probability that large parts of the global economy will slip into recession.Financial markets have become highly volatile from January onwards due to the outbreak of COVID-19. Panic sell-offs have resulted in wealth destruction in equity markets across advanced and emerging economies alike. In the former, flight to safety has pulled down government bond yields to record lows with some hardening in recent days. In the latter, the rush to exit has rendered fixed income markets illiquid and resulted in firming up of yields. Emerging and advanced economy currencies are experiencing severe depreciation pressure on a daily basis because of fire sales due to extreme risk aversion. At this point, only the US dollar remains safe haven in a highly uncertain outlook. Japanese yen and gold _ the other two safe havens till the early part of March _ have given way to a flight to cash. International crude prices initially traded with a softening bias from January in anticipation of demand weakening due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Production cut disagreements among key oil producers, however, set off retaliatory supply scale-ups and a price war that plunged international Brent crude prices to a low of US$ 25 per barrel on March 18, 2020. These developments are likely to dampen inflation across advanced and emerging economies. Central banks and governments are in war mode, responding to the situation with several conventional and unconventional measures targeted at easing financial conditions to avoid a demand collapse and to prevent financial markets from freezing up due to illiquidity."
other,"Labor market conditions clearly continued to strengthen during the early months of this year: Payrolls expanded at a solid pace of almost 200,000 per month in the first quarter, and while the unemployment rate flattened out at close to 5 percent, the labor force participation rate moved up strongly. More recently, the signals regarding labor market improvement have become more mixed: Payroll gains are reported to have slowed to an average of 80,000 per month in April and May (or about 100,000 after adjustment for the effects of a strike). The unemployment rate dropped in May to 4.7 percent, its lowest level since late 2007; however, the labor force participation rate fell back again and was little changed from its year-ago level. All told, the latest readings suggest that labor markets are tighter than they were at the end of last year but that the pace of improvement has slowed. Whether those signs of slowing will be confirmed by subsequent data, and how persistent any such slowing will be, remains to be seen."
other,"Sharp swings in global crude prices over the past six months impart uncertainty to the outlook. The baseline scenario assumes crude oil prices (Indian basket) at US$ 80 per barrel in the second half of 2018-19. Upside risks to the baseline assumption can emanate from geo-political developments and supply disruptions. For a net energy importer like India, the dynamics of international crude price movements have significant macroeconomic implications. Box I.1 presents a scenario in which the Indian basket price increases by 10 per cent to US$ 88 per barrel, which is plausible under the current global crude oil price volatility. Under this scenario, inflation could increase by 20 bps and real GDP growth could be lower by around 15 bps in relation to their respective baselines given in Sections I.2 and I.3 (Charts I.11a and I.12a). Assuming that the Indian basket crude oil price increases by 20 per cent to US$ 96 a barrel, inflation and GDP growth could turn out to be 40 bps above and 30 bps below their respective baselines. Conversely, crude oil prices could soften below the baseline assumption if, for instance, there is a larger than expected shale gas supply and weaker than expected global demand due to growth slowing down on account of protectionist measures. As a result, if the price of the Indian basket of crude falls by 10 per cent to US$ 72 per barrel, inflation could ease by around 20 bps with a boost of 15 bps to growth.In the baseline scenario, global growth is expected to be stronger in 2018 and 2019 relative to 2017. While the pace of global growth has been maintained in Q2:2018, it has turned uneven with new risks clouding the outlook. Escalating protectionism and rising geopolitical tensions could weigh on external demand. Tightening of financial conditions on the back of US monetary policy normalisation and expansionary US fiscal policy and uncertainty about the pace of further normalisation could also dampen global demand. If global growth slips by 50 bps, domestic growth and inflation could be around 20 bps and 10 bps below their respective baseline trajectories. However, if inflation remains benign in major advanced economies, a more gradual pace of monetary policy normalisation in these economies could boost global demand and global commodity prices. In this scenario, assuming that global growth surprises by 25 bps on the upside, domestic growth and inflation could edge higher by around 10 bps and 5 bps, respectively (Charts I.11a and I.12aFollowing the increase in pay and allowances by the central government for its employees based on the recommendations of the 7th central pay commission (CPC), some state governments have revised pay and allowances for their employees. If all state governments implement the increase in pay and allowances _ especially HRAs _ of an order similar to that of the central government, and if these get reflected in CPI, headline inflation could be around 100 bps above the baseline on account of the direct statistical effect on house rents (Chart I.11b). Additional indirect effects could also arise from higher demand and inflation expectations. As noted by the MPC in its recent resolutions, the direct statistical impact of HRA revisions will be looked through for policy purposes, while being watchful for any second-round effects."
other,"A monetary policy that lowers interest rates and stimulates borrowing is known as an expansionary monetary policy or loose monetary policy. Conversely, a monetary policy that raises interest rates and reduces borrowing in the economy is a contractionary monetary policy or tight monetary policy. This module will discuss how expansionary and contractionary monetary policies affect interest rates and aggregate demand, and how such policies will affect macroeconomic goals like unemployment and inflation. We will conclude with a look at the Fed¡¯s monetary policy practice in recent decades.Consider the market for loanable bank funds, shown in Figure 1. The original equilibrium (E0) occurs at an interest rate of 8% and a quantity of funds loaned and borrowed of $10 billion. An expansionary monetary policy will shift the supply of loanable funds to the right from the original supply curve (S0) to S1, leading to an equilibrium (E1) with a lower interest rate of 6% and a quantity of funds loaned of $14 billion. Conversely, a contractionary monetary policy will shift the supply of loanable funds to the left from the original supply curve (S0) to S2, leading to an equilibrium (E2) with a higher interest rate of 10% and a quantity of funds loaned of $8 billion."

GDP growth is expected to be around 3 per cent over this year and 2_ per cent over 2020.With growth expected to be a little above trend and the unemployment rate continuing to decline, underlying inflation is expected to increase gradually, reaching 2_ per cent by the end of 2020. Lower petrol prices are expected to result in headline inflation falling to about 1_ per cent in early 2019 before rebounding to be similar to underlying inflation. Forecasts for underlying inflation have been revised slightly lower, reflecting somewhat lower growth and expected near-term weakness in administered and utilities price inflation."

The La Soufrière volcano first erupted on Friday, blanketing the island in a layer of ash and forcing more than 16,000 people to evacuate their homes. Smaller explosions continued over the weekend, causing power cuts and disrupting water supplies. Emergency officials have described the landscape as a ""battle zone"". ""The volcano continues to erupt explosively with the production of copious amounts of ash,"" the University of the West Indies' Seismic Research Center said.

Typhoon,"Severe flood warnings remain in force across parts of northern England after heavy rain from Storm Cristoph caused rivers to burst their banks and forced the evacuation of dozens of care home residents.
Environment Secretary George Eustice chaired a Cobra meeting on Thursday in response to the flooding and warned that more could be on the way next week.
Around 40 residents were assisted out of the Weaver Court care home in Northwich, Cheshire, by fire crews with dinghies on Thursday afternoon, as most of the town centre lay under water.
Earlier, Cheshire Fire and Rescue said it was in the process of rescuing 21 people by boat from Lea Court nursing home in Warrington.
Residents were also evacuated overnight in the Didsbury and Northenden areas of Greater Manchester, and Superintendent Julie Westgate, from Cheshire Constabulary, said a number of people had been evacuated in Warrington, Northwich, Chester, Ellesmere Port and Tattenhall.
 total of 167 flood warnings were in place across parts of Wales, the Midlands and the north of England.
One woman said she “watched the water coming through the back door” of her house in Lymm, Cheshire in the early hours of Thursday.

wildfires,"Australia is currently engulfed with smoke. The wildfires that the country is experiencing at the moment are a result of man-induced global warming.
There have been quite a few human casualties and the bushfires have burned nearly 5 million hectares of land. Australia saw the hottest and driest season this year with the temperature reaching almost 50 degrees celsius in the last month.
The bushfires are also having an extreme effect on the wildlife of Australia. According to reports over 8,000 koalas, which is approximately 30 per cent of the total population in NSW's mid-North Coast region have been lost to fire.
Ecologists from the University of Sydney believe, over 480 million birds, animals and reptiles have already been lost because of the fires.
Netizens have also taken to the internet to share images and videos of the bushfires to show the world what exactly is happening in Australia and it is a heart-breaking sight."
other,"Supply chain disruptions on account of COVID-19 persist, with implications for both food and non-food prices. A more favourable food inflation outlook may emerge as the bumper rabi harvest eases prices of cereals, especially if open market sales and public distribution offtake are expanded on the back of significantly higher procurement. The relatively moderate increases in minimum support prices (MSP) for the kharif crops and monsoon are also supportive of benign inflation prospects. Nonetheless, upside risks to food prices remain. The abatement of price pressure in key vegetables is delayed and remains contingent upon normalisation of supplies. Protein based food items could also emerge as a pressure point, given the tight demand-supply balance in the case of pulses. The inflation outlook of non-food categories is, however, fraught with uncertainty. Higher domestic taxes on petroleum products have resulted in elevated domestic pump prices and will impart broad-based cost-push pressures going forward. Volatility in financial markets and rising asset prices also pose upside risks to the outlook. Taking into consideration all these factors, headline inflation may remain elevated in Q2:2020-21, but may moderate in H2:2020-21 aided by large favourable base effects.Turning to the growth outlook, the recovery in the rural economy is expected to be robust, buoyed by the progress in kharif sowing. Manufacturing firms responding to the Reserve Bank¡¯s industrial outlook survey expect domestic demand to recover gradually from Q2 and to sustain through Q1:2021-22. On the other hand, consumer confidence turned more pessimistic in July relative to the preceding round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s survey. External demand is expected to remain anaemic under the weight of the global recession and contraction in global trade. Taking into consideration the above factors, real GDP growth in Q2-Q4 is expected to evolve along the lines noted in the May resolution. For the year 2020-21, as a whole, real GDP growth is expected to be negative. An early containment of the COVID-19 pandemic may impart an upside to the outlook. A more protracted spread of the pandemic, deviations from the forecast of a normal monsoon and global financial market volatility are the key downside risks.The June release of headline inflation after a gap of two months and imputed prints of the CPI for April-May have added uncertainty to the inflation outlook. The NSO has adopted best practices in producing these imputations for the purpose of business continuity in the face of challenges to data collection due to the nation-wide lockdown. The NSO has, however, not provided inflation rates for April and May. For the purpose of monetary formulation and conduct, therefore, the MPC is of the view that CPI prints for April and May can be regarded as a break in the CPI series.The MPC noted that the economy is experiencing unprecedented stress in an austere global environment. Extreme uncertainty characterises the outlook, which is heavily contingent upon the intensity, spread and duration of the pandemic _ particularly the heightened risks associated with a second wave of infections _ and the discovery of the vaccine. In these conditions, supporting the recovery of the economy assumes primacy in the conduct of monetary policy. In pursuit of this objective, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative as long as it is necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy. While space for further monetary policy action in support of this stance is available, it is important to use it judiciously and opportunistically to maximise the beneficial effects for underlying economic activity.At the same time, the MPC is conscious that its primary mandate is to achieve the medium-term target for CPI inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent. It also recognises that the headline CPI prints of April-May, 2020 require more clarity. At the current juncture, the inflation objective itself is further obscured by (a) the spike in food prices because of floods in eastern India and ongoing lockdown related disruptions; and (b) cost-push pressures in the form of high taxes on petroleum products, hikes in telecom charges, rising raw material costs reflected in upward revisions in steel prices and rise in gold prices on safe haven demand. Given the uncertainty surrounding the inflation outlook and taking into consideration the extremely weak state of the economy in the midst of an unprecedented shock from the ongoing pandemic, it is prudent to pause and remain watchful of incoming data as to how the outlook unravels.Meanwhile, the cumulative reduction of 250 basis points since February 2019 is working its way through the economy, lowering interest rates in money, bond and credit markets, and narrowing down spreads. Financing conditions have eased considerably, enabling financial flows via financial markets, especially at a time when banks remain highly risk averse. Accordingly, the MPC decides to stay on hold with regard to the policy rate and remain watchful for a durable reduction in inflation to use the available space to support the revival of the economy.All members of the MPC _ Dr. Chetan Ghate, Dr. Pami Dua, Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das _ unanimously voted for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged and continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward."
earthquake,"Magnitude 6.9 Quake Hits Northeastern Japan, Shakes Tokyo A magnitude 6.9 quake hit off the coast of northeastern Japan, briefly triggering a tsunami advisory for Miyagi prefecture and causing shaking in Tokyo. Initial damage reported from the earthquake that occurred Saturday evening were minor compared to the magnitude 7.3 quake that struck about a month ago further south on Japan’s Pacific coast. About 200 buildings in Miyagi prefecture were left without power, Tohoku Electric Power Co. said, while broadcaster NHK said some bullet train services in the region were suspended. No abnormalities were reported at Fukushima’s Dai-ichi and Dai-ni nuclear plants, according to Tokyo Electric Power Co. Tohoku Electric Power said no irregularities were reported at its Onagawa nuclear plant."
drought,"The United Nations’ food agency issued an alert on Tuesday warning that a severe drought was threatening the wheat crop in China, the world’s largest wheat producer, and resulting in shortages of drinking water for people and livestock.
China has been essentially self-sufficient in grain for decades, for national security reasons. Any move by China to import large quantities of food in response to the drought could drive international prices even higher than the record levels recently reached.
“China’s grain situation is critical to the rest of the world ? if they are forced to go out on the market to procure adequate supplies for their population, it could send huge shock waves through the world’s grain markets,” said Robert S. Zeigler, the director general of the International Rice Research Institute in Los Ba?os, in the Philippines.
The state-run news media in China warned Monday that the country’s major agricultural regions were facing their worst drought in 60 years. On Tuesday the state news agency Xinhua said that Shandong Province, a cornerstone of Chinese grain production, was bracing for its worst drought in 200 years unless substantial precipitation came by the end of this month.
World wheat prices are already surging, and they have been widely cited as one reason for protests in Egypt and elsewhere in the Arab world. A separate United Nations report last week said global food export prices had reached record levels in January. The impact of China’s drought on global food prices and supplies could create serious problems for less affluent countries that rely on imported food.
With 2.85 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, nearly three times that of Japan, the country with the second-largest reserves, China has ample buying power to prevent any serious food shortages."
other,"As indicated in the Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies of October 4, 2017, a High Level Task Force on Public Credit Registry (PCR) for India (Chairman: Shri Yeshwant M. Deosthalee) was constituted by the Reserve Bank to review the current availability of information on credit, the adequacy of existing information utilities, and identify gaps that could be filled by a PCR. The Task Force, which submitted its report on April 4, 2018, recommended that with a view to address information asymmetry, foster access to credit, and strengthen the credit culture in the economy, a PCR should be set up by the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank has considered the recommendations of the Task Force and decided to set up a PCR in a modular and phased manner. The report of the Task Force will be released for public on the Reserve Bank¡¯s website today. An Implementation Task Force (ITF) is being constituted by the Reserve Bank to help design undertake logistics for the next steps in setting up of the PCR.Pursuant to the announcement made in the first bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement 2018-19 on April 5, 2018, a system for daily reporting of individual transactions under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) by Authorised Dealer (AD) banks has been put in place. This system enables the AD banks to view the remittances already sent by an individual during the financial year, thus improving monitoring and ensuring compliance with the LRS limits. Since the said reporting system uses the Permanent Account Number (PAN) of the remitter as a Unique Identifier to aggregate the remitter-wise data, it has been decided that furnishing of PAN, which hitherto was not to be insisted upon while putting through permissible current account transactions of upto USD 25,000, shall now be mandatory for making all remittances under LRS. Further, in the context of remittances allowed under LRS for maintenance of close relatives, it has been decided to align the definition of ¡®relative¡¯ with the definition given in Companies Act, 2013 instead of Companies Act, 1956."
earthquake,"Major quake shakes southern Mexico, at least six killed LA CRUCECITA, MEXICO (REUTERS) _ A powerful earthquake of magnitude 7.4 struck southern Mexico’s Pacific coast on Tuesday (June 24), killing at least six people and cutting off isolated villages, as well as causing damage to buildings hundreds of kilometres away in Mexico City.  The fatalities were near the quake’s centre in Oaxaca, a mountainous state known for its coffee, mescal and Spanish colonial architecture.  A Reuters witness in the tourist town of La Crucecita, which Mexican authorities said was the epicentre of the earthquake, saw anxious residents standing outside their homes on the streets many hours after the tremor as they feared deadly aftershocks.  Many houses were scarred by huge cracks across walls and residents sought to clear debris from the streets, the Reuters witness added. About 200 houses in the area were damaged, including 30 that were badly impacted, a local official said.  “We lost everything in one moment to nature,” said Vicente Romero, an owner of a stationery store whose house suffered vast structural damage. “This is our life’s work.” Rockfalls blocked the winding mountain roads between the state capital of Oaxaca city and the coast. Rescue workers have not reached all villages reported to have suffered damage, raising fears that more people may be injured or killed."
other,"Small business owners often deal with banks on a regular basis, and while you may not be familiar with monetary policy, you've probably noticed that at certain times your interest rates go up or down and your taxes increase or decrease. You might also notice that you have access to more or less credit at certain times, even though your business' credit standing has remained stable. Your ability to employ new people changes with these factors as well as your ability to offer new products.These changes in your experience of business are due to monetary policies decided upon by the Federal Reserve of the United States. In order to release more money into the economy or reign it in, they write up policies and put them into action. Some monetary policy examples include buying or selling government securities through open market operations, changing the discount rate offered to member banks or altering the reserve requirement of how much money banks must have on hand that's not already spoken for through loans."
flood,"No time to brood: central Vietnam rolls up its sleeves As floodwaters recede, central Vietnam residents have no time to lose as they clean up, repair and salvage what’s left of their belongings. Cam Due Commune in Cam Xuyen District, Ha Tinh is one of six communes in the central province that suffered heavy damage in the recent flooding, with over 2,000 families affected. Many houses along an inter-communal road were severely damaged. As of Saturday, at least 130 had lost their lives to floods and landslides in the central region and 18 others were still missing, according to the nation's disaster management authorities. Worse still, central Vietnam provinces from Nghe An to ThuaThien-Hue have been warned to expect heavy rainfall of up to 200 mm from Sunday until Monday because of storm Saudel"

The temblor, which occurred at 7:34 p.m. local time, was centered at 44.7 degrees north latitude and 148.9 degrees east longitude with a depth of 160 km. The quake logged 4 in some parts of Hokkaido Prefecture on the Japanese seismic intensity scale which peaks at 7. So far no tsunami warning has been issued."
Typhoon,"Tropical Storm Cristobal brings heavy rain and flooding to southern US Tropical Storm Cristobal made landfall on Louisiana’s coastline on Sunday 7 June, but the impacts of the storm were felt far and wide. Rainfall rates of 152.4mm an hour were recorded in Florida resulting in flash flooding destroying cars, as well as a tornado forming in downtown Orlando. Prior to landfall on US soil, Cristobal brought destruction along the Gulf of Mexico, with nearly 328.9mm of rain falling in a 24-hour period causing significant flooding, cutting off communities, and triggering landslides. Cristobal is the third named storm of an already busy Atlantic hurricane season. The start of the monsoon season was officially announced last week in Kerala, India, where favourable conditions for the south-west monsoon have developed. The monsoon season is critical for the agricultural sector, which accounts for approximately 15% India’s economy, playing a vital role in crop irrigation. However, heavy monsoon rains can be hazardous too, bringing the threat of landslides and flash flooding, frequently resulting in the loss of life. In the central Netherlands, three waterspouts developed over Markermeer Lake, near Lelystad, on Friday. These waterspouts formed as a series of heavy showers passed over the region from the east, these showers later developing into a thunderstorm."
earthquake,"Tsunami warning lifted after magnitude 6.9 earthquake hits Japan Japan's meteorological agency lifted a tsunami advisory around an hour after a 6.9-magnitude earthquake struck off the country's northeastern coast on Saturday, causing no immediate damage or injuries. The strong quake, which was originally estimated as 7.2 magnitude, hit at 6.09pm in Pacific waters off the Miyagi region with a depth of about 60 kilometres, the JMA said, issuing an advisory for tsunami waves of around one metre. Thousands of households received evacuation warnings over the tsunami alert, which was lifted at around 7.30pm , prompting municipalities to also end the evacuation measures."
other,"In the Collateralised Borrowing and Lending Obligation (CBLO) segment, which constitutes more than 60 per cent of the overnight market, banks are usually on the borrowing side, while mutual funds (MFs) are the major lenders. The share of MFs in CBLO lending, which had gone up to as much as 80 per cent in March 2017 in the wake of demonetisation, has gradually subsided during the year to more normal levels, averaging around 60-70 per cent up to March 2018. Intra-day trading is largely concentrated in the first hour in alignment with the call money segment and spikes around 1-2.30 pm due to stepped-up activity by associate members: market participants such as mutual funds and insurance companies who do not have current accounts with the Reserve Bank and are not allowed into the market beyond 2.30 pm (in order to provide for adequate time for settlement of fund obligations for these members who settle at designated settlement banks) (Chart IV.5). Trading volumes and rates fall sharply in the CBLO segment on reporting Fridays to escape the application of the cash reserve ratio (CRR)1.The collateralised market repo segment accounts for 30 per cent of the overall overnight market turnover. Typically, the turnover in the market repo segment comprises ¡®basket repos¡¯, in which foreign banks are the major lenders as they prefer market repo for lending because of its collateralised nature, and ¡®specials¡¯ that are used by market participants for acquiring specific securities to deliver against their outstanding short positions. In the second half of 2017-18, the shares of basket repo and special repo turnover in the market repo segment¡¯s turnover were 55 per cent and 45 per cent, respectively, as against 57 per cent and 43 per cent in the first half. Interest rates in the collateralised segments, i.e., CBLO and market repo, evolved with a soft bias relative to the WACR and, in fact, traded 10 basis points and 2 basis points, respectively, below the WACR on average through the second half of 2017-18.Barring term premia, interest rates on certificates of deposits (CDs), commercial paper (CPs) and 91-day Treasury bills (T-Bills) generally evolve in alignment with the WACR (Chart IV.6). From mid- December, however, they have diverged on higher interest rates for lending beyond March-end on the consideration of year-end demand for funds for balance sheet management purposes _ a usual seasonal phenomenon _ though this divergence was initially triggered by the announcement of additional market borrowing by the government. In recent years, CPs have been increasingly resorted to as credit substitutes for working capital requirements as CP rates continue to rule significantly lower than bank lending rates. Consequently, issuances of CPs picked up to _11,448 billion in the second half of 2017-18 as against _9,125 billion a year ago. As surplus liquidity shrank, fresh issuances of CDs also went up to _2,181 billion from just _1,017 billion in the second half of 2016-17."
other,"The Reserve Bank aims to meet the second objective by modulating net foreign assets (NFA) and net domestic assets (NDA) growth over the course of the year, broadly consistent with the demand for liquid assets to meet transaction needs of the economy. This will ensure adequate availability of durable liquidity, regardless of short term seasonal and frictional fluctuations. The Reserve Bank tries to smooth this growth over the year. So, for example, in periods when the Reserve Bank purchases significant quantities of NFA, the growth of NDA may have to be commensurately lower and may even have to be negative through the open market sale of domestic bonds.Experience suggests that the provision of short term liquidity does not substitute fully for needed durable liquidity, though durable liquidity can substitute for short term liquidity needs. Going forward, the Reserve Bank intends to first meet requirements of durable liquidity, and then use its fine-tuning operations to make short term liquidity conditions consistent with the intended policy stance. This may result in seemingly anomalous situations in which the Reserve Bank injects durable liquidity even when it is using short term instruments to withdraw excess short term liquidity, but such actions will be consistent with our dual objectives of liquidity management.Finally, given that new instruments such as variable rate reverse repo auctions allow the Reserve Bank to suck out excess short term liquidity from the system without the excess liquidity being deposited with the Reserve Bank through overnight fixed rate reverse repo, it is possible for the Reserve Bank to keep the system closer to balance on average without the operational rate falling significantly. Thus, the past rationale for keeping the system in significant average liquidity deficit no longer is as compelling, especially when the policy stance is intended to be accommodative. Moreover, given that the Reserve Bank¡¯s market operations rather than depositing or borrowing at standing facilities determine the operational interest rate, the policy rate corridor can be narrowed, as suggested by the Expert Committee."
Typhoon,"Four people were killed while 67 — including 53 fishermen and nine mountaineers — remained missing as Typhoon Utor left for the South China Sea after a deadly 24-hour landfall in Luzon on Monday.
Reynaldo de la Cruz, 53, drowned in Nueva Vizcaya, northern Luzon on Tuesday, a day after Typhoon Utor entered Aurora Province causing floods, landslides and toppling trees and power lines, said Undersecretary Eduardo del Rosario, head of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC).
Del Rosario added that Joemar Salicong, 22, died in a landslide in Tuba, Benguet, also in northern Luzon on Monday.
Earlier on Saturday Dolores Montero, 68 and her granddaughter Erica Montero Sim, 8, drowned when their motorboat was destroyed off Buenavista coastal village in Cagnion, Surigao, central Philippines, another affected area, said del Rosario.
He said the two victims were identified by NDRRMC’s provincial office.
Meanwhile, a ground report from northern Luzon said that Benny Labio, 40, died when his house was swallowed by the Cagayan River in Maand village, San Agustin town, meaning the number of fatalities could reach five.
“We hope this is the final list of casualties,” del Rosario said, adding the number could change dramatically in the storm’s aftermath.
Some 35 fishermen from the western Pangasinan towns of Infanta and Bolinao were reported missing after they failed to return home from sailing on August 5 and 8, said del Rosario, adding that five of the fishermen were not yet identified.
Some 23 fishermen from Camarines Norte and Catanduanes in Bicol, southern Luzon, remained missing after they set sail last week, before Typhoon Utor was seen in the Pacific Ocean, said del Rosario, adding they were part of a group of 75 fishermen who sailed to the sea, 52 of whom managed to return safely on Sunday.
Meanwhile, nine mountaineers were reported missing after they failed to return from Mount Tarak in Alas-asin village, in Bataan on Saturday, Bataan Governor Albert Garcia said, adding that Typhoon Utor might be responsible for their disappearance. Their names were not released.
Some 30 kilometres of road was flooded in Dilasalag, Aurora, the hardest hit province in northeastern Luzon, where three towns, Casiguran, Dilasag, and Dinalungan were declared in a state of calamity, said del Rosario.
Ninety per cent of crops were damaged in Dilasalag due to floods, confirmed Mayor Victorio Briones.
Almost all roads were impassable due to floods and landslides in many towns of Aurora, said Aurora Governor Gerardo Noveras, adding that power came back 24 hours after rains and winds toppled electric poles in these towns.
Seventy three houses were damaged while five were destroyed in Aurora, said Noveras, adding the typhoon’s wrath is still being assessed in Aurora’s tow other towns such as Dingalan and Dipaculao.
People stranded on riverbanks were evacuated in coastal towns of Nueva Vizcaya, another hard hit area in northern Luzon, TV footage showed.
In other submerged areas, rising rivers swept animals, crops, and houses, the same report said.
Floods isolated several towns in Isabela province although it was not directly hit by the typhoon, said Isabela Gov. Faustino Dy III.
People rejoiced when nine passengers and a driver emerged alive from a vehicle that was buried by a landslide in Itogon town, northern Luzon on Tuesday morning, said Chief Inspector Fernando Botangen of the Itogon police.
A four-metre high flood occurred in Baguio City’s Camp Lagoon. The northern Luzon summer capital also suffered power outage, telecommunications failure, and road closures due to rockfalls.
The typhoon dumped most of its 24-hour rain in northern Luzon’s Baguio City; central Luzon’s Dagupan and Cabanatuan cities and Iba town, Zambales, said the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa), a government run weather station.
Typhoon Utor left the Philippines early on Tuesday morning, Pagasa confirmed.
A total of 20 storms enter the Philippines every year."
wildfires,"A wildfire burning in southern Spain's Andalucia region has forced some 200 people to evacuate their homes.
The fire broke out near the towns of Mijas and Ojen, close to the popular tourist resort of Marbella.
Scores of firefighters have been tackling the flames while aircraft have been dumping water and spraying homes to keep them cool.
Officials said the blaze was largely under control by Monday evening and residents were allowed to return home.
""The fire broke out [on Sunday] in high temperatures, winds of more than 20km/h (12mph), and a breakout zone made up of thicket and pine groves,"" the Andalucian fire department said in a statement.
Four houses were burned but there were no reported injuries, local government officials told the BBC."
drought,"Drought conditions are returning to California as major rain and significant mountain snow had not fallen since December 2019. Sacramento and San Francisco have not seen a drop of rain in February 2020, which is usually one of the wettest months of the year for the state. State water authorities said despite the dry conditions, reservoirs are either at or above averages due to a wet 2019.
Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles' (UCLA) Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, noted that this has not happened in 150 years or more.
""There have even been a couple of wildfires-- which is definitely not something you typically hear about in the middle of winter.""
Temperatures were warmer than average, and there is also no moisture in the forecast. ""The dryness has picked up as the season has gone on,"" Swain said.
The National Weather Service (NWS) also shared satellite photos showing the difference of snowpack on mountains between February 2019 and 2020.
""What a difference a year makes,"" NWS wrote, adding that so far, the snowpack is 58 percent below usual this time of the year.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, less than half of normal precipitation has fallen from Nevada's central and southern regions westward across much of California since mid-December.
Just over 9.5 percent of the state, including the central and southern Sierra Nevada as well as the adjacent areas of the Central Valley, was designated being in moderate drought last week.
An abnormally-dry status has also been applied to Central Valley and a portion from the San Francisco Bay Area to the Sierra, and parts of the California-Oregon border.
On Wednesday, February 19, NWS Weather Prediction Center said dry weather conditions will continue across much of western U.S. through the end of the week.
Furthermore, forecasters said if the dry pattern persists through the month of February, many areas will be nearing the driest combined January and February on record."
other,"Retail inflation measured by the consumer price index (CPI) rose for the fifth month in December across all constituent categories. While the upturn in December essentially reflected unfavourable base effects, the ongoing seasonal decline in prices of fruits and vegetables could temper headline inflation in the near-term. Prices of cereals recorded modest increases despite the adverse monsoon, indicative of effective supply management. On the other hand, pulses inflation continued to remain elevated, reflecting structural mismatches.CPI inflation excluding food and fuel rose for the fourth successive month. Excluding petrol and diesel from this category, inflation remained flat. A breakdown into goods and services categories shows that while goods inflation declined, services inflation has been sticky since September 2015 across housing, transport and communication, medical and other services. Household inflation expectations remain elevated and the rate of increase in corporate staff costs picked up. On the other hand, rural wage growth has been muted."
Typhoon,"With one of the largest storms seen for years bearing down upon the Korean Peninsula, both Koreas have today warned of the potential for danger.
Chosun Central News Agency reported on the approach of ‘Typhoon Bolaven’ this afternoon, saying, “Typhoon-15 is now moving northwestward at a velocity of 12km/h, as of 09:00 Thursday.”
“It is expected to come to the sea off Shanghai, China on around August 27th and move northward along the west coastal area of Korea before reaching the Chinese northeastern region on the evening of August 28th. The typhoon-15 will trigger strong wind and heavy rains in overall areas of Korea on August 27th and 28th,” the brief report added.
According to South Korea’s meteorological authorities, meanwhile, Typhoon Bolaven was 460km south of Sogwipo, the largest city on the south coast of Jeju Island, at 12PM today, moving at 34km/h in a north-northwesterly direction. It appears set to make landfall over Hwanghae Province in North Korea late on the afternoon of the 28th.
With that particular region only just recovering from serious flooding, the typhoon is likely to be an unwelcome, and damaging, addition to what has been a difficult summer."
Typhoon,"A typhoon that officials said was the most powerful to hit Vietnam in 20 years blew away from the country on Thursday after setting off landslides, sinking boats and knocking out power to at least 1.7 million people. At least 35 people were killed and more than 50 were missing, state media said.
The immediate focus for rescuers was on three villages in the country’s central region where landslides killed at least 19 people and are suspected of burying more than 40 others in thick mud and debris.
Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung traveled to the site of one landslide where soldiers were working to clear debris with bulldozers and he ordered officers to urgently send more troops to help with the efforts."
Typhoon,"Tropical Storm Bertha makes landfall on South Carolina coast, could bring up to 8 inches of rain to some areas Bertha is the second named storm of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season. The main impact from Bertha will be heavy rain in the Carolinas and Virginia. Bertha is the same system that drenched Florida over the Memorial Day weekend. Tropical Storm Bertha made landfall on South Carolina’s coast Wednesday morning shortly after it formed, forecasters said. Bertha is the second named storm of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, which doesn't officially begin until June 1. A tropical storm warning was in place for much of the South Carolina coast. The main impact from Bertha will be heavy rain, the National Hurricane Center said, primarily in portions of South and North Carolina and Virginia. Up to 8 inches of rain is possible in some areas, AccuWeather said. ""This rainfall may produce life-threatening flash flooding,"" the hurricane center said. Bertha’s maximum sustained winds were near 50 mph, but it was expected to weaken to a tropical depression after moving inland. Along America Street in Charleston, residents awoke Wednesday to an intersection that had become a water-filled canal. Cars parked on the curb had water up to their doors, The Post and Courier reported. The storm was centered about 20 miles east of Charleston, South Carolina, and was moving northwest near 9 mph. Bertha is the same system that drenched Florida over the Memorial Day weekend, bringing record rainfall to several South Florida communities. Miami recorded 7.43 inches of rain over the holiday weekend. West Palm Beach shattered its daily rainfall record Monday when 4.44 inches poured down. Fort Lauderdale recorded record rainfall May 25: a total of 4.03 inches. Bertha follows on the heels of Tropical Storm Arthur, which brushed the North Carolina coast last week. This is the first time since 2012 that two named storms have formed in the month of May, according to Houston-based meteorologist Matt Lanza."
other,"Since the February bi-monthly monetary policy statement, inflation has been quiescent. Headline CPI inflation is set to undershoot the target of 5.0 per cent for Q4 of 2016-17 in view of the sub-4 per cent readings for January and February. For 2017-18, inflation is projected to average 4.5 per cent in the first half of the year and 5 per cent in the second half (Chart 1).Risks are evenly balanced around the inflation trajectory at the current juncture. There are upside risks to the baseline projection. The main one stems from the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the south west monsoon in view of the rising probability of an El Ni_o event around July-August, and its implications for food inflation. Proactive supply management will play a critical role in staving off pressures on headline inflation. A prominent risk could emanate from managing the implementation of the allowances recommended by the 7th CPC. In case the increase in house rent allowance as recommended by the 7th CPC is awarded, it will push up the baseline trajectory by an estimated 100-150 basis points over a period of 12-18 months, with this initial statistical impact on the CPI followed up by second-order effects. Another upside risk arises from the one-off effects of the GST. The general government deficit, which is high by international comparison, poses yet another risk for the path of inflation, which is likely to be exacerbated by farm loan waivers. Recent global developments entail a reflation risk which may lift commodity prices further and pass through into domestic inflation. Moreover, geopolitical risks may induce global financial market volatility with attendant spillovers. On the downside, international crude prices have been easing recently and their pass-through to domestic prices of petroleum products should alleviate pressure on headline inflation. Also, stepped-up procurement operations in the wake of the record production of foodgrains will rebuild buffer stocks and mitigate food price stress, if it materialises."

drought,"Brown is the color of summer in northern Europe this year.
Fields that are usually covered in lush green grass have now turned to dust, trees are shedding their leaves and animals eating dry hay or grain instead of grazing in pastures.
Farmers in around a dozen countries — from Ireland to the Baltics — are grappling with a once-in-a-generation drought. The unrelenting heat wave has devastated crops, with more than half of the harvest expected to be lost in some areas.
“I have never seen this type of hot and dry weather, and I’ve been farming over 30 years,” Max Schulman told NBC News from his farm about 35 miles outside of Helsinki, where he grows beans, oats, wheat and oilseeds.
Schulman says his farm has received just 3 inches of rain since the end of April, compared with 10 to 14 inches most years.
In many areas, the scale of the damage is not yet known as harvests have not been completed.
The drought has hit Denmark particularly hard, with the spring harvest of grains and vegetables down 40 to 50 percent, according to Troels Toft, an official with the Danish Agriculture and Food Council. He estimates that the losses will cost the country's farming industry around $944 million."
other,"I will now turn to monetary policy. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is committed to policies that promote maximum employment and price stability, consistent with our mandate from the Congress. As my description of economic developments indicated, our economy has made important progress toward the objective of maximum employment, reflecting in part support from the highly accommodative stance of monetary policy in recent years. In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the substantial improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions--the stated objective of the Committee's recent asset purchase program--the FOMC concluded that program at the end of October.Even so, the Committee judges that a high degree of policy accommodation remains appropriate to foster further improvement in labor market conditions and to promote a return of inflation toward 2 percent over the medium term. Accordingly, the FOMC has continued to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and to keep the Federal Reserve's holdings of longer-term securities at their current elevated level to help maintain accommodative financial conditions. The FOMC is also providing forward guidance that offers information about our policy outlook and expectations for the future path of the federal funds rate. In that regard, the Committee judged, in December and January, that it can be patient in beginning to raise the federal funds rate. This judgment reflects the fact that inflation continues to run well below the Committee's 2 percent objective, and that room for sustainable improvements in labor market conditions still remains.The FOMC's assessment that it can be patient in beginning to normalize policy means that the Committee considers it unlikely that economic conditions will warrant an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate for at least the next couple of FOMC meetings. If economic conditions continue to improve, as the Committee anticipates, the Committee will at some point begin considering an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate on a meeting-by-meeting basis. Before then, the Committee will change its forward guidance. However, it is important to emphasize that a modification of the forward guidance should not be read as indicating that the Committee will necessarily increase the target range in a couple of meetings. Instead the modification should be understood as reflecting the Committee's judgment that conditions have improved to the point where it will soon be the case that a change in the target range could be warranted at any meeting. Provided that labor market conditions continue to improve and further improvement is expected, the Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when, on the basis of incoming data, the Committee is reasonably confident that inflation will move back over the medium term toward our 2 percent objective.It continues to be the FOMC's assessment that even after employment and inflation are near levels consistent with our dual mandate, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run. It is possible, for example, that it may be necessary for the federal funds rate to run temporarily below its normal longer-run level because the residual effects of the financial crisis may continue to weigh on economic activity. As such factors continue to dissipate, we would expect the federal funds rate to move toward its longer-run normal level. In response to unforeseen developments, the Committee will adjust the target range for the federal funds rate to best promote the achievement of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation."
flood,"Vietnam floods and landslides displace 90,000 people as new cyclone nears More than 100 so far reported dead or missing after two storms destroy homes and leave trail of destruction Floods and landslides in Vietnam are reported to have left at least 102 people dead or missing, while tens of thousands of people have lost their homes to rising water.  Two storms that hit central Vietnam in the first two weeks of October, Storm Linfa and Storm Nangka, brought six times higher than average rainfall, flooding 136,000 houses and forcing 90,000 people to evacuate their homes. A third cyclone is expected to hit the coast in the coming days.  Worst hit is Hue province, some 700km (434 miles) away from the capital, Hanoi. Police and soldiers have been using canoes and boats in Ha Tinh city to reach the most flooded areas to evacuate people and move property to safety. In this city alone, more than 20,700 people were reported to have been evacuated."
Typhoon,"As the full devastation of Typhoon Haiyan became more evident Sunday, frustrations were running high among survivors desperate for relief aid three days after the disaster.
Typhoon Haiyan pummeled the Philippines’ eastern seaboard Friday. It flattened buildings and toppled trees, and authorities are still struggling to assess the full extent of damage left behind.
Survivors in some areas hardest-hit do not have access to food, water or an ability to communicate. Even the Philippine Red Cross and the ICRC offices in badly-hit Tacloban had been damaged, forcing staff to relocate temporarily.
“The devastation is ... I don't have the words for it,"" Interior Secretary Mar Roxas said. ""It's really horrific. It's a great human tragedy.""
The country had been bracing for rain and winds, but a massive storm surge of six metres caught the archipelago by surprise Friday, reaching up to a kilometre inland. Residents drowned and were washed away.
With winds that gusted to 275 kilometres per hour, officials say the typhoon was more powerful than 2007’s Hurrican Katrina, and twice as strong as Hurricane Sandy, which devastated parts of Northeastern United States last year.
The destruction is far-reaching:
	_	_stimates say at least 4 million people have been affected by the storm.
	_	_aiyan inflicted serious damage to at least six of the archipelago's more than 7,000 islands
	_	_he islands of Leyte, Samar and the northern part of Cebu appearing to bear the brunt of the storm.
	_	_NICEF estimated that 1.7 million children live in areas affected by the typhoon.
At least 300 people were confirmed dead and 2,000 missing on the eastern island of Samar, where some towns remain inaccessible to emergency crews. An official from the provincial disaster office in Samar said there was no power or cellphone signals.
The death toll in Tacloban, the capital city of Leyte Island, is estimated at 10,000. There, corpses were found laying in the streets, cars floating in water. Homes along the shoreline were severely damaged. In one area of the city, a large ship had been pushed ashore.
Tacloban Mayor Alfred Romualdez said the devastation has touched all residents. “I have not spoken to anyone who has not lost someone, a relative close to them,” he said.
Philippine-born Australian Mila Ward, 53, told The Associated Press that she passed “well over 100” bodies on the street on the way to Tacloban airport.
“They were covered with just anything _ tarpaulin, roofing sheets, cardboard,” she said."
other,"The global outlook remains clouded by the sovereign debt problems in Europe. Notwithstanding this, there has been a general improvement in sentiment over the past month or so following further measures by the European Central Bank and European governments. Equity and commodity prices have picked up after earlier falls, and bond yields in a number of European countries have declined. Nonetheless, further measures by European policymakers will be required over the months ahead for public finances in a number of countries to be placed on a sustainable path.Largely reflecting developments in Europe, official forecasts for global growth have been revised lower, with growth in the world economy now expected to be below trend in 2012, but nothing like as weak as 2008_09. As has been the case over recent years, a significant share of overall growth is expected to come from the emerging market economies, particularly those in Asia. In contrast, in many of the advanced economies a broadly synchronised fiscal consolidation is taking place at a time when both households and financial institutions are also deleveraging, which is likely to be contractionary for growth. As a result, limited progress is expected over the next couple of years in reducing unemployment in these countries."
drought,"The Paraguay River is now on its lowest level in 50 years as the region is reeling from months of extreme drought. The drop in water levels slowed down cargo vessel traffic, resulting in cost overruns for imported goods and a loss of 250 million dollars.
The river has been depleted due to a lack of rainfall in the Pantanal area of Mato Grosso, Brazil. The water flows from that area, running through Bolivia and Argentina. Around 85 percent of Paraguay's foreign trade is conducted through the river.
The crisis has led to major cost overruns for the transport of imported goods such as fuel, fertilizer, and food, as the water depletion slowed down cargo vessel traffic. 
The crisis has also exposed the precariousness of Paraguay’s access to drinking water, the Associated Press (AP) noted.
Nery Giménez, president of the Paraguayan Importers Center, told the AP that the country has never had a situation as serious as this one.
""We have never had a situation as serious as the one we are experiencing now. We are approaching the end of the year, a time when more products must enter.""
Gimenez added that the government had announced the lifting of pandemic-related lockdown, but the river crisis is threatening the resurgence of economic activity."
other,"Since the last MPC meeting in December 2018, there has been a slowdown in global economic activity. Among key advanced economies (AEs), economic activity in the US lost some steam in Q4:2018. The outlook for Q1:2019 is clouded by the partial government shutdown, though the labour market conditions remain strong. In the Euro area, economic activity lost momentum on weak industrial activity. The Japanese economy is gradually recovering and an accommodative monetary policy stance is expected to buttress domestic spending.Economic activity also slowed in some major emerging market economies (EMEs). In China, growth decelerated in Q4:2018. Economic activity in Russia lost pace, with soft oil prices posing a downside risk to growth. The Brazilian economy appeared to have ended 2018 on a firmer note, driven by improved domestic spending and exports, though industrial activity continued to struggle to recover from the disruptions of H1:2018. In South Africa, the economic recovery in Q4:2018 remained gradual, tempered by weak industrial activity and subdued exports.Crude oil prices recovered from their December lows in early January on production cuts, but remain below their peak levels in October. Base metals, which witnessed selling pressures in December on persisting uncertainty over US-China trade frictions, recouped losses in January on expectations of thawing of trade disputes and production disruptions. Gold prices have risen, underpinned by safe haven demand in response to geo-political uncertainty and volatility in equity markets. Inflation edged lower in major AEs and many key EMEs."

drought,"“People die because they are not prepared to face the impacts of the drought – because their livelihoods are not resilient enough,” Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Director-General José Graziano da Silva told an international seminar in Rome, Italy, recalling that more than 250,000 people perished from hunger in the 2011 drought in Somalia.
“Saving livelihoods means saving lives – this is what building resilience is all about,” he added, noting that for years, the focus has been responding to droughts when they happen, rushing to provide emergency assistance and to keep people alive.
While these emergency responses are important, investing in preparedness and resilience puts countries on a footing to act quickly before it is too late, meaning that farmers and rural communities are better positioned to cope with extreme weather when it does hit.
The need for a global drought re-boot is pressing. The many impacts of drought drive not only hunger and instability but cause economic losses up to $8 billion each annually.
As the planet's climate changes, severe dry-spells are becoming more and more frequent. Since the 1970s, the land area in the world affected by situations of drought has doubled.
The burden is especially high in developing countries, where agriculture remains an economic mainstay. Over 80 percent of damage and losses caused by drought are born by agriculture in the developing world, FAO studies have shown.
And Africa in particular has borne the brunt. Between 2005 and 2016, 84 droughts affected 34 different African nations.
At today's event, FAO and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) signed a memorandum of understanding to deepen their cooperation. They will cooperate in improving agro-meteorological data, tools and methods as well as enhancing access by small farmers to products and services to help them anticipate and proactively prepare for droughts.
“WMO provides guidance and scientific information to strengthen national services responsible for addressing drought risks to agriculture,” said WMO Secretary General Petteri Taalas. “We encourage countries to take early action against drought and to move towards a more proactive approach.”
International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD) President Gilbert F. Houngbo in his remarks emphasized the need break the cycle of crisis, disaster and relief, calling on the international community to be proactive and to think not just of today's emergencies, but also of how to prevent tomorrow's.
“This means investing in smallholder farmers to help them address productivity challenges, give them access to markets and finance and most importantly encourage climate-smart agriculture so that when the drought inevitably comes, they have the tools they need to survive and thrive,” said Mr. Houngbo."
Typhoon,"Tropical Storm Arthur crawls closer to North Carolina coast Tropical Storm Arthur crawled closer to the North Carolina coast early Monday. The storm threatened some minor flooding and rough seas as the system moves off the Southeast seaboard. Arthur formed Saturday in waters off Florida, marking the sixth straight year that a named storm has developed before the official June 1 start of the Atlantic hurricane season. Tropical Storm Arthur crawled closer to the North Carolina coast early Monday, amid threats of some minor flooding and rough seas as the system moves off the Southeast seaboard. Arthur formed Saturday in waters off Florida, marking the sixth straight year that a named storm has developed before the official June 1 start of the Atlantic hurricane season. The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami issued a tropical storm warning for North Carolina’s Outer Banks on Sunday. At 2 a.m. EDT, the storm’s center was located about 185 miles (300 kilometers) south-southwest of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Arthur had top sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kph) and was moving to the north-northeast at 12 mph (19 kph). The hurricane center said Arthur is expected to move near or just east of the coast of North Carolina, where 1-3 inches of rain is expected, on Monday and they turn away from the East Coast on Monday night and Tuesday. By Sunday night, the storm’s swirling outer rain bands were skirting closer to the coast. A tropical storm warning was issued for parts of North Carolina’s coast, from Surf City to Duck, including Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds. Michael Lee, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Newport, North Carolina, said tropical-storm-force winds are possible along the coast, particularly in the Outer Banks. “Otherwise, it’s going to be some heavy rainfall for a large part of eastern North Carolina,” Lee said. “But the main threat that we’re really trying to get out there is that there is enhanced risk for dangerous rip currents both today and tomorrow. So, any folks who want to try to go to the beach and get in the water, we have a high risk out for most of our beaches.” The weather service said eastern North Carolina should prepare for some localized flooding and dangerous marine conditions along the coast. “Minor inundation from storm surge is possible for very low-lying areas adjacent to the ocean, sounds, and rivers, with overwash of dunes and flooding of properties and roadways possible for locations where dune structures are weak,” mainly north of Cape Lookout, the weather service said."
earthquake,"Residents of Cape Town have been left shook after a 6.2 magnitude earthquake rocked the region on Saturday night. The substantial tremor rumbled many in the south-west, with residents of Melkbosstrand bearing the brunt of the seismic event.
The actual quake happened some 1 800km offshore, deep in the South Atlantic Ocean. Residents have reported feeling the effects, with houses shaking and the ground moving. Despite taking locals by surprise, it seems the after-effects will be minimal at worst.
The US Geological Survey has concluded that there will be a ‘low threat to life’, due to the earthquake’s strength. Although 6.2 on the Richter Scale does mark a significant event for Cape Town, it’s unlikely that it will trigger a tsunami or any follow-up damage."
earthquake,"The earthquake unleashed dozens of aftershocks, some six kilometres northeast of the city of Majene,  causing heavy damage across the city, including to the five-story Mitra Manakarra Hospital where eight people were reportedly trapped inside.  
“The Governor’s office, two hotels, a mall, a community health centre, and over 300 houses also sustained damage”, said the spokesperson for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Jens Laerke. 
Local authorities have reported that 638 people have been injured and more than 18,000 have been temporarily displaced to 10 evacuation sites.  
However, these numbers are expected to increase as assessments continue.  
“The earthquake interrupted the access road between?Majene?and the provincial capital?Mamuju?in three different locations”, said Mr. Laerke.  
“Electricity, communications network and fuel supply have also been disrupted”, he added.
The OCHA spokesperson pointed out that the earthquake?followed?a 5.7 magnitude shock that rocked the same area on Thursday afternoon.? 
The chief of Indonesia’s Meteorology and Geophysics agency, Dwikorita Karnawati, warned that strong aftershocks could follow, telling a news conference that there had already been at least 26, after the two quakes had rocked the area, since Thursday afternoon. 
“The structures of the materials and rocks under the earth are unstable or weak after 28 tremors, and these may cause an underwater landslide and trigger a tsunami”, she said, recommending that people stay away from the coast if another strong quake strikes."
other,"Increases in energy prices resulted in a pickup in consumer price inflation in the second half of last year, but oil prices have flattened out over recent months, and most indicators suggest that inflation likely will be subdued for some time. Slack in labor and product markets has reduced wage and price pressures in most markets, and sharp increases in productivity have further reduced producers' unit labor costs. The cost of shelter, which receives a heavy weight in consumer price indexes, is rising very slowly, reflecting high vacancy rates. In addition, according to most measures, longer-term inflation expectations have remained relatively stable.The improvement in financial markets that began last spring continues. Conditions in short-term funding markets have returned to near pre-crisis levels. Many (mostly larger) firms have been able to issue corporate bonds or new equity and do not seem to be hampered by a lack of credit. In contrast, bank lending continues to contract, reflecting both tightened lending standards and weak demand for credit amid uncertain economic prospects.In conjunction with the January meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), Board members and Reserve Bank presidents prepared projections for economic growth, unemployment, and inflation for the years 2010 through 2012 and over the longer run. The contours of these forecasts are broadly similar to those I reported to the Congress last July. FOMC participants continue to anticipate a moderate pace of economic recovery, with economic growth of roughly 3 to 3-1/2 percent in 2010 and 3-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent in 2011. Consistent with moderate economic growth, participants expect the unemployment rate to decline only slowly, to a range of roughly 6-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent by the end of 2012, still well above their estimate of the long-run sustainable rate of about 5 percent. Inflation is expected to remain subdued, with consumer prices rising at rates between 1 and 2 percent in 2010 through 2012. In the longer term, inflation is expected to be between 1-3/4 and 2 percent, the range that most FOMC participants judge to be consistent with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment."

He replaced Yellen, who had a Ph.D. in the subject, last month.Like many economists, Powell says that the slow pace of wage growth is a bit of a puzzle. With the unemployment rate at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent and businesses loudly complaining that they can¡¯t find enough workers, economic theory suggests that employers should be raising pay more quickly than their current pace of about 2.5 percent a year.¡°I¡¯ve been surprised by that, and I think others have as well,¡± Powell says during his first press conference as Fed chairman.Still, he suggested some explanations: Paychecks largely reflect the pace of inflation and the growth of productivity, a measure of how efficient workers are.

The eruption of Mount Nyiragongo on Saturday night sent about 5,000 people fleeing from the city of Goma across the nearby border into Rwanda, while another 25,000 others sought refuge to the northwest in Sake, the U.N. children’s agency said Sunday. More than 170 children were still feared missing Sunday, and UNICEF officials said they were organizing transit centers to help unaccompanied children in the wake of the disaster."
wildfires,"One year has passed since the world was shocked by the images of the fires blazing across the Amazon in Brazil. But since then, the forest hasn’t stopped burning —and 2020 could be even more devastating for the rainforest and the Indigenous Peoples who call it home. Last week, Greenpeace Brazil flew over the state of Mato Grosso to capture images of the Amazon. Even though the government had ordered a ban on forest fires in the state starting at the beginning of July, the photos show smoke, flames, and just how ineffective the ban has been.
Last year, more than 1 million hectares of forest were burned, and the trend shows the destruction is far from over. Last June, more than two thousand fire hotspots were registered in the Amazon, the highest number in the last thirteen years. Since Brazil’s President Bolsonaro took office in January 2019, his government’s agenda has been very clear: dismantle environmental protection law and agencies, so that forest destroyers can burn the forest freely, clearing the land to turn it into pastures, without being held accountable. 
The consequences of this destruction are dire. From Siberia to the Amazon, fires are raging across the world. Losing our forests means losing the fight against the climate crisis, putting biodiversity at risk of extinction, and threatening the lives of Indigenous Peoples who depend on the forest standing for their survival. Fighting to protect the forest and Indigenous lands from fires and deforestation become even more difficult—and crucial —during a pandemic. 
With a mortality rate from COVID-19 150% higher than the Brazilian average, Indigenous Peoples are already more vulnerable during the pandemic. The smoke from the fires will put their respiratory system at even higher risk during a time when access to healthcare is limited in remote areas in the Amazon.
But things can be different. After the public’s outcry last year, there is increasing pressure on Brazil’s government. Investors, companies and governments have been signaling their concerns about the destruction of the forest and its impact on the environment, and their message is clear: they don’t want to do business with forest destroyers. Even though last week Bolsonaro announced a “fire moratorium” for 120 days, the images of Mato Grosso show how his measures have been performative and inefficient."
wildfires,"A multi-headed monster. An animal of fire. The Beast.
As it raged out of control across northern Alberta and burst into Fort McMurray with unparalleled ferocity, the wildfire began racking up a list of colourful nicknames.
Within the span of a few days, the blaze had swelled in size, from some 1,200 hectares (3,000 acres) to more than 220,000 hectares (544,000 acres) . It cut a path of destruction through Fort McMurray, a city in the heart of Alberta’s oilsands, forcing the evacuation of more than 88,000 people and flattening some parts of the city, leaving a trail of charred rubble in its wake.
Few on the front lines had ever seen anything like it. “It’s an unprecedented fire with respect to the rate it spread, how it involved the community,” said regional fire chief Darby Allen earlier this week, after cooler temperatures and higher humidity allowed crews to get a handle on the fire.
“The way this thing happened, the way it travelled, the way it behaved – they’re rewriting their formulas on how fires behave, based on this fire,” he said.
So what made this fire different from the hundreds of others that ignite yearly in the region, or other wildfires around the world? “We’ve had faster fire speeds, we’ve had bigger fires, but this one, in terms of impact and where it landed, it is definitely historic,” explained Chad Morrison, Alberta’s manager of wildfire prevention.
A 2011 fire in northern Alberta grew to more than 700,000 hectares (1.7m acres). Another, in 1951, burned some 1.4m hectares (3.5m acres), becoming one of the largest recorded fires ever seen in North America. But these fires burned in remote areas of the province, Morrison said. “I don’t think we’ve ever seen a community of this size and scale be impacted by a wildfire of this size and ferocity.”
The fire pitted firefighting crews – often more used to battling blazing houses or apartments – against a wildfire capable of sweeping through entire neighbourhoods. Firefighters managed to save around 85% of the city, leaving an estimated 2,400 homes and buildings to the flames.
The cause of the extreme fire, which first ignited in a remote forested area, remains under investigation."
other,"The Australian economy is performing well, and a little stronger than earlier expected. GDP growth is running above 3 per cent. The unemployment rate has declined noticeably, reaching 5 per cent in the month of September. As flagged three months ago, inflation declined in the September quarter, largely because childcare prices fell and utilities price inflation moderated. More generally, inflation remains low and stable. Stronger growth and labour market conditions can be expected to generate a gradual lift in wages growth and inflation over time. The Bank's forecasts for growth and inflation have been upgraded slightly in light of recent data. GDP growth is now expected to be around 3_ per cent on average over 2018 and 2019, but to ease in the latter part of the forecast period as production of some resource commodities stabilises at high levels. Headline and underlying inflation are both expected to rise to be a little above 2_ per cent by the end of 2020.The global economic outlook remains positive. Although growth has slowed in some economies, it remains above trend in the major advanced economies. Spare capacity in these economies is likely to diminish further, putting upward pressure on global inflation. Rising trade tensions are expected to weigh a little on growth in the United States and a few economies in east Asia, but the US fiscal stimulus and still-accommodative monetary policy remain supportive of continued economic expansion. Growth in Australia's major trading partners is expected to slow slightly over the next couple of years."
other,"With a view to increasing the focus of liquidity measures on revival of activity in specific sectors that have both backward and forward linkages and having multiplier effects on growth, the RBI had announced the On Tap TLTRO scheme on October 9, 2020 for five sectors which was available up to March 31, 2021. Stressed sectors identified by the Kamath Committee were also brought within the ambit of the scheme on December 4, 2020 and subsequently bank lending to NBFCs on February 5, 2021. On April 7, the scheme was extended by a period of six months, i.e., till September 30, 2021. Given the nascent and fragile economic recovery, it has now been decided to extend the On Tap TLTRO scheme further by a period of three months, i.e., till December 31, 2021.On March 27, 2020 banks were allowed to avail of funds under the marginal standing facility (MSF) by dipping into the Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) up to an additional one per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL), i.e., cumulatively up to 3 per cent of NDTL. This facility, which was initially available up to June 30, 2020 was later extended in phases up to March 31, 2021 and again for a further period of six months till September 30, 2021, providing comfort to banks on their liquidity requirements and also to enable them to meet their Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) requirements. This dispensation provides increased access to funds to the extent of _1.62 lakh crore and qualifies as high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) for the LCR. It has now been decided to continue with the MSF relaxation for a further period of three months, i.e., up to December 31, 2021."
other,"The MPC notes that there are several uncertainties surrounding the baseline inflation path. First, the revised formula for MSP as announced in the Union Budget 2018-19 for kharif crops may have an impact on inflation, although the exact magnitude will be known only in the coming months. Second, the staggered impact of HRA revisions by various state governments may push headline inflation up. While the statistical impact of the HRA revisions will be looked through, there is a need to watch out for any second round effects. Third, in case there is any further fiscal slippage from the Union Budget estimates for 2018-19 or the medium-term path, it could adversely impact the outlook on inflation. There are also risks to inflation from fiscal slippages at the level of states on account of higher committed revenue expenditure. Fourth, should the monsoon turn deficient temporally and/or spatially, it may have a significant bearing on food inflation. Fifth, firms polled in the Reserve Bank¡¯s Industrial Outlook Survey expect input and output prices to rise, going forward. Sixth, recent volatility in crude prices has imparted considerable uncertainty to the near-term outlook.Against the above backdrop, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate on hold and continue with the neutral stance. The MPC reiterates its commitment to achieving the medium-term target for headline inflation of 4 per cent on a durable basis.The MPC notes that growth has been recovering and the output gap is closing. This is also reflected in a pick-up in credit offtake in recent months. The large mobilisation of resources from the primary capital market should support investment activity further. While the domestic cyclical recovery is underway, the long-term growth potential is also expected to be reinforced by various structural reforms introduced in the recent past. On the downside, the deterioration in public finances risks crowding out private financing and investment. Furthermore, even as global growth and trade have been strengthening, rising trade protectionism and financial market volatility could derail the ongoing global recovery. In this unsettling global environment, it is especially important that domestic macroeconomic fundamentals are strengthened, deleveraging of distressed corporates and rebuilding of bank balance sheets persisted with, and the risk-sharing markets deepened.Dr. Chetan Ghate, Dr. Pami Dua, Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, Dr. Viral V. Acharya and Dr. Urjit R. Patel voted in favour of the monetary policy decision. Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra voted for an increase in the policy rate of 25 basis points.

Manchester United fans will feel confident that its side can get into the knockout stages after being given a favorable draw against last year's Europa League winner Villarreal, Atalanta and Young Boys.
The first round of group stage fixtures is set to take place on September 14 and 15, with the final set for St. Petersburg, Russia, on May 28, 2022."
drought,"“I once rescued a friend from drowning when he was swept away by the force of the current as we were swimming in the Diyala river,” says Qasim Sabti, a painter and gallery owner in Baghdad.
“That was 50 years ago,” he recalls. “I went back there recently and the water in the Diyala is so shallow today that a man could walk across it with his dog.”
The rivers of Iraq, above all the Tigris and Euphrates, are drying up. The country is becoming more arid, and desertification is eating into the limited amount of agricultural land.
Dams built upriver in Turkey, Syria and Iran since the 1970s have reduced the flow of water that reaches Iraq by as much as half and the situation is about to get worse.
“On 1 July, Turkey will start filling the Ilisu dam on the Tigris and this will cause another decline in the inflows to our country of about 50 per cent,” Hassan Janabi, minister of water resources, told The Independent.
He says that Iraq used to get 30 billion cubic metres of water a year from the Euphrates, but now “we are happy if we get 16 billion cubic metres”.
As Iraq begins to recover from 40 years of wars and emergences, its existence is being threatened by the rapidly falling water levels in the two great rivers on which its people depend.
It was on their banks that the first cities were established cities 8,000 years ago and where the flood stories of Gilgamesh and the Bible were first told.
Such floods are now a thing of the past _ the last was in 1988 _ and each year the amount of water taken by Iraq’s neighbours has been rising."
other,"At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken forceful actions to provide support and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to households, businesses, and communities. Today I will review the current economic situation before turning to monetary policy.The path of the economy continues to depend significantly on the course of the virus and the measures undertaken to control its spread. The resurgence in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in recent months is causing great hardship for millions of Americans and is weighing on economic activity and job creation. Following a sharp rebound in economic activity last summer, momentum slowed substantially, with the weakness concentrated in the sectors most adversely affected by the resurgence of the virus. In recent weeks, the number of new cases and hospitalizations has been falling, and ongoing vaccinations offer hope for a return to more normal conditions later this year. However, the economic recovery remains uneven and far from complete, and the path ahead is highly uncertain.Household spending on services remains low, especially in sectors that typically require people to gather closely, including leisure and hospitality. In contrast, household spending on goods picked up encouragingly in January after moderating late last year. The housing sector has more than fully recovered from the downturn, while business investment and manufacturing production have also picked up. The overall recovery in economic activity since last spring is due in part to unprecedented fiscal and monetary actions, which have provided essential support to many households, businesses, and communities.As with overall economic activity, the pace of improvement in the labor market has slowed. Over the three months ending in January, employment rose at an average monthly rate of only 29,000. Continued progress in many industries has been tempered by significant losses in industries such as leisure and hospitality, where the resurgence in the virus and increased social distancing have weighed further on activity. The unemployment rate remained elevated at 6.3 percent in January, and participation in the labor market is notably below pre-pandemic levels. Although there has been much progress in the labor market since the spring, millions of Americans remain out of work. As discussed in the February Monetary Policy Report, the economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been the hardest hit. In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe for lower-wage workers and for African Americans, Hispanics, and other minority groups. The economic dislocation has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future."
other,"The U.S. economy remained sluggish in the first half of 2008, and steep increases in commodity prices boosted consumer price inflation. The housing market continued to contract, weighing on overall economic activity. Against a backdrop of mounting losses incurred by major financial institutions, financial market conditions deteriorated sharply further toward the end of the first quarter--a development that threatened to severely impair the functioning of the overall financial system and to hinder economic growth. In response, the Federal Reserve undertook a number of significant actions to address liquidity pressures faced by banks and other financial institutions, thereby augmenting the liquidity-enhancing measures implemented in the second half of 2007. Taken together, these measures fostered some improvement in the functioning of financial markets, but considerable strains persist. In view of the implications of the substantial reduction in credit availability and the continuing decline in housing activity for the economic outlook, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) further eased the stance of monetary policy. After cutting the target federal funds rate 100 basis points in the second half of 2007, the FOMC reduced rates another 225 basis points over the first four months of 2008. The further easing of policy was seen as consistent with fostering price stability over time, given the Committee's expectation that a flattening-out of energy prices and increasing economic slack would damp inflationary pressures."
drought,"The High-Level Meeting of the inaugural African Drought Conference, comprising African member States and Parties to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), adopted an overarching Strategic Framework to enhance resilience to the impact of drought events in Africa, issued the ‘The Windhoek Declaration,’ and underscored the importance of drought resilience in achieving Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The Drought Conference took place from 15-19 August 2016 in Windhoek, Namibia, following the conclusion of the 3rd Africa Drylands Week. It was hosted by the Government of Namibia, with support from the UNCCD, the African Union (AU) and diverse partners. The Conference was one of the main outcomes of the Namibia Declaration adopted at the 11th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 11) to the UNCCD, which emphasized a stronger UNCCD to achieve the SDG target 15:3 on land degradation neutrality through an increased focus on mitigating the impacts of droughts and the development of national drought policies.
The High-Level Meeting issued ‘The Windhoek Declaration for Enhancing Resilience to Drought in Africa,’ which calls for operationalization of the Strategic Framework for Drought Risk Management and Enhancing Resilience in Africa, and the implementation of ‘Drought Resilient and Prepared Africa’ (DRAPA) programmes at the national level. It requests African Union Heads of State and Government to “adopt a decision under the framework of the UNCCD” to develop a binding protocol on Drought Risk Management for Enhancing Resilience to be submitted for consideration to the UNCCD COP 13 in 2017.
The Windhoek Declaration also notes the need for all African countries and partners to ensure that the implementation of the Strategic Framework is considered as part of national SDG implementation frameworks and to enhance synergies among the existing international agreements and other Conventions particularly among the three Rio Conventions, namely the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), UNCCD and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
The Strategic Framework was finalized during the technical segment of the Drought Conference, which also considered, among other issues: African perspectives on drought, land degradation and desertification; linkages to the SDGs and the African Union’s Agenda 2063; outcomes of the 3rd Africa Drylands Week; best practices in drought management; national, regional and global drought monitoring and early warning systems; vulnerability assessments; innovative sources of finance for enhancing resilience to drought events; and appropriate response and relief measures during and after drought events.
Conference participants committed themselves to, inter alia: establish a continent-wide African Network with national institutions for Drought Monitoring and Early Warning Systems; convene a biennial African Drought Conference concurrently with the African Drylands Week to consider progress on implementation of the Strategy; facilitate timely drought information, vulnerability and impact assessment, and mitigation measures at the country, regional and continental levels; and systematically and strategically tap into existing financing opportunities, in particular climate change adaptation financing and other financing mechanisms including from the private sector.
The African Drought Conference was preceded by the 3rd Africa Drylands Week from 8-12 August 2016, which convened under the theme of ‘Promoting sustainable development in African drylands.’ Discussions brought together diverse stakeholders, including representatives of farmers, women and youth organizations, scientists, policy and decision makers, practitioners and development specialists, with a focus on the sub-themes of land tenure, migration, conflict and land valuation in drylands, and opportunities presented by the SDGs and the Paris Agreement on climate change.
The Week also sought to build the scientific basis for the implementation of African Drylands initiatives and to strengthen synergies in the implementation of the Great Green Wall for the Sahara and the Sahel Initiative (GGWSSI) and other flagship drought and resilience programmes. Participants called for the Africa Drylands Week to be institutionalized by the African Union Assembly, as a regular and sustained means of promoting development in drylands.
The Drylands Week was co-organized by the African Union Commission (AUC), the Government of Namibia, the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) Planning and Coordinating Agency, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), the Permanent Inter-States Committee on the Control of Drought in the Sahel (CILSS), and other international and regional partners, with support from the African Union (AU) and the European Union.
In the lead up to the Drylands Week and Drought Conference, publications released by the World Bank and UNCCD highlighted new data as well as innovative approaches to building drought resilience in Africa. The UNCCD study, titled ‘The ripple effect: A fresh approach to reducing drought impacts and building resilience,’ calls for proactive and “risk-based” approaches to tackling the impacts of droughts, floods and other extreme weather events in an integrated way. The publication presents new data on the interlinkages between drought and water scarcity, and notes that demand for water is estimated to grow by an estimated 55% by 2050, which could lead to a loss of up to 6% of the gross domestic product (GDP) of some regions. The publication highlights the impact of climate change on water scarcity and food price volatility, and explores how drought and falling land productivity impact migration and conflict."

other,"Although markets remained relatively calm and stable during most part of 2017 and January 2018 even in the wake of the unwinding of the Fed¡¯s balance sheet, financial markets turned volatile in February and went into swift correction on fears of faster rate hikes by the US Fed. Early March also witnessed the return of volatility on announcement of protectionist measures by the US and the momentary calm was shattered by intensification of trade protectionism between China and the US. The growing financial market integration in recent years has led to spillovers of volatility from AEs to EMEs due to monetary policy actions and financial events, as witnessed recently (Box V.1).Equity prices have risen across most AEs and EMEs on improving global growth prospects and still accommodative monetary policy stances (Chart V.8a). The Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) World Index increased by 3.9 per cent between October 2017 and March 2018. Equity markets, which had surged during Q4:2017 and January 2018, tanked due to sharp sell-offs across the globe during February on rising interest rate concerns in the US. Just when the equity market in the US began to recover with investors shrugging off fears of inflation worries, volatility returned in March on announcement of US trade policies. In the euro area, equity prices have remained under pressure, lagging behind most peers on expectations of lower corporate earnings and revenue due to a strong euro. Also negotiations surrounding Brexit and election in some member countries adversely impacted investor sentiment. In Japan, a rally in share prices during 2017 and early 2018 was driven by stronger economic performance, higher corporate earnings and lower corporate tax rates. In February, Japanese stock markets cooled during the global stock market sell-off, with the rising yen also slicing away some gains."
drought,"Tourists flock by the thousands to the coastal town of Mendocino for its Victorian homes and cliff trails, but visitors this summer are also finding public portable toilets and signs on picket fences pleading: ""Severe Drought. Please conserve water.""
Hotels have closed their lobby bathrooms and residents have stopped watering their gardens in the foggy outpost about 150 miles (240 kilometers) north of San Francisco after two years of little rain sapped many of the wells Mendocino depends on for potable water.
Mendocino's water woes were compounded in recent weeks when the city of Fort Bragg a few miles to the north — its main backup water supplier — informed officials that it, too, had a significant drop in its drinking water reserves after the Noyo River recorded its lowest flows in decades.
""This is a real emergency,"" said Ryan Rhoades, superintendent of the Mendocino City Community Services District, which helps manage the water in the town’s aquifer.
Eric Hillesland and his wife normally wouldn't need to buy water until late July or August to supply the Alegria Inn, their 10-room oceanfront bed and breakfast. But the property’s well started pumping little water early in the year, and by February they were ordering 3,500 gallons (13 kilolitres) a week.
Then the couple stopped watering the gardens and switched from glass to paper plates to serve welcome cookies. They plan to start using microfiber bed linens, which take less water to wash.
""We’re also asking our guests to be cognizant of the severity of our water shortage and to not take the extensive showers they might be used to at home,"" Hillesland said.
Mendocino relies on groundwater accessed through a network of about 400 privately owned wells, many of them dug by hand when the former mill town was established in the 1850s. Residents and business owners keep their water in storage tanks, including some perched atop historic redwood water towers."
earthquake,"Tsunami warnings as third strong earthquake strikes off New Zealand WELLINGTON (REUTERS) _ Evacuation orders were issued for New Zealanders living in some areas on the east coast on the North Island after a third earthquake struck in the area on Friday (March 5). The latest was a magnitude 8.0 quake that struck the Kermadec Islands, north-east of New Zealand’s North Island. This came shortly after a 7.4 magnitude earthquake in the same region. Earlier, another large 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck about 900km away on the east of the North Island and was felt by tens of thousands, causing its own tsunami warning. This warning was later lifted. New Zealand’s National Emergency Management Agency (Nema) issued a tsunami warning saying areas under threat were from the Bay of Islands to Whangarei, from Matata to Tolaga Bay including Whakatane and Opotiki, and the Great Barrier Island. “People near the coast in the following areas must move immediately to the nearest high ground, out of all tsunami evacuation zones, or as far inland as possible. DO NOT STAY AT HOME,” Nema said on Twitter."

drought,"As it copes with a searing drought, California has taken drastic measures, including a mandate by Gov. Jerry Brown that city-dwellers cut their water use by 25 percent.
That move stands in stark contrast to one made by Gov. Rick Perry in 2011, when Texas was at the height of its arguably worst-ever drought: He asked Texans to pray for rain.
But as the state grows drier and its population booms, Texas might soon find itself having to make the same sort of hard decisions that have become so common in California, experts say.
“There are certain things that have happened in California that are on their way to Texas,” said Wes Strickland, a water lawyer at the law firm Jackson Walker LLP who practices in both states.
Chief among those is environmental litigation, and the restrictions that come along with it, he said.
In fundamental ways, the states are different when it comes to water supplies and geography, with California appearing the more vulnerable. While Texas water supplies are fragmented, California’s are interconnected, with massive water pipelines pulling water from the mountain-top snowpacks in the state’s northeast and sending it to the more arid farming communities in its center.
Yet the very things that have insulated Texas from wider disputes — a regional focus on water planning, with very distinct approaches to regulating river water and groundwater — could lead to internecine battles as supplies grow more precious.
Texas has seen a few such clashes: Environmentalists and farmers in the Guadalupe and Brazos river basins have gone to court to fight for water jeopardized by drought. And ratcheted-up efforts to move underground water to fast-growing cities have been met with anger in the rural areas from which the water originates, with some residents accusing deal-makers of a “water grab.”"

other,"In the fifth bi-monthly monetary policy resolution in December 2018, CPI inflation for 2018-19 was projected in the range of 2.7-3.2 per cent in H2:2018-19 and 3.8-4.2 per cent in H1:2019-20, with risks tilted to the upside. The actual inflation outcome at 2.6 per cent in Q3:2018-19 was marginally lower than the projection. There have been downward revisions in inflation projections during the course of the year, reflecting mainly the unprecedented soft inflation recorded across food sub-groups.Several factors will shape the inflation path, going forward. First, food inflation has continued to surprise on the downside with continuing deflation across several items and a significant moderation in inflation in cereals. Several food groups are experiencing excess supply conditions domestically as well as internationally. Hence, the short-term outlook for food inflation appears particularly benign, despite adverse base effects. Secondly, the moderation in the fuel group was larger than anticipated. Inflation in items of rural consumption such as firewood and chips, which had remained sticky and at elevated levels, has collapsed in recent months. Electricity prices also showed an unexpected moderation, providing a softer outlook for the fuel group. Thirdly, while inflation excluding food and fuel remains elevated, the recent unusual pick-up in the prices of health and education could be a one-off phenomenon. Fourthly, the crude oil price outlook remains broadly the same as in the December policy. Fifthly, the Reserve Bank¡¯s surveys show that inflation expectations of households as well as input and output price expectations of producers have moderated significantly. Finally, the effect of the HRA increase for central government employees has dissipated completely along expected lines. Taking into consideration these developments and assuming a normal monsoon in 2019, the path of CPI inflation is revised downwards to 2.8 per cent in Q4:2018-19, 3.2-3.4 per cent in H1:2019-20 and 3.9 per cent in Q3:2019-20, with risks broadly balanced around the central trajectory.Turning to the growth outlook, GDP growth for 2018-19 in the December policy was projected at 7.4 per cent (7.2-7.3 per cent in H2) and at 7.5 per cent for H1:2019-20, with risks somewhat to the downside. The CSO has estimated GDP growth at 7.2 per cent for 2018-19. Looking beyond the current year, the growth outlook is likely to be influenced by the following factors. First, aggregate bank credit and overall financial flows to the commercial sector continue to be strong, but are yet to be broad-based. Secondly, in spite of soft crude oil prices and the lagged impact of the recent depreciation of the Indian rupee on net exports, slowing global demand could pose headwinds. In particular, trade tensions and associated uncertainties appear to be moderating global growth. Taking into consideration the above factors, GDP growth for 2019-20 is projected at 7.4 per cent _ in the range of 7.2-7.4 per cent in H1, and 7.5 per cent in Q3 _ with risks evenly balanced."

drought,"Puerto Rico's governor has declared a state of emergency on Monday, June 30, 2020, due to worsening drought-- prompting the government to resort to water rationing that will leave 140 000 without access to running water. Drought conditions have rapidly expanded since May, with almost 60 percent of the country already under a dry spell as of June 23, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.
21 out of 78 municipalities are suffering from moderate drought conditions, while 29 others are affected by a severe dry spell, governor Wanda Vasquez said.
On May 12, a few areas were abnormally dry but there were no spots classified in drought. The conditions expanded as rainfall deficits in parts of the country are running 102 to 203 mm (4 to 8 inches) below average over the last 30 days. 
Dry air linked to Saharan dust moving across the Caribbean has suppressed any chances of widespread rain, but there have been storms that are hit or miss.
About 140 000 homes and businesses will be affected by water rationing, which will cut off water for 24 hours every other day.
Some communities in the northeast region have already been experiencing water rationing since early June.
Local authorities have also taken other measures to provide water, such as using wells and changing the water source for more than 30 000 Carraizo clients to a different reservoir."
other,"On the domestic front, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) released its second advance estimates for 2016-17 on February 28, placing India¡¯s real GVA growth at 6.7 per cent for the year, down from 7 per cent in the first advance estimates released on January 6. Agriculture expanded robustly year-on-year after two consecutive years of sub-one per cent growth. In the industrial sector, there was a significant loss of momentum across all categories, barring electricity generation. The services sector also slowed, pulled down by trade, hotels, transport and communication as well as financial, real estate and professional services. Public administration, defence and other services cushioned this slowdown. To some extent, government expenditure made up for weakness in private consumption and capital formation.Several indicators are pointing to a modest improvement in the macroeconomic outlook. Foodgrains production has touched an all-time high of 272 million tonnes, with record production of rice, wheat and pulses. The record production of wheat should boost procurement operations and economise on imports, which had recently surged. Rice stocks, which had depleted to close to the minimum buffer norm, have picked up with kharif procurement. The bumper production of pulses has helped in building up to the intended buffer stock (i.e., 20 lakh tonnes) and this will keep the price of pulses under check _ the domestic price of pulses has already fallen below the minimum support price (MSP).Industrial output, measured by the index of industrial production (IIP), recovered in January from a contraction in the previous month, helped by a broad-based turnaround in manufacturing as well as mining and quarrying. Capital goods production improved appreciably, although this largely reflected the waning of unfavourable base effects. Consumer non-durables continued, however, to contract for the second successive month in spite of supportive base effects. Thus, investment and rural consumption demand remain muted. The output of core industries moderated in February due to slowdown in production of all the components except coal. The manufacturing purchasing managers¡¯ index (PMI) remained in expansion mode in February and rose to a five month high in March on the back of growth of new orders and output. The future output index also rose strongly on forecasts of pick-up in demand and the launch of new product lines. The 77th round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s industrial outlook survey indicates that overall business sentiment is expected to improve in Q1 of 2017-18 on the back of a sharp pick up in both domestic and external demand. Coincident indicators such as exports and non-oil non-gold imports are indicative of a brighter outlook for industry, although the sizable under-utilisation of capacity in several industries could operate as a drag on investment."

""This will ensure that all flood victims will be evacuated immediately and provided with food assistance."

other,"The Australian economy is evolving broadly as expected. The Bank's forecasts are little changed from those published in the May Statement on Monetary Policy. The economy is expected to grow at an annual rate of around 3 per cent over the next couple of years, which is a bit higher than estimates of potential growth. The unemployment rate is accordingly expected to edge lower. Underlying inflation is higher than late last year; it is expected to reach around 2 per cent over the second half of 2017 and increase a little thereafter. The forecast for headline inflation has been revised a little higher, and lies between 2 and 3 per cent over much of the forecast period.The outlook continues to be supported by accommodative monetary policy and an improvement in the global economy. Recent GDP data for Australia's major trading partners have been broadly consistent with the Bank's earlier expectations. Growth in the major advanced economies has been above potential rates for some time, with recent data showing that GDP growth in the June quarter was generally a bit stronger than in the previous quarter. Stronger global activity has been especially evident in international trade, which, along with accommodative policies, has supported growth in much of the Asian region. More recently, business investment growth has picked up in a number of economies."
other,"The reserve requirement system is that whereby financial institutions are obliged to hold a certain ratio of their liabilities subject to reserve requirements (reserve requirement ratio) in their accounts with the central bank. The central bank can adjust liquidity in the markets and promote financial stability by changing financial institutions' funding situation through adjustment of the reserve requirement ratios. For example, since raising the reserve requirement ratios causes banks to deposit more money as their required reserves, their capacity to provide loans and purchase securities is reduced, thus leading to a decline in the volume of money in circulation. Consequently, liquidity is reduced and the possibility of financial unrest arising from an excessive increase in lending can be averted.Reserve requirements are still regarded as an important monetary policy tool in a number of major countries including Korea, although used less frequently than in the past as the monetary base-focused orientation of monetary policy has shifted to an interest rate-focused orientation around the world from the 1980s. This is ascribable to its great usefulness in that it not only ensures seamless payments and settlements among financial institutions across their checking accounts with the central bank by having them hold a certain proportion of their reserves in the accounts, but it also enhances the efficiency of interest rate policy by stabilizing short-term market ratesThe financial institutions subject to the current reserve requirement regime include commercial banks and specialized banks. These institutions are required to maintain reserves corresponding to their reserve requirement ratios differentiated within a range between 0~7% depending upon their deposit liability types**. Meanwhile, under the revised Bank of Korea Act, from December 17, 2011*** reserve requirements can be imposed on some types of bank debentures as well as the existing deposit liabilities. Financial institutions should maintain the required reserve in the Bank of Korea in the form of current deposits, but they may hold up to 35% of their reserves in the form of vault cash consisting of banknotes of the Bank of Korea.Reserve requirements may be imposed on the following Korean won denominated bank debentures whose maturity is less than 2 years: In periods of pronounced or likely monetary expansion, bank debentures issued by commercial banks during the periods deemed necessary to accumulate more reserves; or in periods of pronounced monetary expansion, bank debentures issued by specialized banks _ National Agricultural Cooperative Federation, National Federation of Fisheries Cooperatives, Industrial Bank of Korea, Korea Development Bank _ during periods determined by the Monetary Policy Board after consultation with the government regarding whether reserves should be accumulated and the periods of such accumulation.

Typhoon,"A typhoon causing deadly mudslides that buried people and destroyed homes on a Japanese island this morning has killed at least 17 people.
Typhoon Wipha swept up the Pacific coast, grounding hundreds of flights and disrupting Tokyo's transportation during the morning rush.
Dozens of homes were destroyed and more than 50 people are thought to still be missing.
Hardest hit was Izu Oshima island about 120 kilometers (75 miles) south of Tokyo. Rescuers retrieved the bodies of 13 people, most of them buried by mudslides, authorities said. “We have no idea how bad the extent of damage could be,” town official Hinani Uematsu added.
One woman from Tokyo died after falling into a river and being washed 10 km downriver to Yokohama, police said. Two sixth-grade boys and another person were missing on Japan's main island, Honshu, the Fire and Disaster Management Agency said.
More than 350 homes have been damaged or destroyed, including 283 on Izu Oshima, it said.
Typhoon Wipha, which stayed offshore in the Pacific, had sustained winds of 126 kilometers per hour (78 mph) with gusts up to 180 kph.
More than 80 centimetres (30 inches) of rain fell on Izu Oshima during a 24-hour period, the highest amount noted since record keeping began in 1991.
The rainfall was so heavy before dawn that people in the area could not ""see anything or hear anything,” Japan Meteorological Agency official Yoshiaki Yano said.
Izu Oshima is the largest island in the Izu chain southwest of Tokyo. It has one of Japan's most active volcanoes, Mount Mihara, and is a major base for growing camellias. About 8,200 people live on the island, which is accessible by ferry from Tokyo.

wildfires,"Dozens of wildfires continued to burn out of control across tinder-dry Texas on Monday as calls went out for off-duty firefighters around the region to report for duty.
The Texas Forest Service reported 56 separate fires on Sunday that had burned some 30,000 acres. Neighborhoods across eastern and central parts of the state were reporting widespread damage.

Authorities said the fires were propelled partly by the high winds brought by Tropical Storm Lee. A late-summer cool front brought winds of 30 to 40 mph to the region, which is already gripped by one of the worst droughts in history.
The National Weather Service said South, Central and East Texas were all under ""red flag"" warnings for critical fire conditions until late Sunday night.
'We're On Every Fire We Can Possibly Handle'
In the East Texas community of Gladewater, a blaze killed a 20-year-old woman and her toddler daughter who were caught unawares in their mobile home. A longtime Texas sheriff called the Gladewater blaze the fastest-moving fire he has ever seen. Six homes were toppled within minutes, including the mobile home.
""The houses that were in its path on this particular roadway were taken out,"" Gregg County Sheriff Maxey Cerliano said. ""There were many other houses that the fire got right up to the porch.""
Forest Service officials estimated some 1,400 acres were burned in that area alone, destroying homes, barns and vehicles, and thousands of other acres were scorched in other parts of the state.
""We've completely depleted our resources,"" Melanie Spradling, a public information officer with the Texas Forest Service, told the Tyler Morning Telegraph. ""We're on every fire we can possibly handle and then some.""

other,"After declining for a year and a half, economic activity in the United States turned up in the second half of 2009, supported by an improvement in financial conditions, stimulus from monetary and fiscal policies, and a recovery in foreign economies. These factors, along with increased business and household confidence, appear likely to boost spending and sustain the economic expansion. However, the pace of the recovery probably will be tempered by households' desire to rebuild wealth, still-tight credit conditions facing some borrowers, and, despite some tentative signs of stabilization, continued weakness in labor markets. With substantial resource slack continuing to suppress cost pressures and with longer-term inflation expectations stable, inflation is likely to be subdued for some time."

Typhoon,"A typhoon swelled rivers and flooded low-lying areas as it passed over the storm-battered northeastern Philippines, leaving at least 13 people dead and 15 others missing, officials said Thursday.
The Philippine National Police reported the casualty figures, but gave no details.
Typhoon Vamco passed north of Manila between Bulacan and Pampanga provinces, toppling trees and knocking out power. Officials said earlier that nearly 200,000 people had been evacuated, some forcibly, from vulnerable coastal and low-lying areas.
Officials said about 1.9 million households were without power in Metro Manila and nearby provinces. Many electricity poles were toppled, power lines were knocked down and power transformers were damaged.
President Rodrigo Duterte took a break from an online summit of Southeast Asian leaders to fly by helicopter over the affected areas.
“As president I guarantee you that your government will do its best to provide assistance in the form of shelters, relief goods, financial aid and post-disaster counseling. Rest assured, the government will not leave anybody behind. We will get through this crisis,” Duterte said in a televised address.
Rescue teams were deployed to flooded areas in Rizal province, coast guard chief Adm. George Ursabia told DZBB radio.
Marikina city Mayor Marcie Teodoro said fierce winds knocked down power lines overnight, leaving many areas without power and internet service. Heavy rains also flooded many areas and the Marikina River was swollen. Many people in Marikina city were waiting to be rescued from roofs.
“There are many areas that historically don’t get flooded but now they are swamped, like city hall,” he told DZBB radio.
Mark Timbal, spokesman for the government’s disaster response agency, said 363 rescue teams had been deployed consisting of 1,000 rescuers with at least 40 rubber boats.
The typhoon had maximum sustained winds of 130 kilometers per hour (80 mph) with stronger gusts Thursday morning. It was moving west-northwest at 30 kph (19 mph) and was headed for the South China Sea.
The government’s main disaster-response agency had pleaded to the media to relay typhoon alerts in northeastern areas devastated by an earlier typhoon, Goni, saying the agency’s messages could not be sent by cellphones due to damaged telecommunications systems.
Goni, one of the strongest typhoons in the world this year, left more than 30 people dead or missing and damaged or destroyed more than 270,000 houses, many in coastal villages. Tens of thousands of people remain displaced.
The Philippines is hit by about 20 typhoons and tropical storms each year. It is located on the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are common, making it one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries."
Typhoon,"Hurricane Iota has made landfall in Nicaragua as a Category 4 storm, with the Central American region bracing for the possibility of catastrophic damage.
Iota crossed into Nicaragua near the town of Haulover, approximately 15 miles south of where Hurricane Eta also struck as a Category 4 on Nov. 3.
Nicaragua, along with Honduras, Guatemala, and southern Belize, which are flanked by the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean, are still trying to recover from the widespread devastation caused by Hurricane Eta, which left tens of thousands homeless.
At the time, Eta was the strongest storm to ever hit Nicaragua in the month of November.
The National Hurricane Center has warned of ""catastrophic winds, life-threatening storm surge, and torrential rainfall"" across Central America from the latest storm.
When it made landfall, Iota had sustained winds of 155 mph _ a Category 4 hurricane, but by 4 a.m. ET, it had lost strength, becoming a Category 2 storm, with winds at 105 mph, according to the U.S.-based National Hurricane Center. The storm was centered about 10 miles east-northeast of El Pia, Nicaragua. Before making landfall, Iota reached Category 5 for a time.
Besides Iota's incredible strong winds — expected to rip apart roofs and shatter some buildings completely — it is also bringing a massive storm surge, rain and flooding. Water is always the biggest killer in any tropical event and this will be no exception; Iota is a ""bigger"" storm than Eta in terms of how wide the windfield is. That means more people will feel the effects of the storm."
drought,"""Delivering the right response for the millions affected across this region is an important test of our ability to collaborate across borders, institutional and sectoral boundaries"", says Deputy Humanitarian Chief.
The impact of the current El Niño is felt globally, affecting over 60 million people. Southern Africa is of particular concern as the region is facing its worst drought in 35 years, with an estimated 40 million people facing food insecurity, including some 23 million in need of urgent humanitarian assistance. 
Five countries – Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe – have already declared national emergencies, in addition to eight out of nine provinces in South Africa that collectively account for 90 per cent of the country’s maize production. Mozambique has also issued an institutional red alert for its most affected central and southern provinces. While the current diminished harvest provides some temporary respite, the lean season will start earlier than normal and food insecurity is expected to peak between October 2016 and March 2017. The time is now to scale-up the humanitarian response and preserve development gains.
In addition, there is a high probability of La Niña phenomenon toward the end of this year, which is likely to exacerbate the humanitarian situation, as coping capacity has been eroded. Contingency plans need to incorporate the possibility of localized flooding, and due to the reduced capacity of vulnerable farmers to access inputs, there is a need for interventions now that enable people to capitalize on potentially good rains. The aggregated scale of need in the region is on a par with the drought in Ethiopia and there needs to be a commensurate response from international donors in support of the Southern Africa region.
Co-hosted by DFID and OCHA, the focus of this conference was to raise the profile of the impacts of El Niño and La Niña in Southern Africa, to better understand the severe impacts of the crisis at local, national and regional levels, and discuss how donors and partners can come together to provide a coordinated and rapid response. DFID has already responded by scaling up response in countries where they have a presence. UN agencies and partners have also geared up to increase response and promote the visibility of the crisis. This has included the appointment of two special envoys on El Niño and Climate, Ms. Mary Robinson and Ambassador Macharia Kamau. However, more needs to be done and we have a narrowing window of opportunity to reduce mortality, alleviate suffering and enable early recovery."
drought,"At least 200 elephants have died in Zimbabwe’s largest national park amid a severe drought.
Since October, the giant creatures have been found in Hwange National Park, although other parks have also been affected by the drought.?
Other species including giraffes, buffalos and impalas are also dying and the situation will only improve once rain returns, said Tinashe Farawo, a spokesperson for Zimbabwe National Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (Zimparks).
“Almost every animal is being affected,” he said. “Of course, elephants are easily noticed during patrols or game drives, but some bird species are seriously affected because they can only breed in certain tree heights and those trees are being knocked down by elephants.”
Many animals are straying from Zimbabwe’s parks into nearby communities in search of food and water.
Zimparks said 33 people have died from conflict with animals this year.
The drought has also taken its toll on crops, leaving more than half of the population in need of food aid.
The agency said it plans to move 600 elephants, two prides of lions and other animals from the Save Valley Conservancy in the south east of the country to less congested parks.
A pack of wild dogs, 50 buffalos, 40 giraffes and 2,000 impalas will also be relocated, Mr Farawo said."
other,"The year 2004 was marked by continued expansion in economic activity and appreciable gains in employment. With fiscal policy stimulative, monetary policy accommodative, and financial conditions favorable, household spending remained buoyant and businesses increased investment in capital equipment and inventories, despite the restraint imposed by sizable increases in oil prices. Labor market conditions improved significantly, albeit at an uneven pace, and productivity rose notably further. Consumer price inflation moved higher with the surge in energy prices, but core consumer price inflation (that is, excluding food and energy) remained well contained, and measures of expected inflation over longer horizons held steady or edged lower."
other,"The abrupt and significant retreat of inflation in April from the firming trajectory that was developing in February and March has raised several issues that have to be factored into the inflation projections. First, it needs to be assessed as to whether or not the unusually low momentum in the reading for April will endure. Second, the prices of pulses are clearly reeling under the impact of a supply glut caused by record output and imports. Policy interventions, including access to open trade, may be envisaged to arrest the slump in prices. Third, the accumulated downward adjustment in the prices of petrol and diesel effected in April has been largely reversed on June 1. Fourth, the easing of inflation excluding food and fuel may be transient in view of its underlying stickiness in a situation of rising rural wage growth and strong consumption demand. Thus, the April reading has imparted considerable uncertainty to the evolving inflation trajectory, especially for the near months. If the configurations evident in April are sustained, then absent policy interventions, headline inflation is projected in the range of 2.0-3.5 per cent in the first half of the year and 3.5-4.5 per cent in the second half (Chart 1). Risks are evenly balanced, although the spatial and temporal distribution of the monsoon and the government staying the course in effective food management will play a critical role in the evolution of risks. The risk of fiscal slippages, which, by and large, can entail inflationary spillovers, has risen with the announcements of large farm loan waivers. At the current juncture, global political and financial risks materialising into imported inflation and the disbursement of allowances under the 7th central pay commission¡¯s award are upside risks. The date of implementation of the latter is still not announced and as such, it is not factored into the baseline projections. The implementation of the GST is not expected to have a material impact on overall inflation.With the CSO¡¯s provisional estimates for 2016-17, the projection of real GVA growth for 2017-18 has accordingly been revised 10 bps downwards from the April 2017 projection to 7.3 per cent, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2). The continuing remonetisation should enable a pick-up in discretionary consumer spending, especially in cash-intensive segments of the economy. Furthermore, the reductions in banks¡¯ lending rates post-demonetisation should support both consumption and investment demand of households and stress-free corporates. Moreover, Government spending continues to be robust, cushioning the impact of a slowdown in other constituents. The implementation of proposals in the Union Budget should crowd in private investment as the business environment improves with structural reforms, including the GST, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, and the abolition of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board. Strengthening external demand will likely play a more decisive role in supporting the domestic economy. In addition, the new IIP broadens the recognition of industrial activity. On the downside, global political risks remain elevated and could materialise. Second, rising input costs and wage pressures may prove a drag on the profitability of firms, pulling down overall GVA growth. Third, the twin balance sheet problem - over-leveraged corporate sector and stressed banking sector - may delay the revival in private investment demand."
earthquake,"Brief tsunami warning as 7.8 quake hits off Alaska: USGS WASHINGTON (AFP) - A 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck off the Alaskan peninsula, triggering a brief tsunami warning for areas within 300km of the epicentre. Sirens blared as residents were warned to move inland or to higher ground, reports said. The shallow quake hit at 0612 GMT Wednesday about 800km south-west of Anchorage, and around 96km south-southeast of the remote settlement of Perryville, the US Geological Survey said. ""Based on the preliminary earthquake parameters ... hazardous tsunami waves are possible for coasts located within 300km of the earthquake epicentre,"" the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre said. A tsunami warning for the Alaskan peninsula and south Alaska was later cancelled after only small waves were recorded. Warning sirens were sounded in Kodiak, the main city on Kodiak island, and several thousand people were evacuating lower lying areas, Sergeant Daniel Blizzard, with the Alaska State Troopers, told 11 KTVA News.  ""People are pretty concerned especially with an earthquake that big that close to Kodiak,"" he said. ""The last one, there was no wave whatsoever. This time, we’re not sure there is a wave, but we are preparing like there is one,"" Sergeant Blizzard said.  The first place predicted to see a tsunami wave, Sandy Point, had so far reported only ""a very small wave,"" Mr James Gridley, director of National Tsunami Warning Centre in Palmer, told Alaska Public Media (APM).  ""We’re not expecting a massive wave anywhere,"" he said. The quake however, was felt hundreds of kilometres away. ""Bed and curtains were going. Felt like a very long quake!"" one witness in Homer, Alaska, 643km from the epicentre, said on the quake monitoring website msc-csem.org. It was followed by several aftershocks, the strongest measuring 5.7. There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties.  The tremor appeared to be a subduction zone quake, where two tectonic plates converge, a seismologist said."
other,"Inflation in Australia has remained high in the recent period against a background of tight capacity and earlier strong growth in demand. In these circumstances, the Board has been seeking to restrain demand in order to reduce inflation over time.Recent indications are that a significant moderation in domestic demand is now occurring. In addition to the effects of tighter financial conditions, other factors including a slowing in global growth, declining asset markets and higher fuel costs are acting to restrain domestic spending and activity. At the same time, high global commodity prices are adding to Australia's terms of trade, and this is providing a significant countervailing influence. Prospects for growth of the Australian economy and for inflation will continue to depend on the net effects flowing from these opposing forces.
"
other,"The challenges to achieving this overarching goal are many. Not only are economies frequently buffeted by shocks (such as oil price jumps), but some economists believe that natural cycles in the economy also exist. Moreover, there are plenty of examples from history where government policies¡ªeither monetary, fiscal, or both¡ªhave exacerbated an economic expansion that eventually led to damaging consequences for the real economy, for financial markets, and for investors.The balance of the reading is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an introduction to monetary policy and related topics. Section 3 presents fiscal policy. The interactions between monetary policy and fiscal policy are the subject of Section 4. A summary and practice problems conclude the reading."

Thousands were evacuated from some coastal areas of the North Island after the third, 8.1-magnitude quake struck.
There were reports of traffic gridlock as people tried to reach higher ground.
The national tsunami warning was lifted at 15:43 (02:43 GMT), some 13 hours after the first quake.
Some wave surges hit parts of the coast but, by Friday afternoon, authorities said the largest waves had passed. Residents were told they could return home but were warned to stay off beaches."

More than 2,000 people have been evacuated, with elderly residents carried on to ferries.
Local officials said more help was needed to fight the fires that have destroyed parts of the island.
The EU said it was mobilising one of its biggest responses to tackle the wildfires affecting Greece and a number of other European nations.
Greece and neighbouring Turkey have been battling devastating blazes for nearly two weeks as the region suffers its worst heatwave in decades. Temperatures have risen to 45C (113F) in Greece.
A number of wildfires have struck the country in recent days. One blaze in the northern suburb of Athens is said to have subsided.
Heatwaves such as this are becoming more likely and more extreme because of human-induced climate change. The subsequent hot, dry weather is likely to fuel wildfires.
On Evia, a large island to the north and east of Athens, two fire fronts have destroyed thousands of hectares of land, along with a number of houses and businesses."
drought,"At least 330 million people are affected by drought in India, the government has told the Supreme Court
Authorities say this number is likely to rise further given that some states with water shortages have not yet submitted status reports.
The drought is taking place as a heat wave extends across much of India with temperatures crossing 40C for days now.
An 11-year-old girl died of heatstroke while collecting water from a village pump in the western Maharashtra state.
Yogita Desai had spent close to four hours in 42C temperatures gathering water from the pump on Sunday, local journalist Manoj Sapte told the BBC.
She began vomiting after returning home and was rushed to hospital, but died early on Monday.
Yogita's death certificate says she died of heatstroke and dehydration.
The pump was a mere 500m from her house, but a typical wait for water stretches into hours.
India is heavily dependant on monsoon rains, which have been poor for two years in a row.
The government said that nearly 256 districts across India, home to nearly a quarter of the population were impacted by the drought.
Schools have been shut in the eastern state of Orissa and more than 100 deaths due to heatstroke have been reported from across the country, including from the southern states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh which saw more than 2,000 deaths last summer."
other,"Inflation has eased in Q2:2018-19 on an unusual ebbing in the momentum of food prices, after rising strongly in Q1 on the back of surging prices of non-food items (including the impact of 7th CPC¡¯s HRA increase) across categories. Input costs rose sharply in Q1 and remained firm in Q2, largely due to increase in fuel prices. Wage pressures remained contained in both rural and organised sectors.Over the first half of 2018-19, the course of consumer price index (CPI) inflation has been shaped by diverse pulls. Within major groups, while food inflation remained soft in Q1:2018-19, and declined sharply in July and August 2018, fuel and light inflation rose noticeably, tracking international prices. Inflation in CPI excluding food and fuel also firmed up in Q1:2018-19 and remained elevated through July- August, notwithstanding some softening. The impact of the increase in house rent allowances (HRA) for central government employees on headline inflation has started to ebb from July.1 Adjusting for the HRA impact, headline inflation in August was estimated at 3.4 per cent as against the print of 3.7 per cent and inflation in CPI excluding food and fuel was estimated at 5.4 per cent against the reading of 6.0 percent (Chart II.1).The MPR of April 2018 had projected CPI inflation to increase from 4.6 per cent observed in Q4:2017-18 to 5.1 per cent in Q1:2018-19 and then moderate to 4.7 per cent in Q2. Excluding the estimated impact of HRA, CPI inflation was projected at 4.7 per cent in Q1 and then moderate to 4.4 per cent in Q2. Actual inflation outcomes have tracked these projections directionally; in terms of magnitude, however, inflation undershot projections by a considerable margin _ 28 basis points (bps) in Q1 and 74 bps in Q2 up to August (Chart II.2) _ entirely on account of a surprising persistence in the softening of prices of fruits, particularly in Q2, and lower than usual hardening in prices of vegetables in the summer months. Food inflation fell from 3.7 per cent in Q4:2017-18 to 3.1 per cent in Q1:2018-19. This is a significant development because it occurred on a base which reflected the after effects of demonetisation in depressing prices of fruits and vegetables in Q1 a year ago. Subsequently, food inflation plunged further to 1.3 per cent in July-August as strong favourable base effects coincided with inexplicable weak momentum of food prices. In fact, ebbing food inflation more than offset the impact of higher than projected crude oil prices _ US$ 73.5 per barrel, on an average, during H1:2018-19 vis-¨¤-vis the baseline assumption of US$ 68 per barrel in April 2018."
earthquake,"Magnitude 6.8 earthquake jolts northern Japan A 6.8 magnitude earthquake that also measured a strong 5 on the shindo (intensity) scale struck off Japan’s northeastern coast on Saturday but no tsunami warning was issued, Japanese and U.S. authorities said, with no immediate reports of damage. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) said the midmorning quake hit at a depth of 47 kilometers (29 miles) in the Pacific, off Ishinomaki, Miyagi prefecture, near the epicenter of the huge March 2011 quake that triggered a towering tsunami, killing more than 18,000 people. The USGS and Meteorological Agency said there was no tsunami risk following the jolt, which produced strong shaking along parts of the eastern coast and was also felt in Tokyo. Officials in Aomori, Fukushima and Iwate said no casualties had been reported and public broadcaster NHK said there were no immediate reports of damage. But a Meteorological Agency official warned strong aftershocks may hit the region in about a week, adding that expected bad weather may trigger landslides following the latest ground shaking. Two people were slightly injured after windows were broken at a station in Onagawa, Miyagi, NHK said. “We are aware of the news but still collecting information,” said Kazuto Takeda, an official with the prefecture’s disaster management office. NHK also said a woman in her 80s was treated in hospital after she fell at a supermarket in Fukushima. Some sections of expressways and train services, including those on the Tohoku Shinkansen Line, were suspended following the temblor, which was also felt in Tokyo. Tokyo Electric Power Co. Holdings is checking for any irregularities at its nuclear power plant in Fukushima, according to NHK. Tohoku Electric Power Co. found no abnormalities at its Onagawa, Higashidori nuclear plants, according to a spokesperson. Saturday marked the first day of a five-day holiday and a number of people were seen evacuating from JR Sendai Station, with university student Asuka Koike, who was on her way to her hometown in Fukushima Prefecture, saying, “I don’t know what to do.

drought,"The United Nations refugee agency said today that with the increasing gravity of the situation in Somalia, where hundreds of thousands of people are suffering because of drought and conflict, it was stepping up assistance with aid distributions across the country’s central and southern parts.
Adrian Edwards, a spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), told a news briefing in Geneva that “although access remains a serious impediment, working with partners on the ground in Somalia we have so far distributed assistance packages to some 90,000 people in Mogadishu and Belet Hawa and Dobley in southwest Somalia.”
The agency is handing out non-food aid for an estimated 126,000 people in other parts of the Gedo and Lower Juba region to the west, with assistance also on its way to Mogadishu and the Afgooye corridor just west of Mogadishu, as well as further southwest in the Lower Shabelle area, Mr. Edwards said.
The agency is strengthening its mechanisms for tracking population movement and protection monitoring in the corridors leading to the Dolo Ado and Dadaab refugee camps in Ethiopia and Kenya respectively.
“Our aim is that through shorter interval reporting we’ll be better able to inform emergency interventions,” Mr. Edwards said. “UNHCR is the primary provider of this information to UN agencies and NGOs operating in Somalia.”
“Given the very serious health state of many refugees arriving at camps in neighbouring countries, UNHCR believes it is of life-saving importance that people in Somalia are able to get help where they need it,” he said. “This may, in certain circumstances, mitigate the necessity to cross borders into neighbouring countries, where refugee camps were already bursting at the seams.”
UNHCR continues to look at all means to step up its efforts inside the country, he said."
wildfires,"Authorities in Alaska are reporting an unusually high number of wildfires burning simultaneously across the tundra and forests of the state, and an exceptionally large number of homes and buildings have been damaged or threatened by the flames so far this year.Wildfires are a common occurrence in Alaska, but this year’s fires started earlier than normal and have escalated quickly. A light winter snowpack and little rain in the spring left dry ground particularly vulnerable to fires that break out when lightning strikes, said Tim Mowry, a public information officer with the Alaska Division of Forestry.
The total area affected by the fires—roughly 624,000 acres—is not exceptional, but it is spread out over a larger number of separate fires burning in different areas, Mowry said.
The state has seen 562 fires so far this year, and the bulk of those started recently and at around the same time."
other,"In its April 2020 Monetary Policy Statement (MPS), MAS set the rate of appreciation of the S$NEER policy band at zero percent per annum, starting at the then-prevailing level of the S$NEER. There was no change to the width of the policy band. This policy stance was assessed to be appropriate given the deterioration in economic conditions and weaker inflation outlook, and aimed to complement fiscal, liquidity and financial policies in supporting the economy through the COVID-19 downturn.The S$NEER had fallen sharply in Q1 2020. Since the MPS on 30 March, it has hovered slightly above the mid-point of the new policy band. The relative stability of the S$NEER has reflected the strengthening of the S$ against the US$, offset by its weakening against a number of regional currencies. The three-month S$ SIBOR fell from 1.0% at end-March to 0.4% in early October, alongside the decline in the US$ LIBOR."
earthquake,"Nine dead in Turkey as 5.7 earthquake strikes western Iran Turkey's health minister says nine people were killed by a magnitude 5.7 earthquake in the country's east ANKARA, Turkey -- Nine people were killed in eastern Turkey by a magnitude 5.7 earthquake early Sunday morning, Turkish Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said. The quake centered just east across the border in neighboring Iran, west of the Iranian city of Khoy, and affected villages in the Turkish province of Van. At least three of the dead were children, according to Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu. The health minister later said at least 37 people were injured, including nine in critical but not life-threatening condition. Iran’s official IRNA news agency said at least 75 people had been injured inside Iran, six of whom were hospitalized. A second earthquake — also magnitude 5.7 — struck Sunday evening in the same area in Iran, according to the country's seismology center. It was not immediately clear if the second quake caused further damage or casualties in either country. The U.S. Geological Survey put the second earthquake’s magnitude at 6.0. Varying magnitudes are common in the immediate aftermath. Turkish broadcaster NTV showed images of locals and soldiers digging through the rubble of collapsed buildings on Sunday, as families sat in snowy streets fearing further tremors. Emergency teams were sent to the remote mountainous region, which has a history of powerful earthquakes. Last month, a quake centered on the eastern Turkish city of Elazig killed more than 40 people. In 2011, more than 600 were killed when a quake struck north of Van province's capital."
wildfires,"Nearly 3 billion animals were affected by Australia's worst wildfire season that burned from last July through March, scientists announced Tuesday — a figure almost three times higher than original estimates.
The report released Tuesday and commissioned by the World Wide Fund for Nature Australia said more than 46 million acres were scorched. An estimate in January said 1.25 billion animals were affected.
""This ranks as one of the worst wildlife disasters in modern history,” Dermot O’Gorman, the organization's chief executive officer, said in a statement. ""It’s hard to think of another event anywhere in the world in living memory that has killed or displaced that many animals.""
Ten researchers from Australian universities and wildlife groups involved in the report have been looking at both the impact of the fires and the possible ways to protect ecosystems in the future.
The affected wildlife includes 143 million mammals, 2.46 billion reptiles, 180 million birds and 51 million frogs.
""It's almost impossible to comprehend how many individuals that actually means,"" Lily van Eeden, a researcher at the University of Sydney and a co-author of the report, told NBC News.
The jump in the estimated animals affected compared to the January report is due to a wider geographic area being studied and new data on wildlife, she said.
Despite the increased scope of the research, Van Eeden cautioned, the estimate is still ""quite conservative.""
Invertebrate species — such as spiders and butterflies — were not included and neither was a range of wildlife that lives in waterways like turtles."
other,"Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I am pleased this morning to present the Federal Reserve's semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress. I will begin by reviewing the state of the U.S. economy and the conduct of monetary policy and then turn to some key issues related to the federal budget.When I testified before this committee last July, I noted that, while the growth of economic activity over the first half of the year had been spurred importantly by a swing from rapid inventory drawdown to modest inventory accumulation, that source of impetus would surely wind down in subsequent quarters, as it did. We at the Federal Reserve recognized that a strengthening of final sales was an essential element of putting the expansion on a firm and sustainable track. To support such a strengthening, monetary policy was set to continue its accommodative stance.In the event, final sales continued to grow only modestly, and business outlays remained soft. Concerns about corporate governance, which intensified for a time, were compounded over the late summer and into the fall by growing geopolitical tensions. In particular, worries about the situation in Iraq contributed to an appreciable increase in oil prices. These uncertainties, coupled with ongoing concerns surrounding macroeconomic prospects, heightened investors' perception of risk and, perhaps, their aversion to such risk. Equity prices weakened further, the expected volatility of equity prices rose to unusually high levels, spreads on corporate debt and credit default swaps deteriorated, and liquidity in corporate debt markets declined. The economic data and the anecdotal information suggested that firms were tightly limiting hiring and capital spending and keeping an unusually short leash on inventories. With capital markets inhospitable and commercial banks firming terms and standards on business loans, corporations relied to an unusual extent on a drawdown of their liquid assets rather than on borrowing to fund their limited expenditures."
wildfires,"Just before the COVID-19 pandemic, bush fires in Australia destroyed more than 3,000 homes and burnt millions of hectares of vegetation. The crisis exposed the nation’s fire monitoring system as being unfit for purpose. Precise real-time information about the area burnt and the intensity of the fires was not available when it was needed.
Australia does not have a central system for gathering and storing essential information about bush fires. State and territory governments, and even agencies within states, have different approaches. This worked fine when fires were smaller. But those in the 2019_20 season crossed multiple state borders.
The blazes engulfed a huge geographic range and burnt for a duration and intensity that was beyond the experience of communities and fire managers1. Many Australians endured five months of smoke pollution that breached national air-quality standards. Usually, people would experience shorter bouts covering smaller areas2.
The extraordinary scale and intensity of the fires were driven by climate conditions not seen in a century: three years of drought, including three consecutive, anomalously dry winters3. This weather is consistent with predictions that global warming will result in conditions that increase the risk of fire4,5. Studies have linked extreme bush-fire seasons over the past few years to anthropogenic climate change
Debate over the cause of the bush fires became politically charged. Fire scientists and managers had to stem misinformation from politicians and the media suggesting that the fires were not unusual historically and were not linked to climate change. There were even suggestions that the fires were the result of arson, or of inappropriate land management8_10. Staggering environmental consequences were claimed, including greenhouse-gas emissions that were exceeded only by those in China, the United States, India, Russia and Japan, and the loss or displacement of more than one billion native vertebrates."
other,"In the services sector, construction activity is weakening as reflected in low demand for cement and the large inventory of unsold residential houses in some localities. Rising public expenditure on roads, ports and eventually railways could, however, provide some boost to construction going forward. Lead indicators relating to freight and passenger traffic are mixed. In August, the services PMI remained in expansion for the second consecutive month on improving new business, but business expectations remain subdued.Headline consumer price index (CPI) inflation reached its lowest level in August since November 2014. The ebbing of inflation in the year so far is due to a combination of low month-on-month increases in prices and favourable base effects. Overall year-on-year food inflation dropped sharply, led by vegetables and sugar. Cereal inflation moderated steadily during April-August, but price pressures in respect of pulses and onions remained elevated.CPI inflation excluding food and fuel eased in August for the second consecutive month, primarily due to the decline in petrol and diesel prices pulling down inflation in transportation. Fares other than for air transport have, however, remained inflexible downwards. Inflation in house rentals increased, but was more than offset by some moderation in the heterogeneous category of services, including education, personal care and effects, and health. Inflation expectations of households remained elevated in double digits likely in response to recent month-on-month increases in the prices of vegetables and pulses. Professional forecasters¡¯ inflation expectations eased as credibility built around the January 2016 inflation target. Rural wage growth remains subdued and corporate staff costs decelerated.Liquidity conditions eased considerably during August to mid-September. In addition to structural factors such as deposit mobilisation in excess of credit flow, lower currency demand and pick-up in spending by the government contributed to the surplus liquidity. In response, the Reserve Bank conducted variable rate reverse repos of overnight and longer tenors ranging from 2 to 20 days. As a result, the average net daily liquidity absorption by the Reserve Bank increased from _120 billion in July to _261 billion in August and further to _544 billion in September (up to September 15). Money market rates generally remained below the repo rate. As quarterly tax collections went out of the system from mid-September, deficit conditions returned and the Reserve Bank engaged in average net injections of the order of _544 billion (September 16 to 27), keeping the call money rate close to the repo rate. Some forms of bank credit such as personal loans grew strongly as did non-bank financing flows through commercial paper, public equity issues and housing finance. With the weakening of growth prospects in EMEs and world trade volume growth falling below world GDP growth, India¡¯s merchandise exports continued to decline in the first two months of Q2. Imports values also declined, but the sharp fall in international crude oil and gold prices was offset by rising import volumes. Non-oil non-gold imports went back into contraction after recording a marginal pick-up in the previous quarter, although there were higher imports of fertilisers, electronics and pulses. With services exports moderating, the widening of the merchandise trade deficit could lead to a modest increase in the current account deficit (CAD) during Q2. Net capital inflows were buoyed by sustained foreign direct investment and accretion to non-resident deposits, and reduced by portfolio outflows, mainly from equity markets. Foreign exchange reserves rose by US $ 10.4 billion during the first half of 2015-16."
earthquake,"_zmir/Turkey: Earthquake Situation Report No: 03, 31 October 2020 Background A magnitude 6.6 earthquake struck the western province of Izmir, Turkey on Friday, October 30, 2:51 pm local time. The European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre said the quake had an epicentre 13 km northeast of the Greek island of Samos. The earthquake was felt in provinces as far as Istanbul, Bodrum, Mu_la, and Manisa. Soon after the initial quake, the Province was shaken further by 389 aftershocks, with 33 of them more powerful than magnitude 4.0. The quake has left severe damage to the structures and infrastructures in different areas of Bornova and Bayrakl_ regions of the city, pushing the residents to flee in panic into the streets. At least 17 buildings have been reported collapsed and several others damaged."
valcano eruption,"White Island volcano: what we know about the victims The 47 people caught in the blast came from seven different countries. There are 16 confirmed fatalities, with many of the injured still in critical condition There are 16 confirmed victims of the fatal eruption on White Island/Whakaari _ 12 Australians, two Australian permanent residents, one American and one New Zealander. Two people _ Australian teenager Winona Langford and New Zealand guide Hayden Marshall-Inman, 40 _ are still missing despite repeated ground and sea searches. Their bodies are believed to be in the water, police have said. There were 47 people on the island at the time of the eruption, 38 of them from the cruise liner Ovation of the Seas. Those present comprised of 24 people from Australia, nine from the US, two Britons, four Germans, five New Zealanders, two people from China and one from Malaysia. As of Tuesday, there were 14 patients being cared for in four burns units around New Zealand. In the days after the blast, 13 Australians were repatriated to hospitals in their home country, one of whom was confirmed by police to have died at Concord hospital in Sydney. The Australian man’s name was not released at the request of the family."
other,"Going forward, the revival of south-west monsoon and the pick-up in kharif sowing, buffered by adequate food stocks should help to control cereal price pressures. High frequency indicators suggest some softening of price pressures in edible oils and pulses in July in response to supply side interventions by the Government. Input prices are rising across manufacturing and services sectors, but weak demand and efforts towards cost cutting are tempering the pass-through to output prices. With crude oil prices at elevated levels, a calibrated reduction of the indirect tax component of pump prices by the Centre and states can help to substantially lessen cost pressures. Taking into consideration all these factors, CPI inflation is now projected at 5.7 per cent during 2021-22: 5.9 per cent in Q2; 5.3 per cent in Q3; and 5.8 per cent in Q4 of 2021-22, with risks broadly balanced. CPI inflation for Q1:2022-23 is projected at 5.1 per cent (Chart 1).Domestic economic activity is starting to recover with the ebbing of the second wave. Looking ahead, agricultural production and rural demand are expected to remain resilient. Urban demand is likely to mend with a lag as manufacturing and non-contact intensive services resume on a stronger pace, and the release of pent-up demand acquires a durable character with an accelerated pace of vaccination. Buoyant exports, the expected pick-up in government expenditure, including capital expenditure, and the recent economic package announced by the Government will provide further impetus to aggregate demand. Although investment demand is still anaemic, improving capacity utilisation and congenial monetary and financial conditions are preparing the ground for a long-awaited revival. Firms polled in the Reserve Bank surveys expect expansion in production volumes and new orders in Q2:2021-22, which is likely to sustain through Q4. Elevated levels of global commodity prices and financial market volatility are, however, the main downside risks. Taking all these factors into consideration, projection for real GDP growth is retained at 9.5 per cent in 2021-22 consisting of 21.4 per cent in Q1; 7.3 per cent in Q2; 6.3 per cent in Q3; and 6.1 per cent in Q4 of 2021-22. Real GDP growth for Q1:2022-23 is projected at 17.2 per cent (Chart 2).Inflationary pressures are being closely and continuously monitored. The MPC is conscious of its objective of anchoring inflation expectations. The outlook for aggregate demand is improving, but still weak and overcast by the pandemic. There is a large amount of slack in the economy, with output below its pre-pandemic level. The current assessment is that the inflationary pressures during Q1:2021-22 are largely driven by adverse supply shocks which are expected to be transitory. While the Government has taken certain steps to ease supply constraints, concerted efforts in this direction are necessary to restore supply-demand balance. The nascent and hesitant recovery needs to be nurtured through fiscal, monetary and sectoral policy levers. Accordingly, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 4 per cent and continue with an accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward."

The contribution will go towards providing immediate food and non-food relief items, water purification units, and disaster prevention interventions. It will also help finance short-term recovery projects such as the rehabilitation of latrines, and livelihood support for those affected.  The Singapore Red Cross is not launching a public appeal for funds at this time, though those interested in doing so can make an online transfer."

other,"Monetary policy was eased in 2019 to support employment and income growth and to provide greater confidence that inflation will be consistent with the medium-term target. This policy response is supporting the overall growth outlook through a number of channels. The Australian dollar is lower than it otherwise would be as a result of the policy easing; it is now around the bottom of its range in recent years. Interest rates faced by both borrowers and lenders are now at very low levels. The lower interest rates have contributed to increased demand for both new and existing homes. They also lower required debt payments for many households. The resulting extra cash flows can be spent or used to pay down debt faster, although this benefit is partly offset by reduced interest income for savers. The effects of the recent rate reductions take time to work their way through the economy and have their full impact on spending. Some of the early stage channels of policy transmission, such as new borrowing, higher asset prices and a depreciation of the exchange rate, are nonetheless proceeding as normal.The low level of interest rates in Australia reflect the low interest rates globally as well as the only gradual progress towards the Bank's goals, as the Australian economy navigates a period of slow growth. This soft patch in growth is likely to extend into early 2020 because of the ongoing drought, the effects of the bushfires, and the effects on Australian exports of the recent outbreak of a new coronavirus in China. Beyond these shorter-term effects, the medium-term outlook for the Australian economy is broadly unchanged from three months ago."

drought,"""We normally experience three or four months of drought,"" says the 59-year-old. ""But the last drop that fell here was last July.”
Experts say the water situation in East Africa is the worst the continent has seen since 2011, when a famine-inducing drought killed as many as 260,000 people in Somalia, Kenya and other parts of East Africa. According to UNICEF, 2.6 million Kenyans have become food insecure as a result of the lack of rainfall. The Kenya Red Cross reported at the beginning of this year that 5 percent of livestock in some areas of Kenya have died since the drought began last year.
Livestock accounts for an estimated 12 percent of Kenya's gross domestic product and more than 40 percent of its agricultural sector. The mass deaths of the animals are threatening the livelihoods of Kenyan pastoralists like Kwopin, who inhabit the arid and semi-arid lands that comprise 80 percent of the country. In times of drought, they must roam farther in search of grass over which they must compete with people from neighboring tribes.
Some pastoralists have resorted to cattle stealing to recoup their losses – at times through violence. The only solution to the insecurity, some experts say, may be for herders to change their long-held customs by planting and maintaining grass of their own for sustainable grazing."

The recovery is most advanced in Asia, although almost all economies are now growing again, albeit weakly in some cases. International trade is also continuing to recover and a degree of stability has returned to financial markets.This is a much better environment than was feared likely in the early part of last year and forecasts for global growth have been revised up accordingly. The world economy is now widely expected to grow by around 4 per cent in each of the next couple of years. This is around the average pace of growth over the past decade or so, although it would represent only a relatively mild recovery from what has been a severe global downturn. The recovery in the advanced economies is likely to remain subdued for some time, with these economies continuing to operate with considerable excess capacity. In contrast, relatively strong growth is expected in the Asian region."
flood,"Vietnam: Floods Emergency Plan of Action (EPoA) DREF Operation n° MDRVN020 The central region of Vietnam has been experiencing prolonged heavy rain since 6 October 2020. This is due to the combination of numerous weather systems – the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone combining with cold air as well as tropical storms Linfa and Nangka. Tropical Storm Linfa made landfall in Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces in Central Vietnam in the morning of 11 October 2020 and brought along 150 to 300 millimeters of rain. Tropical Storm Nangka made landfall in the morning of 14 October 2020 in the northern provinces of Vietnam which brought along a further 150 millimeters of rain. On 16 October 2020, another tropical depression (Tropical Depression INVEST 94W) made landfall in the central provinces of Vietnam. The tropical depression had weakened into a low-pressure area and dissipated after landfall. As of 19 October 2020, only about 25,000 people continue to stay in evacuation places set up by local authorities mostly in Quang Binh province. In the other provinces, where flood waters have receded, people have returned to their homes with rehabilitation now underway. According to the initial needs assessment and report from the NCDPC, at least 712 houses were destroyed while 170,000 were inundated. The constant heavy rain due to the combination of these weather systems had caused water levels in rivers to rise rapidly. Consequently, large-scale floods appeared in the provinces from Ha Tinh to Quang Ngai province, with major floods concentrated in places from Quang Binh to Quang Nam province. Flood on medium and small rivers in Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue provinces all reached alert Level 2 or 3 and even above Level 3. Particularly, historical floods occurred on Hieu River (Quang Tri province) and Bo river (Thua Thien Hue province). In certain areas, it was reported that the flood waters had exceeded the previous historical high recorded in 1999. Click here to see the map of affected areas. Close to a million people have been severely affected by flooding in central Vietnam. At least 55 people lives have been lost due to the floods.

Such ECBs could be availed from all eligible lenders under the extant ECB framework except from overseas branches/subsidiaries of Indian banks. Guidelines in this regard will be issued by the end of February 2019.The structure, size, lack of avenues for raising capital funds and limited area of operation of the Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks (UCBs) add to their financial vulnerabilities. A long-term solution to make the UCB sector financially resilient and to enhance the depositors¡¯ confidence is to set up an Umbrella Organization (UO) as prevalent in many countries. The UO, apart from extending liquidity and capital support to its member UCBs, would also be expected to set up Information and Technology (IT) infrastructure for shared use of members to enable them to widen their range of services in the wake of advances in information and communication technology at a relatively lower cost. The UO can also offer fund management and other consultancy services.The idea of setting up of UO for the UCB sector was first mooted in the year 2006 by the Working Group (Chairman: Shri N S Vishwanathan) set up by the Reserve Bank on Augmentation of Capital of UCBs.

wildfires,"A fast-moving wildfire that broke out on Thursday on the outskirts of a National Forest in Northern California has prompted the evacuation of a community college, a major highway and some residents, officials said.
The Mountain Fire, which erupted about noon PDT just north of the town of Bella Vista in Shasta County, had raced across some 600 acres (240 hectares) within a few hours, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said on its incident website.
Photos of the blaze posted on Twitter by the Shasta County Sheriff's Office showed thick black and grey smoke billowing into the area over a highway near the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. There was no containment of the flames.
""Jones Valley and Bella Vista area residents! This situation is very fluid and rapidly changing, if you do not see your road listed but feel you are in danger YOU MAY EVACUATE to Shasta College Gymnasium,"" the sheriff's department said in a separate tweet.
The Shasta College campus was closed along with Highway 299 and about a dozen smaller roads. Residents of small communities in the path of the flames were told to evacuate or be prepared to flee on short notice.

Systemic liquidity moved back into surplus mode in early July with increased government spending but turned into deficit from July 10 onwards; on a daily net average basis, the Reserve Bank injected liquidity under the LAF of _ 107 billion in July. The WACR in July, on an average, traded 9 basis points below the policy rate. Based on an assessment of prevailing liquidity conditions and of durable liquidity needs going forward, the Reserve Bank conducted two open market operation (OMO) purchase auctions of _ 100 billion each on June 21 and July 19, 2018.Export growth picked up in May and June 2018 on a y-o-y basis, aided by engineering goods, petroleum products, drugs and pharmaceuticals, and chemicals. Import growth also accelerated largely due to an increase in crude oil prices. Among non-oil imports, gold imports declined due to lower volume, while imports of machinery, coal, electronic goods, chemicals, and iron and steel increased sharply. Double-digit import growth in May and June pushed up the trade deficit. On the financing side, net foreign direct investment (FDI) flows improved significantly in the first two months of 2018-19. With the tightening of liquidity conditions in AEs, growing geopolitical concerns and with the escalation of protectionist sentiment, net foreign portfolio investment (FPI) outflows from the domestic capital market have continued, albeit at an increasingly slower rate. India¡¯s foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 404.2 billion on July 27, 2018."
wildfires,"CAL FIRE says over 4,000 firefighters are battling nine wildfires in California. The fires are stretched across the state from the southern part of the state to the northern areas. 
Butte County's Saddle Fire remains at 850 acres and is now 60 percent contained. Three structures were destroyed in this fire, another 300 were threatened, before crews gained containment. Now 100 structures remain threatened. Area evacuation orders were lifted Wednesday evening. The cause of the fire is still under investigation.
Soberanes Fire that was started in Monterey County caused by an illegal campfire, is burning at 102,499 acres and is 60 percent contained. Soberanes fire has been burning for 49 days. 
Nevada County's Pheonix Fire and San Bernardino's Spring Fire are the most recently started fires. 
CAL FIRE says 95 percent of all wildfires are caused by human activity."
flood,"Central Vietnam: a month in tragedies In just a month, central Vietnam got struck by three floods, four storms and a series of landslides that claimed 159 lives and left 71 missing. On October 4, provinces from Thanh Hoa to Quang Ngai along the central strip of Vietnam recorded heavy rains due to a combination of a cold spell moving down from the north and winds from the east. After months of drought, rains brought joy to the people of central Vietnam. But little did they know the rain in fact signaled a streak of consecutive disasters.  The next day, an intertropical convergence zone was formed, stretching from the Bay of Bengal across central Vietnam to the Philippines.  The zone brought more torrential downpours to the region, flooding many parts over several days. Then, with the convergence of strong winds moving over warm seawater, a tropical depression formed into a storm on the East Sea, also known as the South China Sea.  On October 11, Storm Linfa intensified from a tropical depression and made landfall over Quang Nam and Quang Ngai. A day later, Storm Nangka hit the coast between northern Thai Binh and central Thanh Hoa provinces."
wildfires,"A fast-moving wildfire burning Monday along the Royal Gorge and U.S. 50 west of Ca?on City forced the evacuation of homes, businesses, campgrounds and parks, including Royal Gorge and Buckskin Joe, and destroyed several structures.
“Anybody, whether they’re businesses, whether they’re residences, camping or anything else, everybody has been evacuated from the area,” said Bureau of Land Management spokeswoman Cass Cairns.
By Monday evening, winds with gusts of 20 mph to 30 mph had pushed the fire northeast from the intersection of U.S. 50 and Colorado 9 over 700 acres. Smoke and poor visibility closed U.S. 50 6 miles west of Ca?on City.
The Fremont County Sheriff’s Office called 177 businesses and residents asking them to evacuate. Cairns said it was unclear how many structures had burned or whether any were homes.
Smoke from the fire burning in an area known as Parkdale could be seen and smelled in Colorado Springs on Monday night.
The National Weather Service issued a red flag warning for the region, advising that strong winds and relatively low humidity might cause the fire to spread.
About 50 firefighters were battling the fire on the ground, supported by a fleet of aircraft dropping flame retardant, Cairns said. These included one large air tanker, a single-engine plane, a large helicopter and a smaller helicopter.
Mike Bandera, general manager of the Royal Gorge Bridge, said the historic bridge was not threatened but that homes along Fremont County Road 61 were evacuated.
Bandera said he first saw the flames about 1:30 p.m. Monday, jumping as high as 20 feet into the air.
Overnight, firefighters will continue to monitor the blaze and create fire breaks to minimize the spread. They will fight the fire depending on the direction it is headed, how active it is and on firefighter safety, Cairns said.
Meanwhile, the fire sparked by lightning in the Great Sand Dunes National Park a few weeks ago has engulfed 4,700 acres. Strong winds stoked the blaze.
On the Western Slope, a 170-acre blaze was burning on the Roan Plateau, 10 miles northwest of Rifle.
“It’s a fairly remote, rugged area and not threatening any structures,” said Dave Boyd, spokesman for the Upper Colorado River Interagency Fire Management Unit.
Colorado has about 300 wildfires a year, Boyd said, most of which stay small. A normal fire season is predicted for Colorado this year, Boyd said."
wildfires,"How much do you really know about wildfires in California? The Western U.S. is enduring an unprecedented fire year, and one thing's clear: the fires we face today are different from the fires of the 19th and 20th Centuries.
From public health in the smoke plume to remote-controlled hobby aircraft interfering with firefighting efforts to instant access to information via social media, life in fire country is ever changing.
Here are ten important facts about wildfires in the Golden State. How many did you know?
There are two distinct wildfire seasons in California: ones driven by Santa Ana winds (usually October to April) and ones generally exacerbated by heat in the summer months (usually June to September). Santa Ana fires spread more quickly, while non-Santa Ana fires spread more slowly and are considered less intense, though they can burn longer.
Climate change will probably worsen wildfires, but wildfires can also make climate change worse. When undisturbed, forests and wildlands capture and store millions of tons of carbon from the atmosphere in California; wildfires release carbon back into the atmosphere, exacerbating climate change. An April 2015 study by the National Park Service and UC Berkeley, published in Forest Ecology and Management, showed that five to seven percent of carbon emissions between 2001 and 2010 came from wildfires.
Look forward to more burned-over landscapes in California. A September 2015 paper published in Environmental Research Letters by scientists from the University of California predicts that California land burned by wildfires will increase in the coming decades. By comparing temperature, wind, and relative humidity in the present climate with projections from five different global climate models, they are able to project that area burned by Santa Ana fires will increase by 64 percent; and the area burned by non-Santa Ana fires will increase by 77 percent. Factors that point to this increase: an increase in more intense Santa Ana winds and an increase in temperatures, both due to climate change."

flood,"Tackle Beaufort flood immediately, Sabah minister tells authorities BEAUFORT, May 19 ― Authorities should tackle the flood problem in Beaufort immediately to minimise the losses incurred by the people, said Community Development and People’s Wellbeing Minister Ir Shahelmey Yahya.  He called on responsible parties to rectify the issue which has become an annual event.  “Flooding in Beaufort has become like an annual event. When there is heavy rain in Tenom, overflowing water from Tenom will spill over to Beaufort through the Padas River,” he said. He hoped the relevant departments and agencies in Beaufort will sit together to discuss solutions to the problem."
other,"Retail inflation, measured by the year-on-year change in the CPI, fell from a high of 5.1 per cent in January to 4.4 per cent in February due to a decline in inflation in food and fuel. Excluding the estimated impact of an increase in the house rent allowances (HRA) for central government employees under the 7th central pay commission (CPC), the headline inflation for February was at 4.1 per cent. Food inflation declined by 120 bps in February, pulled down by a sharp decline in vegetable prices, especially of onions and tomatoes, along with continuing deflation in pulses. The fall in prices was also observed in other food components such as eggs, sugar, meat and fish, oils, spices, cereals and milk.In the fuel and light group, inflation in respect of liquefied petroleum gas declined in line with international price movements. Furthermore, the rate of increase in prices of firewood and chips, and dung cake moderated.CPI inflation excluding food and fuel remained unchanged at 5.2 per cent for the third consecutive month in February, after rising from its trough in June 2017. Among its constituents, housing group inflation rose significantly, reflecting the HRA increase for central government employees. Excluding the HRA impact, inflation in this group was estimated markedly lower at 4.4 per cent. Inflation in the transport and communication group increased in February on account of the rise in petroleum product prices and transportation fares. Inflation either eased or remained at a low level in February in other major sub-groups such as household goods and services, recreation and amusement, education, and personal care and effects.Households¡¯ inflation expectations, measured by the March 2018 round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s survey of households, edged up for both three-month and one-year ahead horizons. Manufacturing firms covered in the Reserve Bank¡¯s Industrial Outlook Survey reported input price pressures and an increase in selling prices in Q4:2017-18, which are expected to continue in Q1:2018-19. Manufacturing and services firms polled by PMI also showed a rise in input and output prices in Q4."
other,"An adjustment of the Base Rate affects interest rates in the financial markets as a whole, including short-term and long-term interest rates, and deposit and lending rates. For example, if the Bank of Korea raises its Base Rate, short-term interest rates such as overnight call rates rise immediately, deposit and lending rates show an underlying upward tendency, and long-term interest rates come under upward pressures. Such movements of various interest rates affect aggregate demand in the form of both consumption and investment. For instance, a hike in interest rates leads to a curb on borrowings, an increase in savings, rises in interest remuneration on deposits and on loans, and ultimately a decline in household consumption. This also applies to businesses. Ceteris paribus, an increase in interest rates raises financial expenses and accordingly reduces investment.A change in the Base Rate also influences prices of assets including stocks, bonds and real estate. For instance, if the Base Rate rises, the present value of future profits to be gained through assets such as stocks, bonds and real estate declines, and asset prices accordingly go down. This leads to a decrease in households' assets, or wealth, serving as a factor in bringing down household consumption.An adjustment of the Base Rate also influences banks' lending behavior. For example, if there is a Base Rate hike, banks may become even more prudent than before in lending, concerned about the redemption capacity of borrowers. This dampens both investment by businesses raising funds through bank loans and credit-based consumption by households.A change in the Base Rate affects the foreign exchange rate as well. For instance, if the Base Rate rises in Korea while rates in other countries remain unchanged, returns on Korean won-denominated assets will increase relatively, which will attract foreign capital. As the number of persons hoping to purchase Korean won-denominated assets grows, the won will appreciate. Its appreciation will bring down prices of imported goods and services and demand for them will accordingly grow. This will in turn push up prices of export goods denominated in foreign currency, which will lead to a decline in overseas demand for Korean goods and services.These changes in aggregate demand, in the form of consumption, investment and exports (overseas demand), through various channels again affect prices. For instance, a fall in aggregate demand, in terms such as consumption, investment and exports, following a hike in the Base Rate, serves to put downward pressure on prices. In the exchange rate channel, in particular, a fall in Korean won-denominated import prices resulting from the won's appreciation serves as a direct factor in bringing down domestic consumer prices.An adjustment of the Base Rate leads to a change in inflation expectations, consequently affecting prices. For example, an increase in the Base Rate is interpreted as showing the Bank of Korea's resolve to reduce price inflation, which brings inflation expectations down. This consequently influences firms' setting of their product prices and wages, as a result pulling real price inflation down.

drought,"The worst drought in living memory is sweeping parts of eastern Australia, leaving farmers struggling to cope and asking questions about their future.
Record-low rainfall in some regions and successive seasons of above-average temperatures have blighted vast tracts of Australia's grazing and crop land.
While droughts are common in Australia, climate scientists say climate change is expected to cause longer and more intense droughts as well as greater extremes of temperature.
While the weather has improved in parts of Western Australia, winter rain has gone missing across much of the country's east, leaving farmers praying for rain after planting seed in dry soil or culling cattle and sheep they can no longer afford to feed.
New South Wales, which just recorded its fifth-driest July on record, has been hardest hit. About 99 per cent of the state - which accounts for a quarter of Australia's agricultural output by value - is now officially in drought.
The federal government on Sunday (Aug 5) announced a A$190 million (S$192 million) aid package for drought-afflicted farmers.
Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced the funding which will give farmers in need lump sum payments and support mental health initiatives and community groups. ""These are very exceptional circumstances and it's important that we react and respond with the support that farmers need,"" Turnbull told reporters. ""It is a shocking drought,"" Turnbull said at a farm in Trangie, west of the city of Dubbo in NSW."
other,"Global trade lost some traction due to intensification of trade wars and uncertainty stemming from Brexit negotiations. Crude oil prices, which remained volatile and elevated in May-June on a delicate demand-supply balance, eased modestly in the second half of July on higher supply from Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC producers. Base metal prices have fallen on the general risk-off sentiment triggered by fears of an intensification of trade wars. Gold prices have softened on a stronger dollar. Inflation remained firm in the US, reflecting higher oil prices and stronger aggregate demand. Inflation has edged up also in some other major advanced and emerging economies, driven, in part, by rising energy prices and pass-through effects from currency depreciations.Financial markets have continued to be driven mainly by monetary policy stances in major AEs and geopolitical tensions. Equity markets in AEs have declined on trade tensions and uncertainty relating to Brexit negotiations. Investors¡¯ appetite for EME assets has waned on increases in interest rates by the US Fed. The 10-year sovereign yield in the US has moderated somewhat from its peak on May 17 on safe-haven demand, spurred by escalating trade conflicts. Yields have softened in other key AEs as well. In most EMEs, however, movements in yields have varied reflecting domestic macroeconomic fundamentals and tightening global liquidity. Capital flows to EMEs declined in anticipation of monetary policy tightening in AEs. In currency markets, the US dollar appreciated, supported by strong economic data. The euro strengthened in June on receding political uncertainty and taper talk by the central bank. However, the currency has traded soft thereafter on mixed economic data and the rising US dollar. EME currencies, in general, have depreciated against the US dollar over the last month."

drought,"As parts of Western Turkey battle against recent heavy rain and flooding, the country is facing its most severe drought in a decade.
Istanbul has been warned it has less than 45 days of water left due to poor rainfall in the second half of last year.
""Last year the level of water in dams in Istanbul was twice what it is now, so it wasn't that bad. Now we are in the second year and experiencing rougher droughts,"" Dr Akgün ?lhan, a water management expert, told Euronews.
Ankara's mayor said earlier this month that the capital only had another 110 days’ worth of water left in dams and reservoirs.
Other cities across the country are also struggling with dams and reservoirs below 40 per cent full. Elsewhere farmers in wheat-producing areas fear their crop will fail.
""Since the late 1980s Turkey has faced drought periods,"" says Dr. ?lhan. ""It's every 4-7 years, which is the result of global climate change.""
""However,"" she says, ""what we face now is to a large extent a lack of adaptation or even maladaptation to climate change.""
Whilst it's true that the country receives less precipitation, it also ""makes inefficient use of the water falling on our cities."""
Typhoon,"Typhoon Fitow barrelled into China's east coast early Monday, packing winds of more than 200 kilometres an hour after hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated, state media reported.
At least two people were reported killed, both near Wenzhou in Zhejiang province, the state news agency Xinhua said.
Parts of Zhejiang, which neighbours the commercial hub Shanghai, saw nearly 29 centimetres (11 inches) of rain over 17 hours from Sunday to early Monday, while areas in Fujian to the south saw up to 16 centimetres, the official China News Service said.
In the hard-hit Cangnan county in Wenzhou, more than 1,200 homes collapsed and damages amounted to hundreds of millions of yuan, China National Radio said.
One of the victims, 55-year-old Ni Wenlin, died ""after strong wind blew him off a hill"" late Sunday, Xinhua said, citing municipal flood control authorities.
In Fujian the typhoon broke electricity poles in half, leaving power lines on the ground, and bent iron roadsigns out of shape, CNR reported.
In the coastal city of Ningde, a village leader told the Beijing Times that huge waves had damaged a 200-hectare (490-acre) seaweed farm, which nearly 100 families depended on for their livelihood.
The typhoon ""broke the bamboo poles holding the seaweed in place"", said Lin Fangqin.
The storm is expected to move northwest but ""weaken quickly"", Xinhua said on Monday, citing the National Meteorological Centre (NMC).
Authorities evacuated hundreds of thousands of people and issued China's highest alert on Sunday as Fitow approached the mainland.
The NMC issued a red alert for the storm, which was packing winds of up to 151 kilometres (94 miles) an hour late Sunday night as it moved towards the coast
Winds rose to 201 km per hour in parts of Wenzhou, the official Xinhua news agency reported later, citing local flood control authorities.
Zhejiang has so far evacuated more than 574,000 people, while in Fujian 177,000 have been displaced, Xinhua said.
Two port workers in Wenzhou were missing and may have fallen into the sea, the agency added.
Zhejiang governor Li Qiang urged local authorities to increase inspections of dams and reservoirs as well as safety checks of chemical plants and other important facilities, Xinhua reported.
The storm also forced the suspension of bullet train services in several cities in Zhejiang, Fujian and Jiangxi provinces, Xinhua said.
Wenzhou's airport cancelled 27 flights Sunday, the agency said.
Xinhua quoted the weather centre as saying it was unusual for a typhoon to come ashore in China's southeast during October, at the end of the storm season.
Chinese maritime authorities also issued red alerts, warning of storm tides and waves, with fishermen urged to return to port and local authorities told to prepare harbour facilities and sea walls for high tides.
In Zhejiang more than 35,000 boats returned to harbour while in Fujian nearly 30,000 vessels were called back, according to Xinhua.
Named after a flower from Micronesia, Fitow has hit just two weeks after Typhoon Usagi wreaked havoc in the region, leaving at least 25 reported dead in southern China.
Fitow, which Xinhua described as the 23rd storm to hit China this year, earlier passed through Japan's southern Okinawan island chain, forcing flight cancellations and causing power outages.
Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau had issued a warning over the storm Sunday morning as it surged past the north of the island.
A total of 103 international flights were cancelled in Taiwan, while 14 flights were delayed. Seventeen ferry services between Taiwan and offshore islands were also halted."
Typhoon,"A powerful typhoon has struck the Philippines, triggering floods and cutting power in the capital, Manila and throughout the main island, Luzon.
At least 16 people have been killed, including several children, most of them in Manila.
Typhoon Nesat also forced the closure of the Philippine Stock Exchange and the US embassy, and the ground floor of Manila's main hospital was flooded.
More than 100,000 people in Albay province were ordered to evacuate.
And thousands of residents of the capital flocked to school buildings for shelter - many carrying pets, TV sets, bags of clothes and other belongings.
However, caretaker Banny Domanais arrived at a school in the Marikina district with his wife and three daughters having left his possessions behind.
""We can replace things, but not people's lives,"" he said.
Witnesses said flooding in parts of Manila was the worst for decades.
The eye of the storm has blown out into the South China Sea, and is expected to hit southern China later in the week.
Nesat made landfall just before dawn on Tuesday in the eastern Isabela and Aurora provinces on the Pacific coast.
The storm, with a diameter of 650km (400 miles), hit land carrying gusts of wind up to 170km/h.
Many roads have been flooded and flights cancelled, and local media are urging people against non-essential travel, says the BBC's Kate McGeown in Zambales province, Luzon."

The volcano, about 200km (125 miles) west of Tokyo, erupted without warning on Saturday, spewing ash and rocks. About 250 people were trapped on the slopes of the popular beauty spot, but most got down safely. Japan is one of the world's most seismically active nations - but there have been no fatalities from volcanic eruptions since 1991, when 43 people died at Mount Unzen in the south-west."
earthquake,"A magnitude-7.0 earthquake occurred in the far southern Philippine Sea off the coast of southeastern Mindano region of the Philippines. The epicenter was approximately 210 km (130 miles) southeast of Pondaguitan, Philippines. The tremor occurred at a depth of about 95.8 km (59.5 miles), and moderate-to-strong shaking was probably felt in the Philippine Sea near the epicenter. Weak-to-light shaking was probably felt in far southeastern Mindanao region. There have been no initial reports of damage or casualties as a result of the earthquake; however, significant damage is unlikely in the Philippines due to the depth and location of this event. It could take several hours until authorities can conduct comprehensive damage assessments, especially in remote areas. Aftershocks are likely over the coming days. The event has not prompted any tsunami advisories.Officials may temporarily shut down transportation infrastructure in the tremor zone to check for damage. Minor disruptions could occur during shutdowns, but service will likely resume quickly if no damage is found. Utility outages are possible, particularly near the earthquake's epicenter."

The Addis Ababa-based Red Sea Afar Democratic Organization (RSADO) said the volcanic eruption has killed at least seven people, injured many others and displaced thousands of people. “We call on the international community to swiftly use diplomatic pressure over the Eritrean government to allow an international humanitarian aid to the thousands of volcano-hit people’’ reached by phone Yasin Mohamed Abdela, RSADO spokesperson told Sudan Tribune from the Ethiopia-Eritrea border. Independent news about the eruption is hard to come by as Eritrea does not allow independent local journalists or foreign correspondents into the the Red Sea nation. The RSADO official accused the Eritrean government of hiding the level of the disaster. He said that his party holds the Eritrean government accountable for the loss of life and other related damage caused by the volcanic activity."

More than 800 people have been injured. Thousands of others were left homeless. The 6.2 earthquake, with an epicenter 36 kilometers south of West Sulawesi province’s Mamuju district and at a depth of 18 kilometers, struck after 2 a.m. on Friday, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Rescue teams, aided by heavy equipment, have worked around the clock searching for survivors in the hardest-hit city of Mamuju and the neighboring district of Majene. Power supplies and telephone service have improved since Friday, aiding rescue operations. On Thursday, a 5.9-magnitude undersea quake struck the same region, damaging several homes but causing no casualties. Earthquakes, volcanos and tsunamis are common in Indonesia due to its location on the “Ring of Fire,” which is one of the world's most seismically active areas. In 2018, a 7.5-magnitude_earthquake_and a tsunami that followed in Palu on Sulawesi killed more than 4,000 people."
