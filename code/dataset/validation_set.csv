wildfires,"Last week featured one of the worst June heat waves in decades across the West, shattering hundreds of daily records, as well as several all-time hottest temperatures recorded for the month.
Death Valley soared to a blistering 128 degrees, and Denver saw a rare hat trick of three 100-degree days in a row.
Tucson saw eight straight days of temperatures 110 degrees or higher, breaking the record for the number of consecutive days above that barrier and making it the city's hottest week. Phoenix endured a record-setting six straight days of temperatures 115 or higher.
All of this heat contributed to a high fire danger which came to fruition over the weekend when multiple blazes broke out in several Western states including California, Colorado, Arizona and Oregon.
The Willow Fire in Monterey County, which forced evacuations Friday, continued to burn over the weekend sending smoke billowing into the Bay Area.
The Cow Fire in Shasta County also prompted evacuation orders, and at one point Sunday required a large air tanker to be diverted off the Willow Fire for increased firefighting efforts.
On Monday, 7 million people were under red flag warnings across six Western states where the combination of hot temperatures, wind gusts to 40 mph and bone-dry humidity lead to a critical fire threat.
Las Vegas was included in the risk zone for the fire danger.
The most recent heat wave was focused over portions of the Four Corners, desert Southwest and Southern and Central California. Next week, however, the area of most exceptional heat could park over northern California and the Pacific Northwest."
other,"FOMC participants see inflation remaining low; most project that overall inflation will be about 1-1/4 to 1-3/4 percent this year and in the range of 1 to 2 percent next year and in 2013. Private-sector forecasters generally also anticipate subdued inflation over the next few years.3 Measures of medium- and long-term inflation compensation derived from inflation-indexed Treasury bonds appear broadly consistent with these forecasts. Surveys of households suggest that the public's longer-term inflation expectations also remain stable.Although overall inflation is low, since summer we have seen significant increases in some highly visible prices, including those of gasoline and other commodities. Notably, in the past few weeks, concerns about unrest in the Middle East and North Africa and the possible effects on global oil supplies have led oil and gasoline prices to rise further. More broadly, the increases in commodity prices in recent months have largely reflected rising global demand for raw materials, particularly in some fast-growing emerging market economies, coupled with constraints on global supply in some cases. Commodity prices have risen significantly in terms of all major currencies, suggesting that changes in the foreign exchange value of the dollar are unlikely to have been an important driver of the increases seen in recent months.The rate of pass-through from commodity price increases to broad indexes of U.S. consumer prices has been quite low in recent decades, partly reflecting the relatively small weight of materials inputs in total production costs as well as the stability of longer-term inflation expectations. Currently, the cost pressures from higher commodity prices are also being offset by the stability in unit labor costs. Thus, the most likely outcome is that the recent rise in commodity prices will lead to, at most, a temporary and relatively modest increase in U.S. consumer price inflation--an outlook consistent with the projections of both FOMC participants and most private forecasters. That said, sustained rises in the prices of oil or other commodities would represent a threat both to economic growth and to overall price stability, particularly if they were to cause inflation expectations to become less well anchored. We will continue to monitor these developments closely and are prepared to respond as necessary to best support the ongoing recovery in a context of price stability."
Typhoon,"The Atlantic hurricane season is off to a record fast start and is likely to get worse The 2020 Atlantic hurricane season is already making history, just over a month after it officially began. When Tropical Storm Edouard formed Sunday night over the open waters of the northwest Atlantic, it became the earliest fifth named storm on record. Edouard has since morphed into a nontropical storm, but it signals the possibility of a long and punishing hurricane season, which has already set records linked to abnormally warm ocean waters. Tropical storms and hurricanes require sea surface temperatures of at least 79 degrees to form and sustain themselves, and have expanded farther north than usual this summer. Edouard, for example, formed amid sea surface temperatures near 80 degrees, about four to five degrees above average."
drought,"Increasing drought in north China's Inner Mongolia has already affected 45 percent of the region, local authorities reported on Sunday, June 7, 2020. On Monday, a sweltering temperature of almost 40 °C (104 °F) was recorded in the area. 
The regional meteorological bureau and the regional department of agriculture and husbandry said the dry spell has reached about 44 million ha (110 million acres) in the area.
Since May, the central and western parts of the region have had less significant rainfall, accompanied by warming temperatures.
The dry weather remains severe in more than half of the pasturing areas across the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
On Monday, temperatures reached around 39 °C (102 °F) in the provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Jilin Liaoning, and in Beijing municipality, according to the China Meteorological Administration.
The administration forecast that in June, hot temperatures will rage in most parts of China for longer than the usual."
other,"The federal detention center in New York that is notoriously known as the place where Jeffrey Epstein was found dead in his cell is in the process of being temporarily closed, according to a Justice Department spokesperson.
The Metropolitan Correctional Center in Lower Manhattan drew criticism for its management after Epstein was found dead there in 2019, shortly after his arrest on charges that he operated a sex trafficking ring in which he allegedly sexually abused dozens of underage girls.
The facility has also been occupied by other high-profile people, including Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, who was housed there before and during his federal trial.
A Justice Department spokesperson said in a statement to CNN that the department was committed to ensuring that facilities in the federal prison system are ""safe and secure.""
""As part of this effort, the Bureau of Prisons has assessed steps necessary to improve conditions at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York City,"" the spokesperson said. ""In an effort to address the issues at MCC NY as quickly and efficiently as possible, the Department has decided to close the MCC, at least temporarily, until those issues have been resolved.""
""Planning for the deactivation is under way, and we will have more updates as that process continues,"" the statement read.
The New York Daily News was first to report on the closure.
There are 263 inmates currently housed at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, according to the Bureau of Prisons website.
David Patton, the executive director and attorney-in-chief of the Federal Defenders of New York, welcomed the government's decision to temporarily shutter the facility, saying it ""has been a long-standing disgrace.""
""It's cramped, dark and unsanitary. The building is falling apart. Chronic shortages of medical staff mean that people suffer for long periods of time when they have urgent medical issues,"" Patton said, adding that he worries the Metropolitan Detention Center, a nearby federal prison in Brooklyn, ""suffers many of the same problems."""
other,"The economic expansion is well into its 11th year, and it is the longest on record. Over the second half of last year, economic activity increased at a moderate pace and the labor market strengthened further, as the economy appeared resilient to the global headwinds that had intensified last summer. Inflation has been low and stable but has continued to run below the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) symmetric 2 percent objective.Job gains averaged 200,000 per month in the second half of last year, and an additional 225,000 jobs were added in January. The pace of job gains has remained above what is needed to provide jobs for new workers entering the labor force, allowing the unemployment rate to move down further over the course of last year. The unemployment rate was 3.6 percent last month and has been near half-century lows for more than a year. Job openings remain plentiful. Employers are increasingly willing to hire workers with fewer skills and train them. As a result, the benefits of a strong labor market have become more widely shared. People who live and work in low- and middle-income communities are finding new opportunities. Employment gains have been broad based across all racial and ethnic groups and levels of education. Wages have been rising, particularly for lower-paying jobs.Gross domestic product rose at a moderate rate over the second half of last year. Growth in consumer spending moderated toward the end of the year following earlier strong increases, but the fundamentals supporting household spending remain solid. Residential investment turned up in the second half, but business investment and exports were weak, largely reflecting sluggish growth abroad and trade developments. Those same factors weighed on activity at the nation's factories, whose output declined over the first half of 2019 and has been little changed, on net, since then. The February Monetary Policy Report discusses the recent weakness in manufacturing. Some of the uncertainties around trade have diminished recently, but risks to the outlook remain. In particular, we are closely monitoring the emergence of the coronavirus, which could lead to disruptions in China that spill over to the rest of the global economy.Inflation ran below the FOMC's symmetric 2 percent objective throughout 2019. Over the 12 months through December, overall inflation based on the price index for personal consumption expenditures was 1.6 percent. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was also 1.6 percent. Over the next few months, we expect inflation to move closer to 2 percent, as unusually low readings from early 2019 drop out of the 12-month calculation.The nation faces important longer-run challenges. Labor force participation by individuals in their prime working years is at its highest rate in more than a decade. However, it remains lower than in most other advanced economies, and there are troubling labor market disparities across racial and ethnic groups and across regions of the country. In addition, although it is encouraging that productivity growth, the main engine for raising wages and living standards over the longer term, has moved up recently, productivity gains have been subpar throughout this economic expansion. Finding ways to boost labor force participation and productivity growth would benefit Americans and should remain a national priority."
other,"The central bank¡¯s independence was put into question when Erdogan fired previous bank chiefs, most recently in March. The current head of the bank, Sahap Kavcioglu, replaced Naci Agbal. Kavcioglu has argued for low interest rates in columns for a pro-government daily newspaper.Agbal raised the interest rate by a more-than-expected 2 percentage points in March, taking the rate to 19%. The Turkish lira also tumbled with Agbal¡¯s sacking after having made gains during his tenure."
other,"Since my appearance before this Committee last July, the employment situation in the United States has been improving along many dimensions. The unemployment rate now stands at 5.7 percent, down from just over 6 percent last summer and from 10 percent at its peak in late 2009. The average pace of monthly job gains picked up from about 240,000 per month during the first half of last year to 280,000 per month during the second half, and employment rose 260,000 in January. In addition, long-term unemployment has declined substantially, fewer workers are reporting that they can find only part-time work when they would prefer full-time employment, and the pace of quits--often regarded as a barometer of worker confidence in labor market opportunities--has recovered nearly to its pre-recession level. However, the labor force participation rate is lower than most estimates of its trend, and wage growth remains sluggish, suggesting that some cyclical weakness persists. In short, considerable progress has been achieved in the recovery of the labor market, though room for further improvement remains.At the same time that the labor market situation has improved, domestic spending and production have been increasing at a solid rate. Real gross domestic product (GDP) is now estimated to have increased at a 3-3/4 percent annual rate during the second half of last year. While GDP growth is not anticipated to be sustained at that pace, it is expected to be strong enough to result in a further gradual decline in the unemployment rate. Consumer spending has been lifted by the improvement in the labor market as well as by the increase in household purchasing power resulting from the sharp drop in oil prices. However, housing construction continues to lag; activity remains well below levels we judge could be supported in the longer run by population growth and the likely rate of household formation.Despite the overall improvement in the U.S. economy and the U.S. economic outlook, longer-term interest rates in the United States and other advanced economies have moved down significantly since the middle of last year; the declines have reflected, at least in part, disappointing foreign growth and changes in monetary policy abroad. Another notable development has been the plunge in oil prices. The bulk of this decline appears to reflect increased global supply rather than weaker global demand. While the drop in oil prices will have negative effects on energy producers and will probably result in job losses in this sector, causing hardship for affected workers and their families, it will likely be a significant overall plus, on net, for our economy. Primarily, that boost will arise from U.S. households having the wherewithal to increase their spending on other goods and services as they spend less on gasoline.Foreign economic developments, however, could pose risks to the outlook for U.S. economic growth. Although the pace of growth abroad appears to have stepped up slightly in the second half of last year, foreign economies are confronting a number of challenges that could restrain economic activity. In China, economic growth could slow more than anticipated as policymakers address financial vulnerabilities and manage the desired transition to less reliance on exports and investment as sources of growth. In the euro area, recovery remains slow, and inflation has fallen to very low levels; although highly accommodative monetary policy should help boost economic growth and inflation there, downside risks to economic activity in the region remain. The uncertainty surrounding the foreign outlook, however, does not exclusively reflect downside risks. We could see economic activity respond to the policy stimulus now being provided by foreign central banks more strongly than we currently anticipate, and the recent decline in world oil prices could boost overall global economic growth more than we expect.U.S. inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent objective. In large part, the recent softness in the all-items measure of inflation for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) reflects the drop in oil prices. Indeed, the PCE price index edged down during the fourth quarter of last year and looks to be on track to register a more significant decline this quarter because of falling consumer energy prices. But core PCE inflation has also slowed since last summer, in part reflecting declines in the prices of many imported items and perhaps also some pass-through of lower energy costs into core consumer prices.Despite the very low recent readings on actual inflation, inflation expectations as measured in a range of surveys of households and professional forecasters have thus far remained stable. However, inflation compensation, as calculated from the yields of real and nominal Treasury securities, has declined. As best we can tell, the fall in inflation compensation mainly reflects factors other than a reduction in longer-term inflation expectations. The Committee expects inflation to decline further in the near term before rising gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of lower energy prices and other factors dissipate, but we will continue to monitor inflation developments closely."
wildfires,"Conservationists fear hundreds of koalas have perished in wildfires that have razed prime habitat on Australia's east coast.
Port Macquarie Koala Hospital President Sue Ashton said she hoped wildlife carers would be allowed to begin their search of the fire zone for survivors on Thursday.
The fire was started by a lightning strike on Friday in a forest in New South Wales state, 300 kilometers north of Sydney, and has since burnt 4,900 acres.
Two-thirds of that area was koala habitat, Ashton said. ""If we look at a 50 per cent survival rate, that's around about 350 koalas and that's absolutely devastating,"" Ashton said of the death toll.
""We're hoping it's not as bad as that, but because of the intensity of the fire and the way koalas behave during fire, we're not holding out too much hope,"" she added.
Koalas climb high into trees during wildfires and survive if the fire front passes quickly below them.
The koala colony was particularly heathy and genetically diverse, Ashton said. Koalas prefer coastal forests, which are being cleared for suburban expansion. Increasingly isolated koala colonies have become inbred and diseased.
Australia's wildfire season has made a particularly early and devastating start in the southern hemisphere spring due to above-average temperatures and below-average rainfall that has left much of the east coast in drought."
drought,"Endless sunny weather with little or no rain in sight has prompted regional and local officials to warn that near-drought conditions could lead to water shortages unless residents begin conserving.
A water shortage warning has been declared by the St. Johns River Water Management District due to extreme drought conditions in the 18 Northeast Florida counties within its jurisdiction. The warning was expanded from seven of those counties named in an initial warning declared in March due to the effects of below-average rainfall across parts of the district.
The warning order aims to reduce water usage and increase awareness of the need for conservation. District officials said conditions have not yet reached a point where there is an expectation of insufficient water to meet anticipated demand and protect water resources, officials said. But current conditions do warrant heightened water conservation in all areas within its jurisdiction. That includes sticking to the current watering restrictions, which mandate residential landscape irrigation only between 4 p.m. and 10 a.m. and no more than two days per week.
Less than two weeks ago, JEA executives urged its water customers to conserve after a substantial 8.1 percent increase in usage over last year. The electric and water utility blamed two unusually dry years for last year’s increase, which was 6 percent higher than the previous year after downward trends in water consumption. Reasons for the increased use also included an unusually warm winter and substantially increased water used for irrigation, JEA officials said.
May and June are dry in Northeast Florida almost every year, with a rainy season that doesn’t usually begin until July and August. But while Northeast Florida usually gets 50 to 54 inches of rain a year, it only saw about 40 inches last year, JEA officials said.
The dry weather has led to many wildfires, the largest the lightning-sparked West Mims blaze that began April 4 in the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge in Florida’s Baker County and has now consumed about 152,230 acres as it continues to burn into Georgia’s Charlton County. It is only 18 percent contained, Florida Forest Service officials said. There are currently 94 active wildfires in Florida statewide burning about 39,925 acres.
The arid weather and the growing number of wildfires also forced Mayor Lenny Curry to extend Jacksonville’s burn ban last week restricting bonfires, campfires and other ceremonial fires through June 1, or until weather conditions improve. The dry conditions have forced 42 of the state’s 67 counties, including every one in Northeast Florida, to institute a burn ban, according to the Florida Forest Service."
earthquake,"Early on Tuesday morning, a powerful magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck near the coast of Northern Chile. The first seismic activity recorded was located 48km from Huasco at 5.30am (UK time), according to US Geological Survey (USGS). Bolivia, Chile and Argentina were all affected.
The GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences reported that had been some damage and minor landslides but no apparent fatalities. Communities close to the coastline were evacuated, though fortunately, a tsunami was not triggered.
After the initial quake, aftershocks between magnitudes 5 and 6.1 were reported. Many more could be expected in the coming days, and even weeks. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no tsunami threat from the earthquake.
Chile's National Emergency Office of the Ministry of the Interior and Public Security said the event was unlikely to cause major disruption to services or infrastructure, though some places were disturbed. An image shared on social media shows a shaken supermarket after the event.
The quake was revealed to be at a depth of 10km (which equates to around 6.2 miles), and connected to underlying fault movement along a subduction zone."
other,"The first advance estimates of GDP for 2020-21 released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on January 7, 2021 estimated real GDP to contract by 7.7 per cent, in line with the projection of (-)7.5 per cent set out in the December 2020 resolution of the MPC. High frequency indicators _ railway freight traffic; toll collection; e-way bills; and steel consumption _ suggest that revival of some constituents of the services sector gained traction in Q3 (October-December). The agriculture sector remains resilient - rabi sowing was higher by 2.9 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) as on January 29, 2021, supported by above normal north-east monsoon rainfall and adequate reservoir level of 61 per cent (as on February 4, 2021) of full capacity, above the 10 years average of 50 per cent.After breaching the upper tolerance threshold of 6 per cent for six consecutive months (June-November 2020), CPI inflation fell to 4.6 per cent in December on the back of easing food prices and favourable base effects. Food inflation collapsed to 3.9 per cent in December after averaging 9.6 per cent during the previous three months (September-November) due to a sharp correction in vegetable prices and softening of cereal prices with kharif harvest arrivals, alongside supply side interventions. On the other hand, core inflation, i.e. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel remained elevated at 5.5 per cent in December with marginal moderation from a month ago. In the January 2021 round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s survey, inflation expectations of households softened further over a three month ahead horizon in tandem with the moderation in food inflation; one year ahead inflation expectations, however, remained unchanged.Systemic liquidity remained in large surplus in December 2020 and January 2021, engendering easy financial conditions. Reserve money rose by 14.5 per cent y-o-y (on January 29, 2021), led by currency demand. Money supply (M3), on the other hand, grew by only 12.5 per cent as on January 15, 2021, but with non-food credit growth of scheduled commercial banks accelerating to 6.4 per cent. Corporate bond issuances at _5.8 lakh crore during April-December 2020 were higher than _4.6 lakh crore in the same period of last year.

Project HOPE’s Emergency Response Team (ERT) reports that since some of the region’s health facilities were built in low lying, coastal areas, the population is concerned about visiting them. Health teams establishing themselves following the earthquake have opted for operations on higher ground due to concerns of additional earthquakes and the potential for tsunamis. Health care teams are also primarily establishing outdoor clinics due to concern over the stability of buildings. In addition to injuries as a direct result of the earthquake, the ERT has received reports of health need including hypertension, dyspepsia, neuropathy, fevers and other cold symptoms."

Typhoon,"Heavy rains and high winds were hitting China’s eastern coastal region Tuesday from a tropical storm weakening as it neared Shanghai.
Hagiput was a typhoon with winds blowing up to 137 kilometers (85 miles) per hour at its center when it made landfall in Zhejiang province in the early morning. At noon, the tropical storm had winds of up to 108 kph (67 mph) and was moving north at around 25 kph (16 mph), China’s National Meteorological Center said.
No major destruction or injuries have been reported. State broadcaster CCTV showed trees toppled in the Zhejiang city of Yuhuan and the fire service said a panel truck had been blown on its side by high winds early Tuesday and its driver rescued.
As of Tuesday evening, the storm center was located near the city of Shaoxing, about 160 kilometers (100 miles) south of Shanghai, according to the meteorological center’s website. Shanghai was hot and windy in the evening with sporadic showers.
Forecaster Zhang Ling told state broadcaster CCTV that the storm was continuing to weaken as it moved.
“The effects will be felt (in China) through Wednesday,” Zhang said. However, rainfall will have peaked by the end of Tuesday, she said.
China had ordered evacuations of vulnerable coastal areas in Zhejiang and Fujian provinces to the south, recalled fishing boats and suspended ferry service and some trains.
In the major Zhejiang manufacturing center of Wenzhou, south of Shanghai, authorities reported evacuating 200,000 people to shelters and recalling more than 6,000 fishing boats to port. Waves along the coast were reported at heights of 4.2 meters (14 feet).
This year’s typhoon season has been relatively mild in China, although flooding since June along its major river systems has caused scores of deaths, forced around 2 million people to be evacuated and caused more than 49 billion yuan (7 billion) in damage."
other,"The December bi-monthly resolution projected inflation in the range of 4.3-4.7 per cent in the second half of 2017-18, including the impact of increase in HRA. In terms of actual outcomes, headline inflation averaged 4.6 per cent in Q3, driven primarily by an unusual pick-up in food prices in November. Though prices eased in December, the winter seasonal food price moderation was less than usual. Domestic pump prices of petrol and diesel rose sharply in January, reflecting lagged pass-through of the past increases in international crude oil prices. Considering these factors, inflation is now estimated at 5.1 per cent in Q4, including the HRA impact.The inflation outlook beyond the current year is likely to be shaped by several factors. First, international crude oil prices have firmed up sharply since August 2017, driven by both demand and supply side factors. Second, non-oil industrial raw material prices have also witnessed a global uptick. Firms polled in the Reserve Bank¡¯s IOS expect input prices to harden in Q4. In a scenario of improving economic activity, rising input costs are likely to be passed on to consumers. Third, the inflation outlook will depend on the monsoon, which is assumed to be normal. Taking these factors into consideration, CPI inflation for 2018-19 is estimated in the range of 5.1-5.6 per cent in H1, including diminishing statistical HRA impact of central government employees, and 4.5-4.6 per cent in H2, with risks tilted to the upside (Chart 1). The projected moderation in inflation in the second half is on account of strong favourable base effects, including unwinding of the 7th CPC¡¯s HRA impact, and a softer food inflation forecast, given the assumption of normal monsoon and effective supply management by the Government.Turning to the growth outlook, GVA growth for 2017-18 is projected at 6.6 per cent. Beyond the current year, the growth outlook will be influenced by several factors. First, GST implementation is stabilising, which augurs well for economic activity. Second, there are early signs of revival in investment activity as reflected in improving credit offtake, large resource mobilisation from the primary capital market, and improving capital goods production and imports. Third, the process of recapitalisation of public sector banks has got underway. Large distressed borrowers are being referenced for resolution under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). This should improve credit flows further and create demand for fresh investment. Fourth, although export growth is expected to improve further on account of improving global demand, elevated commodity prices, especially of oil, may act as a drag on aggregate demand. Taking into consideration the above factors, GVA growth for 2018-19 is projected at 7.2 per cent overall _ in the range of 7.3-7.4 per cent in H1 and 7.1-7.2 per cent in H2 _ with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2)."
Typhoon,"The devastation caused by Hurricane Iota became clearer Wednesday as images emerged showing piles of wind-tossed lumber that used to be homes and concrete walls that were pounded into pieces by the second Category 4 storm to blast Nicaragua’s Caribbean coast in two weeks.
Nicaragua Vice President and first lady Rosario Murillo on Wednesday raised the nation’s death toll to 16. The victims were spread across the country, swept away by swollen rivers or buried in landslides.
Rescuers searched at the site of a landslide in northern Nicaragua, where the local government confirmed four deaths and neighbors spoke of at least 16. A short video from the nation’s emergency management agency showed a massive bowl-shaped mountainside shrouded in clouds that collapsed. Police blocked media access to the site on the Macizo de Pe?as Blancas, a mountain in Matagalpa province, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) north of Managua.
There were seven confirmed dead at the mountain, and the search continued, Murillo said.
Miguel Rodríguez, who works on a ranch next to the site, said he saw at least seven bodies.
“The landslide came with all the dirt, and it became like a river going down. It took all of the little houses that were there. There were five homes, five families,” Rodríguez said.
One home was spared on the other side of the slide. But it was in a precarious position, and rescuers were trying to reach it, he said."
Typhoon,"Tropical Storm Gonzalo approaches the Caribbean, could strengthen into a hurricane Tropical Storm Gonzalo is accelerating as it moves towards the southern Caribbean, the National Hurricane Center said Friday morning. Gonzalo formed on Wednesday in the central Atlantic Basin, and forecasts show there's a chance it could strengthen into a hurricane. A hurricane watch is in effect for the islands of Barbados, St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Those islands plus St. Lucia are also under a tropical storm warning. As of 11 a.m. Friday, Gonzalo had maximum sustained winds near 50 mph, with higher gusts, and was moving to the west at about 18 mph. The storm is forecast to reach the southern Lesser Antilles by Saturday. Meanwhile, in the eastern Pacific Ocean, a hurricane may threaten Hawaii by Saturday. Hurricane Douglas reached major hurricane strength — Category 3 — with winds of 130 mph as of late Thursday, located 1,250 miles east-southeast of Hilo, Hawaii. Douglas is forecast to weaken as it approaches Hawaii by later Saturday into Sunday morning. It may still be a hurricane or strong tropical storm when it reaches Hawaii. It will likely pass just north of the Big Island and possibly make landfall Sunday as a hurricane or tropical storm on Maui. Watch for heavy rain, flash flooding and winds gusting over 75 mph. If it Douglas does make landfall as a hurricane, it would only be the third time in record-keeping history that Hawaii has seen a landfalling hurricane."
other,"Fifty years ago next month, with inflation rising and growing trade deficits, President Richard Nixon suspended the conversion of the U.S. dollar into gold. This decision effectively ended the Bretton Woods system ¡ª the final attempt at an international gold standard ¡ª and ushered in a new era of floating exchange rates between major currencies, rather than rates fixed by policymakers.The end of gold-backed money and fixed exchange rates has been controversial, but it remains the right decision.Former congressman and presidential candidate Ron Paul decided to first enter politics because of his disappointment with Nixon¡¯s decision. Some commentators have argued floating exchange rates are a major source of instability and seek a return to some sort of Bretton Woods-style arrangement. Many argue that as a rules-based monetary policy, a new gold standard would constrain central banks (including the Federal Reserve) from creating inflation, and fiscal policymakers (including Congress) from running unhealthy budget deficits.While central banks should pursue a more accountable, rules-based approach to monetary policy, a new gold standard would do much more harm than good."
other,"Surging energy prices also were the dominant factor influencing U.S. inflation last year. For the second year in a row, overall consumer prices, as measured by the chain-type index for personal consumption expenditures, rose about 3 percent. Prices of consumer energy products jumped more than 20 percent, with large increases in prices of natural gas, gasoline, and fuel oil. Food prices, however, rose only modestly. And core consumer prices (that is, excluding food and energy) increased a moderate 1.9 percent.The relatively benign performance of core inflation despite the steep increases in energy prices can be attributed to several factors. Over the past few decades, the U.S. economy has become significantly less energy intensive. Also, rapid advances in productivity as well as increases in nominal wages and salaries that, on balance, have been moderate have restrained unit labor costs in recent years.Another key factor in keeping core inflation low has been confidence on the part of the public and investors in the prospects for price stability. Maintaining expectations of low and stable inflation is an essential element in the Federal Reserve's effort to promote price stability. And, thus far, the news has been good: Survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations have responded only a little to the larger fluctuations in energy prices that we have experienced, and for the most part, they were low and stable last year. Inflation compensation for the period five to ten years ahead, derived from spreads between nominal and inflation-indexed Treasury securities, has remained well anchored.Restrained inflation expectations have also been an important reason that long-term interest rates have remained relatively low. At roughly 4-1/2 percent at year-end, yields on ten-year nominal Treasury issues increased only slightly on balance over 2005 even as short-term rates rose 2 percentage points. As previous reports and testimonies from the Federal Reserve indicated, a decomposition of long-term nominal yields into spot and forward rates suggests that it is primarily the far-forward components that account for the low level of long rates. The premiums that investors demand as compensation for the risk of unforeseen changes in real interest rates and inflation appear to have declined significantly over the past decade or so. Given the more stable macroeconomic climate in the United States and in the global economy since the mid-1980s, some decline in risk premiums is not surprising. In addition, though, investors seem to expect real interest rates to remain relatively low. Such a view is consistent with a hypothesis I offered last year--that, in recent years, an excess of desired global saving over the quantity of global investment opportunities that pay historically normal returns has forced down the real interest rate prevailing in global capital markets."
other,"Global economic developments have, on balance, been more positive in recent months after economic conditions weakened earlier in 2012. There have been further signs that the Chinese economy has stabilised, underpinned by public spending and accommodative financial policies. This has provided some additional support for commodity prices and activity in east Asia, outside of Japan. In Japan, the new government has announced plans to boost domestic economic activity and combat deflation. In the United States, the full extent of the large fiscal consolidation that had been legislated to commence at the beginning of 2013 has been avoided, although decisions on spending measures and the debt ceiling were only postponed for a short while. These developments, together with earlier policy measures in the euro area, provided a boost to financial markets and have lessened some of the downside risks to global growth. At the same time, growth in most advanced economies remains subdued, unemployment rates are elevated, and these economies are likely to continue to face headwinds for some time to come; Europe, in particular, is likely to remain a potential source of instability for a while yet.World GDP is expected to grow at around 3_ per cent in 2013, before picking up to around 4 per cent in 2014. Growth in the US economy is likely to return to a long-run average pace and activity in the euro area is expected to stabilise over the next few quarters before picking up modestly. While, overall, the large advanced economies are forecast to experience only moderate growth in the near term, relatively strong growth in the fast-growing (and increasingly large) Asian economies is expected to make a substantial contribution to global demand."
wildfires,"Driven by high winds sweeping across Northern California’s bone-dry fire zones Saturday, one of the state’s most explosive wildfires, the Caldor Fire, jumped across Highway 50, crossing a key line that fire officials hoped to use to slow the spread of the fast-moving blaze.
Firefighters battling the blaze as it burns through El Dorado County had been drumming up every available tactic to keep the blaze from crossing the highway, the main artery leading to Lake Tahoe for residents and visitors alike. On Saturday afternoon, the winds pushed flames and burning embers over the highway in the Kyburz area, according to Cal Fire Incident Commander Dusty Martin.
From the fire crews’ base camp in Placerville leading northeast to the Caldor Fire’s footprint, gusts of about 25 mph blew away a protective smoke layer and started pushing flames to the northeast — closing in on the highway and small communities dotted along the roadway and surrounding forestland.
By Saturday night, the blaze was 0% contained, had burned just over 90,000 acres, destroyed 270 structures, and was still threatening more than 13,000, according to Cal Fire.
Cal Fire commanders were working Saturday night to determine how fiercely the fire was burning on the north side of the highway, which includes terrain Cal Fire Capt. Stephen Horner said could present several new challenges, including steep canyons and very dense forested areas, that could make it harder to try and contain the already fast-moving blaze.
“A lot of those questions are being asked currently,” Horner said late Saturday.
Cal Fire spokesman Capt. Keith Wade said Saturday that the Placerville sky was the clearest it had been since midweek, an eerie marker that fearsome winds had arrived. The blaze broke out on Aug. 14.
“That’s not a good sign for what’s happening up the mountain,” Wade said Saturday. “We’re feeling a significant breeze down here, so we know that up the hill it’s very active. The potential for fire impacting those homes today is very real.”
As part of the defensive stand in the area of the highway, firefighters removed dry vegetation, trees and other fuels, while others placed sprinkler lines around houses to slow the flames’ spread. In total, more than 1,500 firefighters and support crews tackled the blaze Saturday, with most lined from Sly Park Road to Kyburz along the fire’s northern front.
Caltrans officials had closed a nearly 50-mile stretch of the highway on Friday out of fears that fire, poor visibility from smoke and falling ash or trees could endanger drivers’ lives.
Caltrans spokeswoman Angela DaPrato said Saturday that those heading to and from Tahoe should take Interstate 80, but steer clear of back roads that could be unexpectedly impacted by the fire. There was no estimate for when Highway 50 may reopen.
“Anything could happen,” she said."
wildfires,"Calmer winds and cooler temperatures are aiding firefighters battling blazes in Southern California today, with arson being investigated as a possible cause.
But the fires continue to burn, with at least one person dead and more than 10,000 acres scorched. Conditions remain problematic, as the entire state is experiencing drought conditions, leaving dry brush to fuel the flames.
It’s unclear how many houses have been damaged. Investigators are still trying to figure out what caused the fires.
“We all have suspicions like the public does when we have nine fires that started all over the county,” San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore said. “We are actively investigating the start of those fires.”
A 19-year-old and 17-year-old were arrested Thursday, accused of starting a pair of smaller fires in Escondido. But authorities say those fires were quickly extinguished, and authorities don’t believe there is any connection to the larger fires that remain burning.
Firefighters found a body in a transient camp Thursday. The body was so badly burned that officials have been unable to make a positive identification."
other,"¡°Short sales¡± simply refer to financial transactions executed when traders consider certain stocks overvalued. In such cases, traders borrow the stocks in question at current market value and then sell them to willing purchasers at that same price. The short sellers then wait for the stocks¡¯ value to decline, at which point they buy the same stock at a lower price than the price at which they borrowed and sold the stock. Finally, they return that stock to the original lender from whom they initially borrowed, thus profiting on the difference.  To illustrate, imagine an investor who believes that hypothetical Stock A¡¯s current market price is overvalued at $100 per share. Accordingly, that investor borrows Stock A at $100 per share and sells it to another buyer at that same price. Later, imagine Stock A falls to $50 per share, at which point the investor snatches up shares to return to the original lender. Since the stock that is being returned to the original lender was bought for $50, the investor pockets a $50 per share profit, which was the difference between the $100 per share sale of the borrowed stock and the $50 purchase of the replacement shares."
wildfires,"The number of wildfires and acres burned in Alaska in June 2015 has exceeded what the state saw during the same month in 2004, a year considered the worst for wildfires in the state.
According to the Alaska DNR - Division of Forestry, a combined 1.6 million acres have been burned by 399 separate fires in the state this month through June 29. That is nearly double the number of fires in June 2004, which had 215 wildfires that charred 1.15 million acres.
The Associated Press reported that 314 wildfires remained active over more than 2,265 square miles as of Monday. No new evacuations occurred this past weekend, however residents in some small communities left in voluntary evacuations last week, including elders, children and those that were medically vulnerable.
Most of the fires in June 2004 were located in Alaska's interior, while this June they have been scattered throughout the state, Alaska DNR said. They added that it was unusual to have this concentration of fire starts.
Lightning strikes were a major contributor to the ignition of wildfires in both June 2015 and June 2004. However, Alaska DNR says that June 2015 has had much more lightning than June 2004. In a span of three days from June 21-23, 2015, about 50,000 lightning strikes were recorded across the state.
The largest wildfire in the state is the Iditarod River Fire, which had burned 98,183 acres through June 28. That wildfire and the other top 10 largest wildfires in Alaska through June 28 were all started by lightning strikes."
other,"Systemic liquidity alternated between surplus and deficit during August-September 2018, reflecting the combined impact of expansion of currency in circulation, Reserve Bank¡¯s forex operations and movements in government cash balances. From a daily net average surplus of _201 billion during August 1-19, 2018, liquidity moved into deficit during August 20-30. After turning into surplus during August 31-September 10 due to increased government spending, the system again moved into deficit during September 11-29 on the back of an increase in government cash balances and Reserve Bank¡¯s forex interventions. Based on an assessment of the evolving liquidity conditions, the Reserve Bank conducted two open market purchase operations in the second half of September to inject _200 billion of durable liquidity. LAF operations absorbed, on a daily net average basis, _30 billion in August, but injected _406 billion in September. The weighted average call rate (WACR), on an average, traded below the repo rate by 15 basis points (bps) in August and by 4 bps in September. Exports maintained double digit growth in July and August 2018, driven mainly by petroleum products (which benefitted from elevated crude oil prices), engineering goods, gems and jewellery, drugs and pharmaceuticals, and chemicals. However, imports grew faster than exports, reflecting not only a higher oil import bill, but also higher imports of gold, coal, electronic goods and machinery. This led to a widening of the trade deficit to US$ 35.3 billion in July-August 2018 from US$ 24.6 billion a year ago over and above the expansion in Q1:2018-19. However, higher net services receipts and private transfer receipts helped contain the current account deficit to 2.4 per cent of GDP in Q1:2018-19 from 2.5 per cent a year ago. On the financing side, net foreign direct investment (FDI) flows improved in April-July 2018. By contrast, foreign portfolio investors have been net sellers in both the equity and debt segments so far on a cumulative basis in 2018-19 due to higher US interest rates, risk-off sentiment in EMEs and escalation of trade wars. India¡¯s foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 400.5 billion on September 28, 2018."
other,"Going forward, economic activity is expected to gather pace in 2018-19, benefitting from a conducive domestic and global environment. First, the teething troubles relating to implementation of the GST are receding. Second, credit off-take has improved in the recent period and is becoming increasingly broad-based, which portends well for the manufacturing sector and new investment activity. Third, large resource mobilisation from the primary market could strengthen investment activity further in the period ahead. Fourth, the process of recapitalisation of public sector banks and resolution of distressed assets under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) may improve the business and investment environment. Fifth, global trade growth has accelerated, which should encourage exports and reduce the drag from net exports. Sixth, the thrust on rural and infrastructure sectors in the Union Budget could rejuvenate rural demand and also crowd in private investment.Notwithstanding these salubrious developments, consumer confidence dipped in the March 2018 round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s survey, with the respondents expecting a moderation over the year ahead in general economic conditions, employment situation and their income (Chart I.7).4 Overall sentiment in the manufacturing sector a quarter ahead also fell in the March 2018 round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s industrial outlook survey under the weight of weaker prospects for production, order books, capacity utilisation, employment and profit margins (Chart I.8)."
other,"The rate of inflation that is actually realized will of course depend on a variety of factors.  Inflation could be lower than we anticipate if slower-than-expected global growth moderates the pressure on the prices of energy and other commodities or if rates of domestic resource utilization fall more than we currently expect.  Upside risks to the inflation projection are also present, however, including the possibilities that energy and food prices do not flatten out or that the pass-through to core prices from higher commodity prices and from the weaker dollar may be greater than we anticipate.  Indeed, the further increases in the prices of energy and other commodities in recent weeks, together with the latest data on consumer prices, suggest slightly greater upside risks to the projections of both overall and core inflation than we saw last month.  Should high rates of overall inflation persist, the possibility also exists that inflation expectations could become less well anchored.  Any tendency of inflation expectations to become unmoored or for the Fed's inflation-fighting credibility to be eroded could greatly complicate the task of sustaining price stability and could reduce the flexibility of the FOMC to counter shortfalls in growth in the future.  Accordingly, in the months ahead, the Federal Reserve will continue to monitor closely inflation and inflation expectations.Let me turn now to the implications of these developments for monetary policy.  The FOMC has responded aggressively to the weaker outlook for economic activity, having reduced its target for the federal funds rate by 225 basis points since last summer.  As the Committee noted in its most recent post-meeting statement, the intent of those actions has been to help promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate the risks to economic activity.A critical task for the Federal Reserve over the course of this year will be to assess whether the stance of monetary policy is properly calibrated to foster our mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability in an environment of downside risks to growth, stressed financial conditions, and inflation pressures.  In particular, the FOMC will need to judge whether the policy actions taken thus far are having their intended effects.  Monetary policy works with a lag.  Therefore, our policy stance must be determined in light of the medium-term forecast for real activity and inflation as well as the risks to that forecast.  Although the FOMC participants' economic projections envision an improving economic picture, it is important to recognize that downside risks to growth remain.  The FOMC will be carefully evaluating incoming information bearing on the economic outlook and will act in a timely manner as needed to support growth and to provide adequate insurance against downside risks.Finally, I would like to say a few words about the Federal Reserve's recent actions to protect consumers in their financial transactions.  In December, following up on a commitment I made at the time of our report last July, the Board issued for public comment a comprehensive set of new regulations to prohibit unfair or deceptive practices in the mortgage market, under the authority granted us by the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994.  The proposed rules would apply to all mortgage lenders and would establish lending standards to help ensure that consumers who seek mortgage credit receive loans whose terms are clearly disclosed and that can reasonably be expected to be repaid.  Accordingly, the rules would prohibit lenders from engaging in a pattern or practice of making higher-priced mortgage loans without due regard to consumers' ability to make the scheduled payments.  In each case, a lender making a higher-priced loan would have to use third-party documents to verify the income relied on to make the credit decision.  For higher-priced loans, the proposed rules would require the lender to establish an escrow account for the payment of property taxes and homeowners' insurance and would prevent the use of prepayment penalties in circumstances where they might trap borrowers in unaffordable loans.  In addition, for all mortgage loans, our proposal addresses misleading and deceptive advertising practices, requires borrowers and brokers to agree in advance on the maximum fee that the broker may receive, bans certain practices by servicers that harm borrowers, and prohibits coercion of appraisers by lenders.  We expect substantial public comment on our proposal, and we will carefully consider all information and viewpoints while moving expeditiously to adopt final rules."

flood,"Australia to provide Vietnam $71,300 for flood relief Australia will provide AUD100,000 ($71,390) for immediate humanitarian support to people suffering due to the severe flooding in central Vietnam. The aid was announced Friday by the Australian ambassador to Vietnam, Robyn Mudie.  The central region has been hit by consecutive tropical storms, prolonged heavy rainfall, severe and widespread flooding, and landslides over the last two weeks, said to be the worst in decades, killing at least 117 and leaving 21 missing.  The dead include 35 members of two different military teams who had come to rescue landslide victims in Thua Thien-Hue and assist neighborhoods hit by landslides in Quang Tri Province.  As of Thursday more than 178,000 households in the region had been affected by floodwaters of up to two meters, 362 schools had been damaged and there has been widespread destruction of agricultural land and resources.  Mudie said: ""When Australia experienced devastating bushfires last summer, we felt the outpouring of support from the government and people of Vietnam. Today we stand in solidarity with Vietnam, as you grieve for lost loved ones and heroic first responders. We will continue monitoring relief requirements as the extent of the impact comes to light."""
other,"Inflation has evolved along the projected trajectory and the target set for January 2016 was met with a marginal undershoot. Going forward, CPI inflation is expected to decelerate modestly and remain around 5 per cent during 2016-17 with small inter-quarter variations (Chart 1). There are uncertainties surrounding this inflation path emanating from recent unseasonal rains, the likely spatial and temporal distribution of monsoon, the low reservoir levels by historical averages, and the strength of the recent upturn in commodity prices, especially oil. The persistence of inflation in certain services warrants watching, while the implementation of the 7th Central Pay Commission awards will impart an upside to the baseline through direct and indirect effects. On the other hand, there will be some offsetting downside pressures stemming from tepid demand in the global economy, Government¡¯s effective supply side measures keeping a check on food prices, and the Central Government¡¯s commendable commitment to fiscal consolidation. The uneven recovery in growth in 2015-16 is likely to strengthen gradually into 2016-17, assuming a normal monsoon, the likely boost to consumption demand from the implementation of the 7th Pay Commission recommendations and OROP, and continuing monetary policy accommodation. After two consecutive years of deficient monsoon, a normal monsoon would work as a favourable supply shock, strengthening rural demand and augmenting the supply of farm products that also influence inflation. On the other hand, the fading impact of lower input costs on value addition in manufacturing, persisting corporate sector stress and risk aversion in the banking system, and the weaker global growth and trade outlook could impart a downside to growth outcomes going forward. The GVA growth projection for 2016-17 is accordingly retained at 7.6 per cent, with risks evenly balanced around it (Chart 2)."

drought,"Lake Velence, a shallow, freshwater lake in central Hungary, is a haven for over 100 types of birds, dozens of species of fish and throngs of tourists who come to bathe in its waters for relief from the hot summers.
But many of the lake’s visitors, both animal and human, have disappeared as extreme heat has brought the water to dangerously low levels, something activists and environmental experts say threatens the country’s third largest natural lake with an economic and ecological crisis.
They say climate change and insufficient infrastructure are colliding, with devastating effect. The lake has lost nearly half of its water in the past two years as hot, dry summers have led to accelerating evaporation and deteriorating water quality.
“We are talking about years of rainfall deficit, drought and a continuous water shortage,” said environmental management engineer and activist Tibor Horanyi. “For years we’ve seen what role global warming is playing in our lives, and it’s clearly connected to this low water level.”
The optimal water level for Lake Velence (pronounced ’VEH-len-tseh) in August is 150 centimeters (5 feet), according to the local water authority.
But on Thursday, the water level stood at 80 centimeters (2 feet 7 inches), an amount of water that Horanyi called “critical.”
Hot, dry weather can result in as much as 1 centimeter per day evaporating from Lake Velence, according to official measurements. Those decreased levels have meant water temperatures are rising faster, causing diminished oxygen content, increased proliferation of algae and reduced water quality.
Following a long, cold spring, Hungary experienced its third hottest June since 1901 and then the hottest July on record, according to the national meteorological service.
The extreme heat caused the water temperature in the lake to rise by 10 degrees Celsius (18 F) within a week in June, Horanyi said, resulting in the death of more than four tonnes (8,800 pounds) of fish that were then removed by volunteers.
Otto Balogh, a local fisherman, told The Associated Press that the conditions in the water were clearly visible, and had impacted his catch."
wildfires,"Hundreds of firefighters yesterday battled a forest blaze which forced 2,000 people to evacuate their homes in the Spanish region of Valencia, officials said.
Authorities said late yesterday that the fire had ravaged 5,500 hectares of land since it broke out on Sunday and 800 personnel were working into the night to put it out.
The regional emergency services said in online updates that the fire had been “stabilised” and roads that were closed for safety earlier would start being reopened.
The fire broke out Sunday afternoon and spread quickly, fanned by strong winds and sustained by high temperatures.
It threatened six villages about 50 kilometres inland of the eastern city of Valencia, which lies on the Mediterranean coast.
“The village itself was not harmed but all the hills as far as you can see from the village have been burned,” Manolo Causera, deputy mayor of one of the villages, Gestalgar, told AFP.
About 2,000 people were evacuated from six villages in the area and several roads were cut off, Valencia officials said.
Thirty-one water-dumping aircraft doused water on woodland around villages such as Bugarra as bright flames devoured the dry vegetation, sending up thick grey smoke.
Enrique Silvestre, mayor of another of the evacuated villages, Chulilla, said earlier Monday that the situation was “very difficult”."

There has been some recovery in world trade and most of the major economies now look to be expanding. The risk aversion that was so evident earlier in the year, particularly in financial markets, has abated and confidence is gradually returning.Asia is at the forefront of the global recovery. The region's financial systems have not experienced the same dislocation as elsewhere, and the economies are benefiting from a recovery in domestic demand, underpinned by stimulatory settings of both monetary and fiscal policy. Growth in China and India has been particularly strong."
drought,"One northwestern New Mexico city is trying to curb water use as the region deals with persistent drought.
The Farmington City Council passed a resolution Tuesday enacting a water shortage advisory that calls for residents to cut their use by 10%. The advisory will remain in place until further notice.
Lake Farmington supplies the city with drinking water and is fed by the Animas and San Juan rivers. City officials say low stream flows and the likelihood of continued dryness will prevent the community’s water supplies from being replenished so they’re trying to lower overall demand on the system.
The latest map shows severe to extreme drought centered over the area. All but a tiny sliver in northeastern New Mexico is grappling with some form of drought, making for a worse situation than just three months ago and much worse than the same period last year.
Some parts of the state received much needed rain and snow overnight Tuesday, but forecasters are expecting below normal precipitation later this fall.
The city of Farmington is urging residents to take shorter showers and not let the water run when brushing teeth or shaving. They’re also asking people to limit outdoor watering to certain hours, repair any leaks immediately and refrain from washing vehicles at home."

By the afternoon, the subtropical depression took on tropical characteristics and was renamed Dolly. NASA’s Terra satellite greeted Tropical Storm Dolly by taking an image of the new tropical storm. At 1 p.m. EDT (1700 UTC), the National Hurricane Center (NHC) classified Dolly as a tropical storm. The NHC Discussion said, “A (9:48 a.m. EDT) 1348 UTC an ASCAT-A scatterometer [a satellite instrument that measures wind speed and direction] pass, arriving just after the previous advisory was issued, indicates that the cyclone is producing winds of 35 to 40 knots (40 to 46 mph/65 to 74 kph) in its southern semicircle. In addition, the radius of maximum winds has contracted to about 40 nautical miles. This, along with the current convective pattern, suggests that the system has made a transition from a subtropical to a tropical cyclone, and it has been designated as Tropical Storm Dolly.”"
other,"I will now turn to monetary policy. The Congress has assigned us the goals of promoting maximum employment and stable prices. Over the second half of 2017, the FOMC continued to gradually reduce monetary policy accommodation. Specifically, we raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point at our December meeting, bringing the target to a range of 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent. In addition, in October we initiated a balance sheet normalization program to gradually reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings. That program has been proceeding smoothly. These interest rate and balance sheet actions reflect the Committee's view that gradually reducing monetary policy accommodation will sustain a strong labor market while fostering a return of inflation to 2 percent.In gauging the appropriate path for monetary policy over the next few years, the FOMC will continue to strike a balance between avoiding an overheated economy and bringing PCE price inflation to 2 percent on a sustained basis. While many factors shape the economic outlook, some of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds: In particular, fiscal policy has become more stimulative and foreign demand for U.S. exports is on a firmer trajectory. Despite the recent volatility, financial conditions remain accommodative. At the same time, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer-run objective. In the FOMC's view, further gradual increases in the federal funds rate will best promote attainment of both of our objectives. As always, the path of monetary policy will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.In evaluating the stance of monetary policy, the FOMC routinely consults monetary policy rules that connect prescriptions for the policy rate with variables associated with our mandated objectives. Personally, I find these rule prescriptions helpful. Careful judgments are required about the measurement of the variables used, as well as about the implications of the many issues these rules do not take into account. I would like to note that this Monetary Policy Report provides further discussion of monetary policy rules and their role in the Federal Reserve's policy process, extending the analysis we introduced in July."
Typhoon,"U.S. forecasters say Hurricane Iota has strengthened to a catastrophic Category 5 storm as it nears landfall with Nicaragua.
In its latest report, the National Hurricane Center says Iota is closing in on Nicaragua, where it is expected to bring “catastrophic winds, life-threatening storm surge, and torrential rainfall.”
Iota, currently packing maximum sustained winds of 260 kilometers per hour, is expected to make landfall in almost the exact location where Hurricane Eta came ashore two weeks ago.
Authorities in Honduras and Nicaragua rushed to evacuate their respective citizens from coastal areas Monday ahead of the storm.
""What's drawing closer is a bomb,"" Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez said at a news conference alongside Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei.
Hurricane Eta killed at least 50 people, destroyed buildings, knocked out power and caused flooding and landslides.
Iota is the record-breaking 30th named storm of the 2020 hurricane season. Along with Eta, it marks the first time that two major hurricanes have formed in the month of November.
It is also the 10th named storm to strengthen by more than 55.5 kph in a 24-hour period. Meteorologists attribute the effect to warm waters in the southern Caribbean."

Real GDP growth is expected to slow sharply to 0.5-1.5% this year.  Recovery in 2002 will depend on an upturn in external demand, particularly of the global electronics industry.  At the same time inflationary pressures are subsiding.  However, the slowdown reflects a decline in demand, not an erosion of competitiveness.  There is no reason for any persistent weakening of the Singapore dollar.MAS has therefore shifted to a neutral exchange rate policy stance, with a policy band centred on a zero percent appreciation of the S$NEER.

earthquake,"A magnitude 5.9 earthquake has struck southwestern Iran along the Persian Gulf.
There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries from the temblor Sunday.
Iranian state television alerted on its broadcast, saying it was a 5.9 magnitude. A second aftershock quake of 4.5 magnitude followed it.
The US Geological Survey called it a 5.8 magnitude earthquake, located at the port city of Bandar Genaveh. It described its depth at 10 kilometers (6.2 miles).
A magnitude 5 earthquake can cause considerable damage. Such shallow earthquakes as Sunday's also have broader damage.
That's some 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant.
Iran is on major seismic faults and experiences one earthquake a day on average. In 2003, a magnitude 6.6 earthquake flattened the historic city of Bam, killing 26,000 people.

drought,"Sixty-six percent of the state is now in a drought, the highest percentage of any U.S. state, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. Parts of the state north of Lake Okeechobee are now enduring ""extreme"" drought, the second-worst level.
If the drought persists — which is expected — this could mean major crop and pasture losses, as well as widespread water shortages and restrictions, the Drought Monitor said. Burn bans, which prohibit the burning of yard debris, campfires, and bonfires, have already been issued across the state.
The drought has escalated dramatically since early February, when none of the state was in a drought.
Across the country, Florida's drought is the exception: Less than 5% of the U.S. is now in a drought, the lowest percentage in at least the past 17 years. Only Florida and a portion of northern Georgia are seeing extreme drought.
Not surprisingly, the drought is due to an ongoing lack of rainfall. ""Drier than normal conditions have persisted for several months"" in Florida, the National Weather Service said. Many Florida cities have seen far less rain than usual this year. Tampa has only seen about 5 inches of rain, compared to an average of about 10 inches.
Many other cities, including Jacksonville, Daytona, Orlando, Melbourne, and Fort Myers have all seen below-average rainfall so far in 2017, according to data from the weather service."

Riding on the favourable monsoon, the outlook for agriculture remains bright, with rabi sowing up 4.0 per cent from the acreage covered at this time last year under supportive soil moisture and reservoir conditions.CPI inflation rose sharply to 7.3 per cent in September and further to 7.6 per cent in October 2020, with some evidence that price pressures are spreading. Food inflation surged to double digits in October across protein-rich items including pulses, edible oils, vegetables and spices on multiple supply shocks. Core inflation, i.e., CPI excluding food and fuel, also picked up from 5.4 per cent in September to 5.8 per cent in October. Both three months and one year ahead inflation expectations of households have eased modestly in anticipation of the seasonal moderation of food prices in the winter and easing of supply chain disruptions.Domestic financial conditions remained easy in October-November and systemic liquidity continued to be in large surplus. Reserve money increased by 15.3 per cent (y-o-y) (as on November 27, 2020), driven by a surge in currency demand. Money supply (M3), on the other hand, grew by only 12.5 per cent as on November 20, 2020. A noteworthy development is that non-food credit growth accelerated and moved into positive territory for the first time in November 2020 on a financial year basis _ hitherto, the large inflow of deposits into the banking system was being predominantly deployed in SLR investment. Corporate bond issuances stood at _4.4 lakh crore during April-October 2020 as against _3.5 lakh crore during the same period last year. India¡¯s foreign exchange reserves were US$ 574.8 billion (as on November 27), up from US$ 545.6 billion on October 2 at the time of the MPC¡¯s last resolution."
other,"Government final consumption expenditure (GFCE) provided sustained support to aggregate demand in H2:2017-18, picking up in Q3:2017-18 on top of the front-loading of expenditure by the central government in Q1:2017-18. GFCE will likely continue to augment aggregate demand going forward into 2018-19, in view of the deviation of 0.3 per cent of GDP from the path of fiscal consolidation announced in the Union Budget (Table III.2). The gross fiscal deficit (GFD) target of 3.0 per cent of GDP has been deferred to 2020-21.In 2017-18 (April-February), there was a deterioration in the fiscal position of the central government on account of a sharp increase in expenditure combined with a decline in non-tax revenue relative to budget estimates. Revenue expenditure has evolved as budgeted, although payments under food and petroleum subsidies have been higher than a year ago. In the revised estimates for 2017-18, the outgo on account of major subsidies was estimated at 1.4 per cent of GDP, up from 1.3 per cent in 2016-17.Various categories of revenue expenditure take the form of committed payments with little room for cutbacks. Meanwhile, capital expenditure rose by 38.3 per cent up to February and constituted 108.6 per cent of the revised estimates (which were revised downwards from the budget estimates for the year). Accordingly, to meet the revised estimates, budgetary adjustments in the remaining part of the year might not involve any capex reduction, which has been stepped up over a wide area comprising civil aviation, defence, heavy industry, petroleum & natural gas, railways, shipping and road transport, including highways."
other,"Overall, global economic growth appears to have been close to average in recent months, having been a bit below average earlier in the year. The Chinese economy has been growing at around the same pace as seen earlier in the year, which on an annualised basis is a bit below the authorities' stated target of 7.5 per cent. Growth of total financing in China, which was very strong earlier in the year, looks to have slowed amid authorities' concerns about the strength of non-bank financing. In Japan, the adoption of more expansionary monetary and fiscal policies has seen the exchange rate depreciate significantly since the end of last year and has supported strong growth of the economy this year. In the rest of east Asia, weaker external demand is weighing on growth but domestic demand has remained relatively resilient. The US economic recovery is proceeding at a moderate pace, notwithstanding the effects of fiscal consolidation. In contrast, economic activity remains weak in the euro area. Globally, inflation pressures have eased over the past year and monetary policy has remained highly accommodative in most economies.The outlook for the global economy is a little softer than at the time of the May Statement. World GDP growth is expected to remain close to average over the rest of this year, but with annual average growth around 3 per cent for 2013 reflecting weaker growth around the turn of the year. Growth is then expected to pick up, to be slightly above average in 2014. Economic growth is expected to be stronger for Australia's major trading partners than for the world as a whole. The slightly weaker outlook than a few months ago reflects, among other things, the assessment that growth in China is now unlikely to pick up much, if at all, in coming quarters. Rather, it is expected to remain at a pace that is close to the official target."
earthquake,"A magnitude-5.6 earthquake occurred in southwestern Iceland at about 1005 Feb. 24. The epicenter was approximately 4 km (2.5 miles) east-northeast of Grindavik and 37 km (23 miles) southeast of Reykjavik. The tremor occurred at a depth of about 10 km (6 miles), and moderate-to-strong shaking was probably felt close to the epicenter in far southwestern Iceland. Weak-to-light shaking was likely felt across western Iceland. There have been no initial reports of damage or casualties as a result of the earthquake; however, damage is possible near the epicenter. It could take several hours until authorities can conduct comprehensive
 damage assessments, especially in remote areas. Aftershocks are likely over the coming days.Officials may temporarily shut down transportation infrastructure in the tremor zone to check for damage. Minor disruptions could occur during shutdowns, but service will likely resume quickly if no damage is found. Utility outages are possible, particularly near the earthquake's epicenter."
earthquake,"Quake of magnitude 7.3 hits Papua New Guinea, tsunami warning briefly issued A warning for ""hazardous tsunami waves"" was briefly issued for coastal regions within 300 kilometers of Wau in Papua New Guinea's northeast, after a 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck the region, the US Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said. The quake struck about 12.50pm local time at a depth of 85 km according to the US Geological Survey (USGS), and struck offshore 18 kms east-southeast of Wau. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center initially issued a tsunami warning but said about an hour later the danger had passed. There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage and the PNG National Disaster Centre declined to comment until it had received a briefing. Wau is an inland former gold mining town with a population of about 5,000, about 150 kms southwest of PNG's second-largest city, Lae. A person who answered the phone at the Lae City Hotel said they the had felt the quake but there was no property damage. ""It's normal, the earthquake, here. The staff is okay. They just kept on going,"" the person said. The hotel was fully booked but all the guests were out at the time of the quake, the person added."
earthquake,"Japan's most powerful earthquake since records began has struck the north-east coast, triggering a massive tsunami.
Cars, ships and buildings were swept away by a wall of water after the 8.9-magnitude tremor, which struck about 400km (250 miles) north-east of Tokyo.
A state of emergency has been declared at a nuclear power plant, where pressure has exceeded normal levels.
Officials say 350 people are dead and about 500 missing, but it is feared the final death toll will be much higher.
In one ward alone in Sendai, a port city in Miyagi prefecture, 200 to 300 bodies were found.
The quake was the fifth-largest in the world since 1900 and nearly 8,000 times stronger than the one which devastated Christchurch, New Zealand, last month, said scientists.
Thousands of people living near the Fukushima nuclear power plant have been ordered to evacuate.
Japanese nuclear officials said pressure inside a boiling water reactor at the plant was running much higher than normal after the cooling system failed.
Officials said they might need to deliberately release some radioactive steam to relieve pressure, but that there would be no health risk.
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had earlier said the US Air Force had flown emergency coolant to the site.
But US officials later said no coolant had been handed over because the Japanese had decided to handle the situation themselves.
The UN's nuclear agency said four nuclear power plants had shut down safely.
Measured at 8.9 by the US Geological Survey, it struck at 1446 local time (0546 GMT) at a depth of about 24km.
The tsunami rolled across the Pacific at 800km/h (500mph) - as fast as a jetliner - before hitting Hawaii and the US West Coast, but there were no reports of major damage from those regions.
Thousands of people were ordered to evacuate coastal areas in the states of California, Oregon and Washington.
The biggest waves of more than 6-7ft (about 2m) were recorded near California's Crescent City, said the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre.
A tsunami warning extended across the Pacific to North and South America, where many other coastal regions were evacuated, but the alert was later lifted in most parts, including the Philippines, Australia and China.
Strong waves hit Japan's Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures, damaging dozens of coastal communities.
A 10m wave struck Sendai, deluging farmland and sweeping cars across the airport's runway. Fires broke out in the centre of the city."

A total of 45 people were rescued from ruins, and search and rescue operations are still going on in the debris of one building at the city center, the AFAD said in an updated statement. The earthquake occurred at 8:55 p.m. local time (1755 GMT) in the province of Elazig at a depth of 6.75 km and was followed by 788 aftershocks, according to the statement. The analysis of a total of 1,521 constructions in both Elazig and the nearby province of Malatya by experts revealed that at least 76 buildings were fully wrecked, and 645 others were severely damaged, the AFAD added. Earlier in the day, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the problems were mostly in the villages of Elazig. ""We will detect the scope of the damage there and launch the construction works quickly,"" he told reporters in Istanbul before departing for Algeria. The AFAD statement also said that some 10,000 tents suitable for families were shipped to the region, and more than 4,200 of them were installed in line with the demand in the field. The agency also shared a couple of bank details on its website for those citizens who want to donate money for the earthquake survivors."

other,"The COVID-19 pandemic represents the largest shock to the global economy in many decades. Labour markets have been severely disrupted. While infection rates have declined in some countries, they have escalated in many others, including the United States and some large emerging market economies. Renewed outbreaks are also occurring in some other countries, including Japan and parts of Australia. The ongoing spread of the virus, and the responses to contain it, will combine to slow the recovery.The Australian economy has experienced a severe contraction and, like many other economies, is now in the early stages of recovery. The contraction over the first half of 2020 was smaller than anticipated three months ago, though it was still very large. It was also not quite as large as in some other economies, where lockdown measures were more binding and were imposed for longer. However, the pace of recovery is expected to be slower than previously forecast. Generalised uncertainty and deficiency in demand have turned out to be more of a drag on growth than previously thought. The measures taken to address the current outbreak in Victoria will further delay the recovery. The most recently announced containment measures are expected to subtract at least 2 percentage points from national growth in the September quarter, relative to the counterfactual where the renewed outbreak had not occurred."
wildfires,"More than 70 homes have been lost in a wildfire outside Australia's western city of Perth which is expected to continue burning for days.
The fire had razed more than 9,000 hectares of farm and woodland in hills east of Perth by early Wednesday, authorities said.
Western Australia state's Fire and Emergency Services Commissioner Darren Klemm said the number of houses destroyed had jumped to 71 from 59 overnight, and conditions would remain difficult for firefighters with no rain forecast until Sunday.  
""We're into Day 3 of this fire today and it's going to continue to be a challenging fire for us for at least the next three or four or five days,"" Klemm said.
Six firefighters sustained minor injuries, Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported. No other injuries were reported."
other,"Over the past year, the Federal Reserve has employed a wide array of tools to promote economic recovery and preserve price stability. The target for the federal funds rate has been maintained at a historically low range of 0 to 1/4 percent since December 2008. The FOMC continues to anticipate that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.To provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve is in the process of purchasing $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and about $175 billion of agency debt. We have been gradually slowing the pace of these purchases in order to promote a smooth transition in markets and anticipate that these transactions will be completed by the end of March. The FOMC will continue to evaluate its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.In response to the substantial improvements in the functioning of most financial markets, the Federal Reserve is winding down the special liquidity facilities it created during the crisis. On February 1, a number of these facilities, including credit facilities for primary dealers, lending programs intended to help stabilize money market mutual funds and the commercial paper market, and temporary liquidity swap lines with foreign central banks, were allowed to expire.1 The only remaining lending program for multiple borrowers created under the Federal Reserve's emergency authorities, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, is scheduled to close on March 31 for loans backed by all types of collateral except newly issued commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) and on June 30 for loans backed by newly issued CMBS.In addition to closing its special facilities, the Federal Reserve is normalizing its lending to commercial banks through the discount window. The final auction of discount-window funds to depositories through the Term Auction Facility, which was created in the early stages of the crisis to improve the liquidity of the banking system, will occur on March 8. Last week we announced that the maximum term of discount window loans, which was increased to as much as 90 days during the crisis, would be returned to overnight for most banks, as it was before the crisis erupted in August 2007. To discourage banks from relying on the discount window rather than private funding markets for short-term credit, last week we also increased the discount rate by 25 basis points, raising the spread between the discount rate and the top of the target range for the federal funds rate to 50 basis points. These changes, like the closure of most of the special lending facilities earlier this month, are in response to the improved functioning of financial markets, which has reduced the need for extraordinary assistance from the Federal Reserve. These adjustments are not expected to lead to tighter financial conditions for households and businesses and should not be interpreted as signaling any change in the outlook for monetary policy, which remains about the same as it was at the time of the January meeting of the FOMC."
drought,"As more frequent river droughts will stretch the continent’s water resources, people, and economies must find new ways to adapt.
On 1 June 2018, results showed 4.5%. One month later, it was 10.8%; almost four months later, on 20 October, about 35.9% of Europe’s rivers were flowing abnormally low, the lowest since at least 1991. A summer of little to no rain left major water systems without their much needed water; repeated heat waves were also speeding up evaporation, leading to more water loss. This year, drought was already underway in April, in a big part of Central Europe, ranging from moderate to extreme, according to data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) and in many regions the drought has continued throughout June, making 2020 the third year in a row with unexpectedly dry conditions, according to the Copernicus Emergency Management service.
In the future, this might not be such an uncommon event. Halfway through this century, droughts are predicted to become more frequent, threatening a wide range of sectors, from water and energy supply to river transport and agriculture. “The Mediterranean sub-region, already suffering most from water scarcity, is projected to experience the strongest negative effects of climate change on drought conditions,” the Joint Research Center (JRC) Droughts Team told Euronews. “With increasing global warming, streamflow deficits in this region are expected to happen more frequently, become more severe and last longer,” the JRC team said. If global temperatures rise by 3 degrees, the researchers say an additional 11 million people and 4.5 million hectares could be annually exposed to droughts that used to occur only once every 10 years or so. “We see a strong divide within Europe, with more drought in the South and less in the North,” says Dr. Niko Wanders, hydrological extremes researcher at Utrecht University. “We’re observing that extreme droughts are likely to become more severe. This is caused by a combination of higher temperatures and more evaporation that results in bigger water losses,” says Dr. Wanders.
A noticeable factor comes from the fact that rivers are also receiving less water from glaciers, according to experts at the University of Birmingham. Warming in the European Alps in the last three decades, combined with less snowfall has resulted in a little bit under a 54% loss in glacier ice area since 1850; long-term predictions show further drastic reductions.
Rivers affected by drought lose more than water depth. Less rainwater means that river waters cannot dilute pollutants efficiently; this leads to higher concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as of heavy metals and microplastics, according to experts from the MaRIUS research consortium. The organic build up boosts algal production, leading to blooms that could make the water unusable for human use. Hotter river waters also hold less oxygen than cold ones, which harms fish and other aquatic fauna."
flood,"Cyclone which caused Indonesia's devastating floods a result of global warming: Experts JAKARTA - Rising sea temperatures due to global warming were responsible for tropical cyclone Seroja, which triggered devastating floods and landslides in Indonesia's East Nusa Tenggara islands on Sunday, Indonesia's weather agency has said.  More than a hundred people lost their lives in the disaster.  The 10th cyclone to hit the country since 2008 was the strongest to date, driven by a 4 deg C spike in the temperature of the surrounding waters, Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) chief Dwikorita Karnawati said on Tuesday (April 6).  ""Seroja is the first one to bring tremendous impact because it hit the land. It's uncommon,"" she added.  Indonesia's last major tropical cyclone, Cempaka, formed in the sea in November 2017, and largely dissipated when it hit landfall."

At 10:00 a.m., the Alberta government reported 116 fires burning in the province, 34 of them out of control. The following day, the total number of fires had dropped to 100, and the number of uncontrolled fires had dropped to 22. But four new fires had started to burn out of control.
The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Terra satellite took this image at 12:35 p.m. local time on May 16. Similar images of central Canada are available twice daily.
The top image shows a wide area to illustrate how far the smoke traveled. The lower image provides a closer view of a massive fire burning south of Lake Athabasca. Fire detections are outlined in red. Strong winds fanned the fires on May 15 and 16, sending thick plumes of smoke to the north.
The fires forced some energy and transportation companies to suspend operations, reported CBC News. Multiple oil and gas companies suspended drilling and moved their employees to safety. Oil transport was also hampered by a shutdown of rail service and a pipeline closure. Meanwhile, fires near Lesser Slave Lake destroyed 40 percent of the nearby town on May 15, including hundreds of homes and businesses and the town hall.
On May 17, CBC News reported that British Columbia was sending 200 more firefighters, in addition to the 130 firefighters already deployed to Alberta. Fire danger remained extreme throughout much of northern Alberta on May 17, the government reported."

wildfires,"The object in the sky is an aircraft flying around the fire in a circle. It is the Air Attack plane, or the spotter/lead plane that flies over the fire to watch its progress, map it, and relay the information to firefighters on the ground. At that point in the evening they must have had the autopilot on or set the aircraft so it was flying in perfect circles. The blinking navigation lights created the pattern that you see in the circle.
Intense wildfires have been surging across southern and northern California with little reprieve for firefighters or residents for several weeks. The intensity of the flames has increased because of the sudden heat wave sweeping into peak wildfire season. Last week fires burned over 250 acres across the Sierra Nevada foothills, and over 70,000 acres have been burned east of Sacramento by what’s being called the King fire, forcing thousands to flee their homes.
In Sight spoke with photographer Stuart Palley who grew up in southern California and has spent the past several years following and photographing these chaotic wildfires in beautiful, majestic ways. Palley immersed himself in extensive training both physically and in the classroom before venturing out with his camera equipment and personal fire gear. Though he’s made himself known in the firefighting community, Palley generally ventures out and photographs wildfires on his own. “I am almost always in sight of firefighters or with them if they pull to a safety zone, but it’s still a calculated risk and there’s some danger at each fire, but it pales in comparison to the risks and dangers those on the line for days at a time take,” he said."

earthquake,"Very strong mag. 6.8 earthquake - Near East Coast of Honshu, Japan, on Saturday, 1 May 2021 at 01:27 (GMT) - information A large quake of magnitude 6.8 struck northeast Japan this morning, but seems to have caused no significant damage or injuries, thanks to the country's excellent building standards and preparedness for large quakes. No tsunami alert was issued - fortunately, the quake was too deep and the mechanism of the faulting that occurred did not trigger any significant waves. Along a 100 km stretch of the coast near Sendai, people experienced strong shaking (VI on the Mercalli scale). Beyond the area of strong shaking, it was felt more lightly in up to several hundreds km distance, over large parts of Japan. Our monitoring service received numerous reports from people all over Honshu who felt it within minutes after the quake struck. Most people described horizontal ground movements that lasted 10-20 seconds, depending on the distance from the epicenter, suggesting that it was mainly the secondary (side-wise swinging) earthquake waves that reached the country's interior. Especially central eastern Honshu, large earthquakes are no strangers: Today's quake occurred only 40 km SE of the magnitude 7 earthquake on 20 March this year, a similar one in February, and 70 km west of the catastrophic Tohoku quake on 11 March 2011, infamous for the large tsunami and following nuclear disaster at Fukushima. Japan's bullet train (Shinkansen) services were temporarily suspended throughout northern Japan, in order to check for possible damages to the rail systems by the quake. As of time of this update, the services in Kanto and Tohoku areas are still on hold. For updated information, please visit the website of the East Japan Rail website. Some power plants and oil processing refineries shot down temporarily as precaution as well, but reported no damages and have been restarting their operations."

other,"Global financial markets have remained buoyant, reflecting the improving economic outlook and the gradual normalisation of monetary policy by the US Fed. Equity markets have gained on improved corporate earnings and anticipation of large tax cuts in the US. Although equity markets have made gains in EMEs in general, they faced risk aversion in some economies. While bond yields in most AEs have moved sideways in the absence of inflation pressures, they have risen across most EMEs on country-specific factors. In currency markets, the US dollar has gained, while the surge in the euro on positive economic data lost some momentum in November due to political uncertainty. Several emerging market currencies weakened due to domestic factors. Capital inflows to EMEs have been differentiating among countries, based on investor perceptions of risk-return trade-offs.On the domestic front, the growth of real gross value added (GVA) accelerated sequentially in Q2 of 2017-18, after five consecutive quarters of deceleration. It was powered by a sharp acceleration in industrial activity. All the three sub-sectors of industry registered higher growth. GVA growth in the manufacturing sector _ the key component of industry _ accelerated sharply on improved demand and re-stocking post goods and services tax (GST) implementation. The mining sector expanded in Q2 due to higher coal and natural gas production. GVA growth in the electricity, gas, water supply and other utility services sector also strengthened on higher demand. In contrast, growth in agriculture and allied activities slackened, reflecting the lower than expected kharif harvest. Activity in the services sector decelerated, mainly on account of slowdown in financial, insurance, real estate and professional services, and in public administration, defence and other services (PADO) following the large front-loading of government expenditure in Q1. Despite some improvement, construction sector growth remained tepid due to transitory effects of the RERA and GST implementation. Growth in the trade, hotels, transport and communication sub-group remained resilient, in spite of some slowdown in growth in Q2 as compared with the previous quarter. On the expenditure side, the growth of gross fixed capital formation improved for the second successive quarter. However, growth in private final consumption expenditure _ the mainstay of aggregate demand _ slowed to an eight-quarter low in Q2."

other,"Combating the spread of COVID-19 has required severe restrictions on economic activity in many countries. The result has been a large and near-simultaneous contraction across the global economy. Heightened uncertainty about the future has exacerbated the contraction, both directly through weaker investment and consumer spending and via tighter financial conditions. In Australia, output is expected to contract significantly over the first half of 2020, mostly in the June quarter. While the exact size of the contraction is still uncertain, a decline in GDP of around 10 per cent from peak to trough is expected.The contractions in output in many other economies are likely to be at least as large as that in Australia; the size and timing of these declines depend both on the duration of the containment measures and on how stringent these measures have needed to be. March quarter GDP data for a number of economies show significant contractions, even though in many cases the lockdowns only began in the last few weeks of the quarter."

More than 26 per cent of the island is experiencing a severe drought and another 60 per cent is under a moderate drought, according to the US Drought Monitor.
From 3 July Puerto Rico's utilities company is strictly rationing nearly 140,000 clients water supply and they will be without water for 24 hours every other day.
The company has urged residents not to stockpile water and to maintain social distancing and wear masks if retrieving water from trucks on the island.
“We're asking people to please use moderation,” said Doriel Pagan, executive director of Puerto Rico's Water and Sewer Authority, adding that she could not say how long the rationing measures will last.
Gov Wanda Vazquez confirmed that 21 of 78 municipalities are affected by the severe drought while another 29 by the moderate drought.
Under the administrative order residents in most areas will be prohibited from excessive use of water such as watering gardens during daylight hours, filling pools, and using a hose or non-recycled water to wash cars.
Those who disregard the order face fines from 250 for residents to 2,500 for industries for a first violation."
other,"A review of the existing facilities for hedging of foreign exchange risk by non-residents and residents was announced in the Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies in the Monetary Policy Statements in February 2018 and August 2018, respectively. The said review has been undertaken.Post review, a draft of the revised directions is being put in the public domain for seeking comments. The draft directions propose to, inter alia, merge the facilities for residents and non-residents into a single unified facility for all users, allow users having valid underlying exposure to hedge flexibly using any instrument of their choice, introduce the ability to hedge anticipated exposure to foreign exchange risk, and simplify the procedures for authorised dealers to offer foreign exchange derivatives. The draft circular on the revised guidelines will be released by the end of February 2019.In view of offshore interest in the Indian Rupee, the Reserve Bank¡¯s policy efforts have been to align incentives for non-residents to gradually move to the domestic market for their hedging requirements. At the same time, there is a need to improve residents¡¯ access to derivatives markets to hedge their currency risks. In order to take forward the process of gradual opening up of the foreign exchange market and also to benefit from a wider range of participants and views, it is proposed to set up a Task Force on Offshore Rupee Markets. The Task Force will examine the issues relating to the offshore Rupee markets in depth and recommend appropriate policy measures that also factor in the requirement of ensuring the stability of the external value of the Rupee. Further details about the composition and terms of reference of the Task Force shall be issued separately by the end of February 2019."
other,"Global growth picked up modestly in the second half of 2016, after weakening in the first half. Activity in advanced economies (AEs) improved hesitantly, led by a rebound in the US. In the emerging market economies (EMEs), growth has moderated, but policy stimulus in China and some easing of stress in the larger commodity exporters shored up momentum. World trade is beginning to emerge out of a trough that bottomed out in July-August and shows signs of stabilising. Inflation has ticked up in some AEs, though well below target, and is easing in several EMEs. Expectations of reflationary fiscal policies in the US, Japan and China, and the waning of downward pressures on EMEs in recession are tempered by still-prevalent political risks in the euro area and the UK, emerging geo-political risks and the spectre of financial market volatility.International financial markets were strongly impacted by the result of the US presidential election and incoming data that raised the probability of the Federal Reserve tightening monetary policy. As bouts of volatility fuelled a risk-off surge into US equities and out of fixed income markets, a risk-on stampede pulled out capital flows from EMEs, plunging their currencies and equity markets to recent lows even as bond yields hardened in tandem with US yields. The surge of the US dollar from late October intensified after the election results and triggered sizable depreciations in currencies around the world. Commodity prices firmed up across the board from mid-November on an improvement in the outlook for demand following the US election results, barring gold which lost its safe haven glitter to the ascendant US dollar. Crude prices have firmed after the OPEC¡¯s decision to cut output."
flood,"Mumbai: BJP targets BMC, Uddhav over waterlogging in city BJP has slammed Shiv Sena ruled BMC and Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray after water logging in many areas in Greater Mumbai following the first rains. BJP legislator Ashish Shelar alleged that there has been a Rs 1,000 crore scam in the last five year in the works relating to the cleaning of nullahs and other measures undertaken to avoid water logging during monsoon. Further, BJP took a dig at Thackeray saying that he will now blame the Modi government for water logging in the city.  Leader of Opposition in the state council Pravin Darekar questioned whether BMC or CM is responsible for the water logging in the city.  Shelar said, ‘’ In the first rains only the transactions of cut commission got exposed. BMC also stands exposed on its claim of 104% or 107% completion of nala cleaning/stormwater drain's pre-monsoon cleaning. It was further claimed that Mumbai will not flood this monsoon. Despite spending Rs 5,000 crore in last five years, there was flooding.’’"

other,"Moving on to the domestic economy, the first advance estimates (FAE) released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on January 7, 2020 placed India¡¯s real gross domestic product (GDP) growth for 2019-20 at 5.0 per cent. In its January 31 release, the NSO revised real GDP growth for 2018-19 to 6.1 per cent from 6.8 per cent given in the provisional estimates of May 2019. On the supply side, growth of real gross value added (GVA) is estimated at 4.9 per cent in 2019-20 as compared with 6.0 per cent in 2018-19.Turning to more recent indicators, both production and imports of capital goods _ two key pointers of investment activity _ continued to contract in November/December, though at a moderate pace compared with the previous month. Revenue expenditure of the Centre (excluding interest payments and subsidies) remained robust in Q3, indicative of the counter-cyclical buffer to domestic demand being provided by government final consumption. As per revised estimates given in the Union Budget, growth in revenue expenditure of the Centre (excluding interest payments and subsidies) is estimated to be lower in Q4 compared with Q3.On the supply side, rabi sowing has been higher by 9.5 per cent up to January 31, 2020 compared with a year ago. The north east monsoon rainfall was above normal. Storage in major reservoirs _ the main source of irrigation during the rabi season _ was 70 per cent of the full reservoir level (as on January 30, 2020) as compared with 45 per cent a year ago. Based on the first advance estimates, horticulture production is estimated to have risen 0.8 per cent to a record level in 2019-20. Production of vegetables is estimated to have increased by 2.6 per cent in 2019-20 due to higher production of onions, potatoes and tomatoes. Industrial activity, measured by the index of industrial production (IIP), improved in November after contracting in the previous three months. The output of core industries returned to positive territory in December after four months of contraction, buoyed by five out of eight of its constituents _ coal; refinery products; fertilisers; steel; and cement. Capacity utilisation (CU) in the manufacturing sector, measured by the Reserve Bank¡¯s order books, inventory and capacity utilisation survey (OBICUS), fell to 69.1 per cent in Q2 from 73.6 per cent in Q1; seasonally adjusted CU also eased to 70.3 per cent from 73.4 per cent. The Reserve Bank¡¯s industrial outlook survey points to weak demand conditions facing the manufacturing sector in Q3:2019-20. The Reserve Bank¡¯s business expectations index suggests an improvement in Q4. This is corroborated by the manufacturing purchasing managers¡¯ index (PMI) for January 2020 which picked up sharply to 55.3 from 51.2 in November 2019 on the back of increased output and new orders.Several high frequency indicators of services have turned upwards in the recent period, pointing to a modest revival in momentum, although the outlook is still muted. Amongst indicators of rural demand, while tractor sales grew by 2.4 per cent in December after ten months of a decline, motorcycle sales continued to contract. Domestic air passenger traffic _ an indicator of urban demand _ posted double digit growth in November, followed by a modest growth in December. Growth in three-wheeler sales and railway freight traffic has accelerated, while port traffic turned around in December. On the other hand, passenger vehicle sales continued to contract. The PMI services index improved to 55.5 in January 2020 from 52.7 in November 2019, boosted by a rise in new business and output.Retail inflation, measured by year-on-year changes in the CPI, surged from 4.6 per cent in October to 5.5 per cent in November and further to 7.4 per cent in December 2019, the highest reading since July 2014. While food group inflation rose to double digits, the fuel group moved out of deflation. Inflation in CPI excluding food and fuel continued to edge up from its October trough.CPI food inflation increased from 6.9 per cent in October to 12.2 per cent in December, primarily caused by a spike in onion prices due to unseasonal rains in October-November. Excluding onions, food inflation would have been lower by 4.7 percentage points and headline inflation by 2.1 percentage points in December. In addition, inflation in several other food sub-groups such as milk, pulses, cereals, edible oils, eggs, meat and fish also firmed up."
flood,"More than 100 dead in Indonesia, Timor-Leste floods, dozens missing Tropical cyclone Seroja pounded Indonesia and Timor-Leste on Monday (Apr 5) after torrential rains triggered floods and landslides that have killed at least 113 people and left dozens more missing.  Packing heavy winds and rain, the storm heaped more misery on the Southeast Asian nations after Sunday's disaster turned small communities into wastelands of mud, uprooted trees and forced thousands of people into shelters.  Downpours are expected over the next day as the storm triggers offshore waves as high as six metres, Indonesia's disaster agency said.  The cyclone, which was picking up strength as it moved towards the west coast of Australia, hampered efforts to reach trapped survivors.  At least 86 people have been killed in Indonesia, with another 71 missing, while 27 have died in Timor-Leste, a tiny half-island nation of 1.3 million that lies between Indonesia and Australia."
Typhoon,"China issued its top warning for coastal areas of Zhejiang province Friday ahead of a strong typhoon carrying heavy rain and winds and expected to send an intense storm surge up the mighty Yangzte River.
Heavy rain was expected in Zhejiang, Shanghai and nearby provinces on Friday before Typhoon Lekima hits land on Saturday morning, then weakens as it moves north.
Parts of northern Taiwan closed offices and suspended classes at schools on Friday as the storm passed northeast of the island. The same area was hit by a magnitude 6.0 earthquake Thursday that caused minor damage but no deaths or injuries.
The red alert China issued is the most serious in its four-tired alert system, prompting authorities to prepare evacuations, suspend train and air travel and require vessels to return to port. In Zhejiang, ferry service had been cancelled and more than 200 tourists evacuated from popular Beiji island.
The National Meteorological Center said Lekima was gusting at 209 kph (130 mph) and traveling northwesterly at 13 kph (8 mph). Taiwan’s Central Weather Bureau put its sustained winds at 173 kph (108 mph) and said the bands of wind and rains around the storm’s eye were shrinking.
The State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters warned authorities overseeing seven provinces including Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangsu and Shanghai Municipality to make preparations and have emergency response systems ready to be deployed. In Zhejiang, nearly 5,000 fishing boats had been recalled to port, authorities reported.
An intense storm surge was expected to raise waters in the estuary of the Yangzte River, China’s mightiest, beginning Friday. Three main streams of the Yangzte River are likely to exceed alert levels and the commission overseeing the river for the Ministry of Water Resources has ordered efforts to prevent floods and oversaturation of levees along the river’s banks."

drought,"The unprecedented drought that has gripped the Southwest United States has severely depleted the Sierra Nevada snowpack, the major source of water for drinking and farming in California. Researchers and water managers thought this past winter’s monster El Niño would bring enough rainfall to help ease the strain on water resources, but whether El Niño rains were enough to replenish the dwindling snowpack remained to be seen.
Here Margulis et al. calculated daily estimates of this winter’s snowpack volume in the Sierra Nevada using data from Landsat satellites and snow survey data collected by California’s Department of Water Resources. The team also used the satellite images and historical measurements of the snowpack and of past El Niños to estimate the snowpack’s total volume for each year from 1951 to 2015.
The researchers found that this winter’s strong El Niño did not bring enough rain to replenish the snowpack’s depleted stores. In 2015, the water volume of the snowpack was just 2.9 cubic kilometers (0.7 cubic mile), whereas a typical year is about 18.6 cubic kilometers (4.46 cubic miles), according to the study. Accounting for the 4-year snowpack deficit from the 2012–2015 drought, the researchers conclude it will likely take until 2019 for the snowpack to return to predrought levels, even if there are above-average precipitation years.
The team suggest that their method, which provides unprecedented detail and precision, could be useful in characterizing snowpack water in other mountain ranges, including the Andes and the Himalayas. These areas currently have much less on-site monitoring than in the Sierra Nevada.
The larger goal of the research is to build a detailed, continuous picture of the historical snowpack and diagnose the primary factors that cause it to vary. This information can ultimately improve models for predicting how much water will be available from the snowpack in the future, which will inform water management decisions.

Typhoon,"NASA sees record-breaking new Tropical Storm Gonzalo strengthening The seventh named tropical cyclone of the North Atlantic Ocean has formed, and like some others this season, it has broken a record. NASA's Aqua satellite provided a look at the small record-breaker. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) reports that Gonzalo is the earliest seventh named storm on record in the Atlantic basin, beating Gert of 2005 by 2 days. Tropical Depression Seven formed on July 21 by 5 p.m. EDT in the Central North Atlantic Ocean, and by 8:50 a.m. EDT on July 22 it strengthened into a tropical storm and was renamed Gonzalo. One of the ways NASA researches tropical cyclones is using infrared data that provides temperature information. The AIRS instrument aboard NASA's Aqua satellite captured a look at those temperatures in Gonzalo and gave insight into the size of the storm and its rainfall potential. Cloud top temperatures provide information to forecasters about where the strongest storms are located within a tropical cyclone. Tropical cyclones do not always have uniform strength, and some sides have stronger sides than others. The stronger the storms, the higher they extend into the troposphere, and the colder the cloud temperatures. NASA provides that data to forecasters at NOAA's National Hurricane Center or NHC so they can incorporate it in their forecasting. On July 22 at 12:11 a.m. EDT (0411 UTC) NASA's Aqua satellite analyzed the storm using the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder or AIRS instrument. AIRS found coldest cloud top temperatures as cold as or colder than minus 63 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 53 degrees Celsius). NASA research has shown that cloud top temperatures that cold indicate strong storms that have the capability to create heavy rain."
other,"In the second bi-monthly monetary policy resolution of June 2019, CPI inflation was projected at 3.0-3.1 per cent for H1:2019-20 and 3.4-3.7 per cent for H2:2019-20, with risks broadly balanced. The actual headline inflation outcome for Q1:2019-20 at 3.1 per cent was in alignment with these projections.The baseline inflation trajectory for the next four quarters will be shaped by several factors. First, the uptick in food inflation may be sustained by price pressures in vegetables and pulses as more recent data suggest. Uneven spatial and temporal distribution of monsoon could exert some upward pressure on food items, though this risk is likely to be mitigated by the recent catch up in rainfall. Second, despite excess supply conditions, crude oil prices may likely remain volatile due to geo-political tensions in the Middle-East. Third, the outlook for CPI inflation excluding food and fuel remains soft. Manufacturing firms participating in the industrial outlook survey expect output prices to ease in Q2. Fourth, one year ahead inflation expectations of households polled by the Reserve Bank have moderated. Taking into consideration these factors and the impact of recent policy rate cuts, the path of CPI inflation is projected at 3.1 per cent for Q2:2019-20 and 3.5-3.7 per cent for H2:2019-20, with risks evenly balanced. CPI inflation for Q1:2020-21 is projected at 3.6 per cent (Chart 1).In the MPC¡¯s June resolution, real GDP growth for 2019-20 was projected at 7.0 per cent _ in the range of 6.4-6.7 per cent for H1:2019-20 and 7.2-7.5 per cent for H2 _ with risks evenly balanced. Various high frequency indicators suggest weakening of both domestic and external demand conditions. The Business Expectations Index of the Reserve Bank¡¯s industrial outlook survey shows muted expansion in demand conditions in Q2, although a decline in input costs augurs well for growth. The impact of monetary policy easing since February 2019 is also expected to support economic activity, going forward. Moreover, base effects will turn favourable in H2:2019-20. Taking into consideration the above factors, real GDP growth for 2019-20 is revised downwards from 7.0 per cent in the June policy to 6.9 per cent _ in the range of 5.8-6.6 per cent for H1:2019-20 and 7.3-7.5 per cent for H2 _ with risks somewhat tilted to the downside; GDP growth for Q1:2020-21 is projected at 7.4 per cent (Chart 2).The MPC notes that inflation is currently projected to remain within the target over a 12-month ahead horizon. Since the last policy, domestic economic activity continues to be weak, with the global slowdown and escalating trade tensions posing downside risks. Private consumption, the mainstay of aggregate demand, and investment activity remain sluggish. Even as past rate cuts are being gradually transmitted to the real economy, the benign inflation outlook provides headroom for policy action to close the negative output gap. Addressing growth concerns by boosting aggregate demand, especially private investment, assumes the highest priority at this juncture while remaining consistent with the inflation mandate."

At its meeting ending on 4 August 2021, the Committee judged that the existing stance of monetary policy remained appropriate. The MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.1%. The Committee voted unanimously for the Bank of England to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at ¡ê20 billion. The Committee voted by a majority of 7-1 for the Bank of England to continue with its existing programme of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, maintaining the target for the stock of these government bond purchases at ¡ê875 billion and so the total target stock of asset purchases at ¡ê895 billion.The Committee¡¯s updated projections for activity and inflation are set out in the accompanying August Monetary Policy Report. They assume that, despite the spread of the Delta variant, the impact of Covid on the UK economy fades further over time. They are also conditioned on the market path for interest rates."
drought,"A recent JRC article warns that the extreme drought conditions that affected central and northern Europe's 2018 spring/summer growing season could become the norm within 25 years, and calls for innovative adaptation measures to deal with extremes.
The 2018 spring and summer months were marked by a unique combination of drought conditions in central and northern Europe, and unusually wet conditions in southern Europe.
For instance, Germany was affected by a 6-month drought which lasted the whole spring and summer, while the spring was particularly wet in the Iberian Peninsula.
Both extremes affected crop yields. The droughts resulted into total reductions in the main crop yields of up to 50%.
This was partially offset by southern Europe's yield gains of up to 34%.
This juxtaposition of opposite climate anomalies  _ droughts in the Northern part of Europe and unusually wet condition in the South, sometimes referred to as the ""water seesaw"" _ was  a unique phenomenon of the last 500 years.
 Future climate projections, based on high resolution global models, show that southern Europe is less likely to experience such favourably wet conditions for crop growth in the future.
On the other hand, droughts similar to those of 2018 could become common as early as 2043."
wildfires,"South-east Australia has been hit with extreme hot weather, with temperatures of over 40C (104F) in some areas, and several bushfire warnings in place.
In Victoria, lightning strikes sparked more than 250 fires on Tuesday night, fire authorities said. A fire ban has been issued across the state.
In Melbourne, a tennis player and a ball boy at the Australian Open collapsed in the heat.
Temperatures in the city remained above 30C for much of Tuesday night.
Country Fire Authority chief officer Euan Ferguson said in a statement: ""The extreme temperatures [in Victoria] over the coming three days will test fire services and the community. It's critical we minimise the risk of any fires before Friday.""
Firefighters have been able to contain most of the fires in the state, although a number of fires remain out of control.
Emergency fire warnings have been issued for the Victoria communities of Yaapeet and Nypo, with fire authorities urging residents to evacuate due to ""a fast moving, out of control bushfire travelling in a south easterly direction"".
In 2009, fires in Victoria killed 173 people and destroyed 2,000 homes."

drought,"On June 5, it drizzled for about ten minutes over most of Marathwada in India’s western state of Maharashtra. That made headlines in the local media, because it was the first time since August 17, 2018, that anyone had seen a drop of rain in this region, the epicentre of the drought that is now afflicting almost half of India.
Two days earlier, Sakharam Landge was ploughing his farm near Umarkheda village in Jalna district. It was 42 degrees Celsius in the shade, a hot wind was blowing away the topsoil his tractor churned up, and he was not sure he would be able to sow any crop this summer. “But what else can I do,” he said. “My grandfather, my father, all the elders in the village said we must plough our farms in the first half of June, so that we can sow our Kharif (summer) crop as soon as the rains arrive on June 15.”
A farmer in his early forties, Landge is perfectly aware that the monsoon rains have not been arriving on June 15 in recent years. Of the 18 summer monsoons this millennium in Marathwada _ a region where the overwhelming majority of farmers have no irrigation facilities _ ten have caused droughts and one a flood. As the monsoon winds bring rainfall from the Arabian Sea to India’s west coast, Marathwada is also in the rain shadow of the Western Ghats _ a mountain chain along the coast _ and has always been a low rainfall area.
However, it is also home to the famously productive ‘black cotton soil’ of the Deccan Plateau. In a good rainfall year, cotton and soybean _ the two staple crops of the region in recent decades _ bring enough money to see an average farming family through for the next couple of years as well. But apart from 2016, no one has any recent memory of a good rainfall year in this region with a population of about 18.7 million people, most of whom are farmers."
other,"Retail inflation measured by year-on-year changes in the consumer price index (CPI) plunged to a historic low in April, pulled down by a large favourable base effect which overwhelmed a momentum that was feeble relative to the historical record for the month. Underlying this surprising softness was a sharp fall in food inflation brought about by a deflation in the prices of pulses and vegetables. In addition, moderation in the prices of cereals, eggs, oils and fats and spices contributed to the loss of momentum. In the case of pulses, the large-scale augmentation of supply on account of expansion in acreage, procurement, buffer stocking and imports caused a sharp decline in prices starting in August 2016. Propelled by significantly higher arrivals in mandis relative to the seasonal pattern, prices of vegetables also fell markedly from July and bottomed out in January 2017, with fire sales during the demonetisation period accentuating the fall. The seasonal uptick that typically occurs in the pre-monsoon months has been muted so far. In the fuel group by contrast, inflation surged across the board. Prices of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and kerosene rose in sympathy with international prices even as the subsidy was set on a path of calibrated reduction. Fuel used by rural households rose for the third month in succession, narrowing the wedge between fuel inflation facing rural and urban households. In response to these developments, inflation expectations three months ahead and a year ahead surveyed in the Reserve Bank¡¯s inflation expectations survey of households have ticked down marginally.Excluding food and fuel, inflation dipped 60 basis points from a month ago to 4.4 per cent. The delayed and cumulative downward adjustment of domestic petrol and diesel prices in April to the softening of international crude prices in preceding months was among the factors at work. Inflation in respect of services embedded in transport and communication, education, recreation and health also moderated. The industrial outlook survey and the PMIs for manufacturing and services indicate that pricing power remains weak.Even as surplus liquidity in the banking system post-demonetisation was drained by the ramping up of new currency in circulation by _ 1.5 trillion in April and May, massive spending by the Government re-injected liquidity into the system, raising the daily average overall surplus liquidity in the banking system to _ 4.2 trillion in April and _ 3.5 trillion in May. Unwinding of the excess reserves that banks used to dress up balance sheets for end-March also resulted in an accretion of _ 0.8 trillion to the surplus liquidity. Absorption operations undertaken by the Reserve Bank in the context of these developments and the consequent downward pressure on money market rates consisted of _ 1 trillion impounded through issuance of treasury bills (TBs) of tenors ranging from 312 days to 329 days under the market stabilisation scheme (MSS), auctions of cash management bills (CMBs) of _ 0.7 trillion triggered by the decline in cash balances of the Government, and variable rate reverse repo auctions of different tenors which took in the remaining surplus liquidity averaging _ 3.8 trillion in April and _ 3.4 trillion in May. With the narrowing of the the LAF corridor from +/- 50 bps to +/- 25 bps in April 2017, these operations ensured that the weighted average call money rate (WACR) _ the operating target of monetary policy_ broadly traded within the corridor. The spread between the WACR and the policy repo rate narrowed from 29-32 basis points (bps) in March-April to 21 bps in May.Merchandise exports posted double digit growth in March and April 2017 in an environment of slowly improving global trade, with 80 per cent of this expansion contributed by engineering goods, petroleum products, gems and jewellery, readymade garments and chemicals. Merchandise imports also increased sharply, propelled by domestic demand, with the jump of 47.2 per cent in US dollar terms not recorded since 2011. Imports of petroleum and products rose strongly on price effects as international crude prices firmed up in the wake of OPEC¡¯s productions cut. Gold imports also surged in volume terms, initially driven by seasonal and festival demand but subsequently by stockpiling in anticipation of the roll out of the goods and services tax (GST). Non-oil non-gold imports contributed about half of the total import growth in March and April, reflecting higher recourse to electronic goods, pearls and precious stones, coal, machinery and machine tools from overseas markets. With import growth significantly outpacing export growth, the trade deficit increased sizably. The current account deficit (CAD) for the year 2016-17 is likely to remain within 1 per cent of GDP. Unlike in the immediately preceding quarter, capital flows in April-May 2017 were dominated by foreign portfolio investment (FPI), pushed out by risk-on investor sentiment as global growth prospects improved. Also, clarity emerged on taxation issues in the Union Budget and the expectations of faster structural reforms were fuelled by the decisive outcome of State elections. The level of foreign exchange reserves as on June 2, 2017 was US$ 381.2 billion."
wildfires,"Fires continue to blanket Sumatra with haze. This image, taken on March 7, 2014, by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Aqua satellite, shows fires outlined in red. The fires burn in peat forests, which produce dense smoke when they burn. Fire detections from the MODIS sensors on both the Aqua and Terra satellites play a significant role in monitoring burning in Indonesia. This image shows around 400 fire detections, meaning that MODIS detected at least one fire in about 400 one-kilometer pixels.
According to local news reports, some of the more intense fires are burning in the Giam Siak Kecil-Bukit Batu biosphere reserve and were deliberately set to clear land for palm oil plantations. The Giam Siak Kecil-Bukit Batu biosphere reserve contains just over 700,000 hectares of peat forest that sustains a wide range of plant and animal species including the Sumatra tiger, elephant, tapir, and sun bear.
It is illegal to set fires to clear land in Indonesia, but the practice is common. The chief of the Indonesian National Disaster Mitigation Agency told ANTARA News that 99 percent of the fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan were deliberately set. Most fires occur during the dry season between April and October. The fires in 2014 started in February and have already forced Indonesia to declare a state of emergency because of poor air quality."

Six Chinese fishermen died and nine remained missing after two boats capsized in stormy waters near Jeju Island, off the southern tip of the South Korean mainland, the maritime police said. The search for those still unaccounted for continued Wednesday.
The South Korean Central Disaster Relief Headquarters said that another 10 people had been killed in other accidents caused by the storm and that two people had been injured.
Forecasters predicted Bolaven would move north-northeast through North Korea and decrease in strength over land Wednesday."
other,"LONDON (AP) ¡ª The Bank of England indicated Thursday that interest rates may be on the up soon as it painted a fairly rosy picture about the near-term prospects for the British economy following the lifting of lockdown restrictions in the wake of the rapid rollout of coronavirus vaccines.In a statement accompanying its decision to keep the bank¡¯s main interest rate unchanged at the record low of 0.1%, the rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee said ¡°some modest tightening of monetary policy¡± over the coming period ¡°is likely to be necessary to be consistent with meeting the inflation target sustainably in the medium term.¡±The most recent figures showed the annual rate of inflation in the U.K. at 2.5% following a spike largely in energy prices. The latest forecasts show the bank expects inflation to pick up to 4% in 2021, which would be the highest level since 2011 and double the bank¡¯s target.¡°There are good reasons to believe that above-target inflation will be temporary,¡± Bank Governor Andrew Bailey told a press briefing. ¡°If this outlook appears to be in jeopardy, the MPC will not hesitate to act.¡±"
other,"Jon Rahm may be one of the bigger hitters on the PGA Tour, but having a short memory is a trait the Spaniard values even more.
""Happiest animal in the world is a goldfish. You know why? He's got a 10-second memory,"" Rahm said, quoting a line from the popular ""Ted Lasso"" series.
""I played great golf last week, just a couple of bad swings down the stretch, and that's the most important thing to remember.""
The world No. 1 was speaking after his opening round at the BMW Championship on Thursday, where he finished tied atop the leaderboard with Rory McIlroy and American Sam Burns.
The two European Ryder Cup teammates and Burns carded eight-under 64s at Caves Valley Golf Club in Baltimore, Maryland, for the share of the lead in the second event of the FedExCup Playoffs which will determine the PGA Tour's season champion on September 5.
An eagle on the par-five 16th hole for McIlroy shot him up the rankings and into a share of the lead. The Northern Irishman is 28th in the FedExCup rankings, with only the top 30 making it to the season finale -- the Tour Championship -- next week.
""I've went through playoff stretches before where you're always in that lead group. You're either 1, 2 or 3 in the FedExCup, and that can sort of take its mental toll,"" he said. ""I'm in a position where I need to play well just to play next week. There is an element of freewheeling.""
Both Rahm and Burns carded bogey-free rounds on Thursday, and with both set for East Lake next week for the Tour Championship, maintaining their good form is paramount."
drought,"Hundreds of Indian villages have been evacuated as a historic drought forces families to abandon their homes in search of water.
The country has seen extremely high temperatures in recent weeks. On Monday the capital, Delhi, saw its highest ever June temperature of 48C. In Rajasthan, the city of Churu recently experienced highs of 50.8C, making it the hottest place on the planet.
Further south, less than 250 miles from the country’s commercial capital, Mumbai, village after village lies deserted. Estimates suggest up to 90% of the area’s population has fled, leaving the sick and elderly to fend for themselves in the face of a water crisis that shows no sign of abating.
The village of Hatkarwadi, about 20 miles from Beed in Maharashtra state, is almost completely deserted.
Wells and handpumps have run dry in the 45C heatwave. The drought, which officials say is worse than the 1972 famine that affected 25 million people across the state, began early in December. By the end of May, Hatkarwadi had been deserted with only 10-15 families remaining out of a population of more than 2,000.
With 80% of districts in neighbouring Karnataka and 72% in Maharashtra hit by drought and crop failure, the 8 million farmers in these two states are struggling to survive. More than 6,000 tankers supply water to villages and hamlets in Maharashtra daily, as conflict brews between the two states over common water resources.
The acute water shortage has devastated villagers’ agriculture-based livelihood. Crops have withered and died, leaving livestock starving and with little to drink. Major crops, including maize, soya, cotton, sweet lime, pulses and groundnuts _ drivers of the local economy _ have suffered."
valcano eruption,"What made Guatemala’s Fuego Volcano eruption so deadly? On Sunday, Guatemala’s Volcán de Fuego — “Volcano of Fire” — erupted violently, spewing ash nearly four miles into the air and burying villages under an avalanche-like phenomenon called a pyroclastic flow. The disaster’s fatalities had risen to 62 by Monday afternoon, with hundreds more injured. The death toll is expected to climb, and the country’s disaster agency said 3,265 people had been evacuated. In the aftermath, some residents criticized local authorities, asking why there was no advance warning and why officials waited so long to tell them to leave. The 12,000-foot “Volcano of Fire” has been erupting on and off since 2002, and Guatemala has a national institute — INSIVUMEH — committed to actively monitoring the country’s volcanoes. The PBS NewsHour spoke with a panel of volcanologists about why this eruption was so devastating. They said despite the destruction so far, the worst may be yet to come."
other,"Since the MPC¡¯s last meeting in December 2017, global economic activity has gained further pace with growth impulses becoming more synchronised across regions. Among advanced economies (AEs), the Euro area expanded at a robust pace, supported by consumption and investment. Economic optimism alongside falling unemployment and low interest rates are supporting the recovery. The US economy lost some momentum with growth slowing down in Q4 of 2017 even as manufacturing activity touched a multi-month high in December. The Japanese economy continued to grow as manufacturing activity gathered pace in January on strong external demand, providing fillip to the already bullish business confidence.Economic activity accelerated in emerging market economies (EMEs) in the final quarter of 2017. The Chinese economy grew above the official target, driven by strong domestic consumption and robust exports. However, some downside risks to growth remain, especially from easing fixed asset investment and surging debt levels. In Russia, strong private consumption, rising oil prices and high exports are supporting economic activity, although weak investment and economic sanctions are weighing on its growth prospects. In Brazil, data on household spending and unemployment were positive in Q4. However, recovery remains vulnerable to political uncertainty, which has dampened consumer confidence. South Africa continues to face challenges on both domestic and external fronts, including high unemployment and declining factory activity."

JAKARTA, Indonesia — Landslides and flash floods from torrential rains in eastern Indonesia killed at least 41 people and displaced thousands, the country's disaster relief agency said Sunday. More than two dozen others were still missing.

Rescuers recovered 35 bodies and at least five injured, said Lenny Ola, who heads the local disaster agency."
other,"The usual goals of monetary policy are to achieve or maintain full employment, to achieve or maintain a high rate of economic growth, and to stabilize prices and wages. Until the early 20th century, monetary policy was thought by most experts to be of little use in influencing the economy. Inflationary trends after World War II, however, caused governments to adopt measures that reduced inflation by restricting growth in the money supply."
other,"Turning to monetary policy, the FOMC is committed to promoting maximum employment and price stability, as mandated by the Congress. Against the backdrop of headwinds weighing on the economy over the past year, including financial market stresses that emanated from developments abroad, the Committee maintained an unchanged target range for the federal funds rate for most of the year in order to support improvement in the labor market and an increase in inflation toward 2 percent. At its December meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point, to 1/2 to 3/4 percent. In doing so, the Committee recognized the considerable progress the economy had made toward the FOMC's dual objectives. The Committee judged that even after this increase in the federal funds rate target, monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.At its meeting that concluded early this month, the Committee left the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged but reiterated that it expects the evolution of the economy to warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate to achieve and maintain its employment and inflation objectives. As I noted on previous occasions, waiting too long to remove accommodation would be unwise, potentially requiring the FOMC to eventually raise rates rapidly, which could risk disrupting financial markets and pushing the economy into recession. Incoming data suggest that labor market conditions continue to strengthen and inflation is moving up to 2 percent, consistent with the Committee's expectations. At our upcoming meetings, the Committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with these expectations, in which case a further adjustment of the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate.The Committee's view that gradual increases in the federal funds rate will likely be appropriate reflects the expectation that the neutral federal funds rate--that is, the interest rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary and that keeps the economy operating on an even keel--will rise somewhat over time. Current estimates of the neutral rate are well below pre-crisis levels--a phenomenon that may reflect slow productivity growth, subdued economic growth abroad, strong demand for safe longer-term assets, and other factors. The Committee anticipates that the depressing effect of these factors will diminish somewhat over time, raising the neutral funds rate, albeit to levels that are still low by historical standards.That said, the economic outlook is uncertain, and monetary policy is not on a preset course. FOMC participants will adjust their assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate in response to changes to the economic outlook and associated risks as informed by incoming data. Also, changes in fiscal policy or other economic policies could potentially affect the economic outlook. Of course, it is too early to know what policy changes will be put in place or how their economic effects will unfold. While it is not my intention to opine on specific tax or spending proposals, I would point to the importance of improving the pace of longer-run economic growth and raising American living standards with policies aimed at improving productivity. I would also hope that fiscal policy changes will be consistent with putting U.S. fiscal accounts on a sustainable trajectory. In any event, it is important to remember that fiscal policy is only one of the many factors that can influence the economic outlook and the appropriate course of monetary policy. Overall, the FOMC's monetary policy decisions will be directed to the attainment of its congressionally mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability.Finally, the Committee has continued its policy of reinvesting proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from agency debt and mortgage-backed securities. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, has helped maintain accommodative financial conditions."
wildfires,"Swedish firefighters on Tuesday found the body of a man burned to death in a huge forest blaze that started five days ago, engulfing homes and tearing a path of destruction through a vast area of woodland in central Sweden.
More than 1,000 people had to be evacuated on Monday night from villages in the province of Vastmanland, about 140 kilometers (87 miles) northwest of the capital Stockholm. Thousands more locals have since been put on alert and told to prepare to leave their homes.
A truck driver was also hospitalized with severe burns after his vehicle was surrounded by flames.
""It was thick with smoke and I heard the forest was blazing. They were water bombing just above where we live,"" Tommy Persson, one of the evacuees, told Swedish news agency TT.
Emergency services estimate it could take some weeks to bring the fire under control.
Firefighters are currently being aided by 13 helicopters doing water drops over the affected area, but thick smoke and difficult terrain have hampered their efforts. Italy and France have sent firefighting aircraft to help fight the blaze.
It's unclear what sparked the fire - one of the largest seen in Sweden in recent decades. Hot, dry weather conditions are making it tricky for firefighters to bring the flames under control."
other,"About 200 Afghan interpreters and their families have arrived in the US - the first of a group of 2,500 Afghans being evacuated as the Taliban advances.
The interpreters are being resettled under a visa programme for those who worked with the US during the recently ended 20-year war with the Taliban.
They arrived in the early hours of Friday morning and were taken to Fort Lee military base in Virginia.
They are expected to stay there for around a week while they are processed.
In a statement, US President Joe Biden called the arrivals ""a milestone"" and ""the first of many"" as US authorities work to relocate eligible Afghans out of harm's way.
Afghans eligible for Special Immigrant Visas (SIV) will be transported either to the US, American facilities abroad or to third countries while they finish their applications. The most recent arrivals have already completed an extensive vetting process.
On Thursday, the US Senate approved more than $1bn (£719m) to pay for the evacuations, including housing and transportation.
The bill would also loosen applicant requirements and allow for 8,000 more visas in addition to the ones already allocated for.
The Taliban have been advancing Afghanistan following a decision by Mr Biden to withdraw the remaining American troops from the country.
With those advances have come danger to those who worked alongside US troops during the two-decade conflict.
Since 2008, approximately 70,000 Afghans have been resettled in the US on an SIV .
Last week, a senior state department official said that the total number of visa applicants now stands just over 20,000. About half have yet to complete the first steps of the process."
drought,"A two-decade-long dry spell that has parched much of the western United States is turning into one of the deepest megadroughts in the region in more than 1,200 years, a new study found.
And about half of this historic drought can be blamed on man-made global warming, according to a study in Thursday’s journal Science.
Scientists looked at a nine-state area from Oregon and Wyoming down through California and New Mexico, plus a sliver of southwestern Montana and parts of northern Mexico. They used thousands of tree rings to compare a drought that started in 2000 and is still going — despite a wet 2019 — to four past megadroughts since the year 800.
With soil moisture as the key measurement, they found only one other drought that was as big and was likely slightly bigger. That one started in 1575, just 10 years after St. Augustine, the first European city in the United States, was founded, and that drought ended before the Pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock in 1620.
What’s happening now is “a drought bigger than what modern society has seen,” said study lead author A. Park Williams, a bioclimatologist at Columbia University.
Daniel Swain, a UCLA climate scientist who wasn’t part of the study, called the research important because it provides evidence “that human-caused climate change transformed what might have otherwise been a moderate long-term drought into a severe event comparable to the ‘megadroughts’ of centuries past.”"
other,"Currently available information suggests that the recovery of the global economy has strengthened, supported by the economic stimulus in major countries and the expansion of vaccinations. In global financial markets, stock prices and government bond yields in major countries have increased, driven mainly by higher expectations for economic recovery. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the severity of the resurgence of COVID-19 and the status of vaccine distribution, as well as by national policy responses and their effects.The recovery of the Korean economy has strengthened somewhat. Exports have sustained their buoyancy and facilities investment has continued to recover robustly, while the sluggishness in private consumption has eased. Labor market conditions have showed some signs of improvement, with the number of persons employed shifting to an increase compared to the corresponding period last year. Going forward, the economy is likely to continue its recovery, led by exports and investment. However, uncertainties surrounding the pace of recovery are judged to remain elevated. GDP growth this year is projected to be above the February forecast of 3.0%.Consumer price inflation has risen to the mid-1% level due to an increase in petroleum product prices as well as rising prices of agricultural, livestock, and fisheries products. Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) has moved up slightly within the mid-0% range. The inflation expectations of the general public have picked up to the lower-2% level. Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will run above the path projected in February and fluctuate for some time at around 2%, before declining slightly. Core inflation is forecast to increase gradually to the 1% range.In domestic financial markets, long-term market interest rates and stock prices have risen, affected by global financial market movements and improvement of economic indicators. The Korean won to US dollar exchange rate rose slightly, largely reflecting the strengthening of the US dollar. Household loan growth has remained high, and housing prices have continued to increase rapidly in all parts of the country.The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to support the economy and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. While the Korean economic recovery is expected to strengthen gradually, there is still a high level of uncertainty surrounding the path of COVID-19 and inflationary pressures on the demand side are forecast to be modest. Thus, the Board will maintain its accommodative stance of monetary policy. In this process the Board will thoroughly assess developments related to COVID-19 as well as the effects of the policy measures taken in response to the pandemic, while paying attention to changes in financial stability conditions such as fund flows to asset markets and household debt growth."
earthquake,"A magnitude-6.4 earthquake struck Argentina’s west-central province of San Juan around midnight on Monday, January 18, 2021. The epicenter has been preliminarily located at 28 miles (45 kilometers) southwest of San Juan city, the provincial capital town (population ~ 500 thousand). The event left no fatalitities, despite it’s “very strong” maximum intensity, as reported in San Juan city by the national seismological survey (INPRES). Five people were injured and 30-40 others were evacuated from damaged buildings.
Field surveys to evaluate damage are still in progress. Despite its shallow depth — 4-5 miles (6-8 kilometers) — this event was widely felt in central-western Argentina; light shaking was felt in cities such as San Luis (200 miles/322 kilometers) and Córdoba (275 miles/443 kilometers). Numerous aftershocks of magnitude-4.9 and smaller have so far nucleated in the epicentral area at depths ranging from 4 to 7 miles (7 to 12 kilometers).

Only ground failures due to shaking in the foundations of a paved road (Route 40) have so far been observed. The epicenter is located in an uninhabited, rugged intermountain depression and surface deformation has not been reported after field checks."
other,"First, crude oil prices (Indian basket) firmed up from US$ 56 a barrel in October 2017 to US$ 67 a barrel in January 2018 (Chart I.1). Thereafter, they have fluctuated between US$ 60 and US$ 67. With the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) extending production cuts through the end of 2018 and the drawdown of inventories to meet increasing demand, being buffeted somewhat by the response of US shale oil production, the baseline scenario assumes crude oil prices (Indian basket) to average around US$ 68 a barrel in 2018-19.Second, the exchange rate (Indian rupee vis-¨¤-vis the US dollar) has exhibited two-way movements since October 2017. It appreciated till the early part of January 2018 on buoyant capital inflows and weakening of the US dollar. Subsequently, it depreciated from early February, following the release of stronger than expected US non-farm payrolls and wages data that fuelled expectations of a faster pace of interest rate increases by the US Federal Reserve and over concerns of the impact of higher crude oil prices on India¡¯s trade deficit. By March, the exchange rate of the rupee was close to its October 2017 level.Third, the pace of global economic activity in 2017 turned out to be stronger than expected due to robust growth in the advanced economies (AEs) and significantly stronger growth in EMEs. Global growth is expected to accelerate further in 2018, benefitting from the boost to investment demand in the US from corporate tax cuts, robust recovery in the euro area and generally improved growth outlook in EMEs (Chart I.2). The sharp recovery in world trade is expected to sustain in 2018 and enlarge the prospects of another year of strong and resilient global activity."

drought,"The answer to ""How dry is it?"" is no joke: It's ""severe drought"" dry.
The National Weather Service declared Thursday that all of Indian River and St. Lucie counties, plus inland Martin County, are experiencing severe drought conditions. Coastal Martin County has moderate drought conditions.
Also on Thursday, the South Florida Water Management District issued a water shortage warning, telling the 8.1 million residents in its jurisdiction, which includes Martin and St. Lucie counties: Save water on your own now, or you may be forced to cut back in the future.
The St. Johns River Water Management District issued a similar water shortage warning in March for several of its counties, but not Indian River County.
The last time the entire Treasure Coast had a severe drought was 2011. That's also the last time the South Florida district issued mandatory watering restrictions, including twice-a-week landscape watering limits from Orlando to the Keys. South Florida golf courses and agriculture were required to reduce water use by 15 percent."
drought,"Shantabai Babulkar's day begins before dawn with a 5-kilometre trek across barren fields and dusty scrubland to fetch water from a distant well.
She balances two metal pots of muddy water atop her head, and carries a third in the crook of her arm - the only water she and her family of five will have for the day's needs of drinking, cooking and washing.
Babulkar's village of Shahapur, in Thane district of the west Indian state of Maharashtra, is in the grips of one of the worst droughts in decades. Parched fields, burnt crops and wasted cattle have helped drive up the number of suicides by distressed farmers unable to repay their loans. Tens of thousands have left their farms in search of menial jobs, with many joining the ranks of the unemployed poor in the cities.
The vast Indian hinterland has long faced water shortages, especially in the torrid months from April to June, before the annual monsoon rains bring some relief. The showers, which normally run from June to September, are crucial in a country where 60 per cent of the 1.25 billion population works in agriculture and less than half the farmland is irrigated. But decades of groundwater abuse, flawed water policies and poor monsoons have turned large parts of central India into an arid dust bowl.
Hundreds of millions of people in at least 13 states are reeling from severe drought, a situation that is expected to worsen in the coming months. Last month, a power plant was shut down for 10 days in West Bengal after running out of water to cool the coal-fired plant's heating pipes. Sizzling temperatures touching nearly 43 degree Celsius this week have led to more than 130 heat-related deaths in Orissa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana states.
But nowhere is the situation as extreme as in Maharashtra.
On Wednesday, a Mumbai court demanded 13 Indian Premier League cricket matches be moved to locations other than Maharashtra because maintaining the cricket grounds would require millions of gallons of water.
Environmental activist Darryl D'Monte said Maharashtra's water crisis had been exacerbated by a recent agricultural shift from growing crops of millet, sorghum and other cereals to growing water-guzzling sugarcane.
""It's time we took a longer view and stop the wastage of water with sugarcane,"" he said, accusing big sugarcane interests and politicians of ignoring the region's naturally dry climate in pursuit of profits from the lucrative crop."
Typhoon,"Typhoon Fitow barrelled into China's east coast Monday, packing winds of more than 200 kilometres (125 miles) an hour, after hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated and bullet train services were suspended.
At least three people were reported killed, all of them near the city of Wenzhou in Zhejiang province, the state broadcaster CCTV said.
Parts of Zhejiang, which borders the commercial hub Shanghai, saw nearly 29 centimetres (11 inches) of rain over 17 hours from Sunday to early Monday, while areas in Fujian to the south saw up to 16 centimetres, the official China News Service said.
In the hard-hit county of Cangnan in Wenzhou, more than 1,200 homes collapsed and damages amounted to hundreds of millions of yuan, China National Radio said.
One of the victims, 55-year-old Ni Wenlin, died ""after strong wind blew him off a hill"" late Sunday, Xinhua news agency said, citing municipal flood control authorities.
Another person died of electric shock, CCTV reported.
In Fujian the typhoon snapped electricity poles in half, leaving power lines on the ground, and bent iron road signs out of shape, the radio reported.
In the coastal city of Ningde, a village leader told the Beijing Times that huge waves had damaged a 200-hectare (490-acre) seaweed farm, on which nearly 100 families depended for their livelihood.
At least 59 bullet trains in Zhejiang were cancelled, along with 22 flights from the provincial capital Hangzhou and 27 in Wenzhou, Xinhua said.
Sections of highways were shut and more than 350 buses from Wenzhou were cancelled.
Forecasters said the storm was expected to move northwest but weaken quickly.
But continued rainstomes were expected due to another typhoon, Danas, which was set to hit Japan's main islands on Monday.
Packing winds of up to 180 kilometres per hour near its centre, Danas was battering the southern Japanese chain of Okinawa, where more than 50 flights at Naha airport were cancelled while schools were shut, according to local media.
The Japanese meteorological agency issued an alert for strong winds and high waves, while urging residents to remain on guard for floods and landslides as well as lightning and tornadoes.
Local authorities in Okinawa and Kagoshima separately issued evacuation advisories to some 6,500 households, public broadcaster NHK said."
other,"The economic recovery gained greater traction in the second half of last year. Real gross domestic product (GDP) is currently estimated to have risen at an average annual rate of more than 3-1/2 percent in the third and fourth quarters, up from a 1-3/4 percent pace in the first half. The pickup in economic activity has fueled further progress in the labor market. About 1-1/4 million jobs have been added to payrolls since the previous Monetary Policy Report last July, and 3-1/4 million have been added since August 2012, the month before the Federal Reserve began a new round of asset purchases to add momentum to the recovery. The unemployment rate has fallen nearly a percentage point since the middle of last year and 1-1/2 percentage points since the beginning of the current asset purchase program. Nevertheless, the recovery in the labor market is far from complete. The unemployment rate is still well above levels that Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants estimate is consistent with maximum sustainable employment. Those out of a job for more than six months continue to make up an unusually large fraction of the unemployed, and the number of people who are working part time but would prefer a full-time job remains very high. These observations underscore the importance of considering more than the unemployment rate when evaluating the condition of the U.S. labor market.Among the major components of GDP, household and business spending growth stepped up during the second half of last year. Early in 2013, growth in consumer spending was restrained by changes in fiscal policy. As this restraint abated during the second half of the year, household spending accelerated, supported by job gains and by rising home values and equity prices. Similarly, growth in business investment started off slowly last year but then picked up during the second half, reflecting improving sales prospects, greater confidence, and still-favorable financing conditions. In contrast, the recovery in the housing sector slowed in the wake of last year's increase in mortgage rates.Inflation remained low as the economy picked up strength, with both the headline and core personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, price indexes rising only about 1 percent last year, well below the FOMC's 2 percent objective for inflation over the longer run. Some of the recent softness reflects factors that seem likely to prove transitory, including falling prices for crude oil and declines in non-oil import prices."
wildfires,"By Monday evening, the count showed 156 structures and almost 2,600 acres were subjected to the blowtorch of Texas Panhandle wind and wildfire Sunday and Monday just west and north of Fritch.
Earlier in the day, a Texas Department of Public Safety helicopter flew over the area for a survey of the charred landscape where some homes stood and others were ashes, and where there were reports of multiple exploding propane tanks, authorities said.
Revised estimates put the fire at only 65 percent contained, according to the Texas A&M Forest Service website. Forest Service Regional Coordinator Troy Ducheneaux said firefighters continued to deal with the fire his agency is calling the Double Diamond wildfire, going house-to-house in areas hit by the blaze to search for possible victims.
“We’ve got several areas we are addressing. We have broken the fire area into basically three different zones,” he said. “The (National) Park Service area is taking care of their area of responsibility, and we have broken up the Fritch area into two different divisions. We’ve got two different crews working in those areas; they are addressing those hot spots.
“The plan for later today and into (Tuesday) is to continue to improve contingency lines with dozers we have in place that are working the areas to ensure that we get this thing totally wrapped up.”
Earlier Monday, Fritch Police Chief Monte Leggett told some residents they probably won’t be able to return to their homes until Tuesday morning at the earliest.
“We’ve got crews still in the area. They are mopping it up at this point. We’ve got a lot of hot spots. You know how yuccas and mesquite are. They don’t want to go out,” Leggett said. “Lake Meredith Harbor is still in full evacuation. No one in, no one out. The majority of the destruction was in the Lake Meredith Harbor subdivision.”
About 2,100 people were evacuated from areas threatened by the fire overnight, Ducheneaux said.
They were housed in several shelters.
“It’s really bad,” said Danny Richards, Hutchinson County emergency management coordinator. “It looks like a war zone. It’s a disaster.”
The homes destroyed by the fire in Lake Meredith Harbor were a mix of mobile and traditional homes, Richards said."
Typhoon,"Delta has been downgraded from a once powerful hurricane to a tropical storm as it moves inland across the U.S. South.
The National Hurricane Center in Miami said Delta came ashore Friday evening in southwest Louisiana as a Category 2 hurricane but quickly weakened and has become a tropical storm as it moves inland. By Saturday morning, it had maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 kph).
Forecasters say the storm is moving to the north-northeast on a track across central and north Louisiana that is expected to continue through Saturday morning.

Typhoon,"Hurricane Irma is the strongest Atlantic basin hurricane ever recorded outside the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. It lasted as a hurricane from August 31 until September 11. The storm, which stretched 650 miles from east to west, affected at least nine US states, turning streets into rivers, ripping down power lines, uprooting trees and cutting off coastal communities.
On September 6, Hurricane Irma left a string of small Caribbean islands devastated. The eye of the hurricane passed over Barbuda, damaging about 95% of the buildings on the island.
The hurricane hit southwest Florida on September 10, battering the state's lower half and leaving a trail of tornadoes and storm-surge flooding as its core slowly moved inland.
The massive storm triggered evacuation orders for 5.6 million people before it made two landfalls.

other,"In April 2009, MAS re-centred the exchange rate policy band downwards to the prevailing level of the S$NEER, while maintaining the zero percent appreciation path which was adopted in October 2008.  This decision was made against the backdrop of dissipating inflationary pressures and weak growth prospects for the Singapore economy in the midst of the global financial crisis. Since the last policy review, the S$NEER (Chart 1) has fluctuated in the upper half of the policy band.  This reflected the broad-based weakness in the US$ since the end of the first quarter, as well as strong capital inflows to the region.  The domestic three-month interbank rate has remained at 0.69% over the past six months, amidst low global interest rates."
other,"Since the sixth bi-monthly statement of February 2016, global economic activity has been quiescent. Perceptions of downside risks to recovery in some advanced economies (AEs) at the beginning of 2016 have eased, while major emerging market economies (EMEs) continue to contend with weak growth and still elevated inflation amidst tighter financial conditions. World trade remains subdued due to falling import demand from EMEs and stress in mining and extractive industries. In the US, consumer spending was underpinned by a strengthening labour market, but flagging exports proved to be a drag on growth in Q4 and cloud the near-term outlook. In the Euro area, tailwinds in the form of aggressive monetary policy accommodation and still low energy prices have supported activity in an environment beset with uncertainties from the migrant crisis, intensifying stress in the banking sector, and possible Brexit. While Japan escaped recession in Q4 of 2015, a combination of weak consumer spending, business investment and exports has slowed the economy in Q1 of 2016. In China, sluggish industrial production, contracting exports, capital outflows and substantial excess capacity in factories and the property market remain formidable headwinds, notwithstanding significant monetary and fiscal policy stimulus. EME commodity exporters have benefited recently from the firming up of commodity prices and risk-on investor sentiment has appreciated their currencies. Across EMEs, however, weak domestic fundamentals, lacklustre external demand and country-specific constraints continue to restrain growth. Global financial markets have recouped the losses suffered in the turbulence at the beginning of the year. From mid-February, a firming up of crude prices buoyed market sentiment, allaying fears of global recessionary risks. With China reducing reserve requirements, the ECB expanding accommodation and the Fed providing dovish guidance while staying on hold, equity markets rallied. In bond markets across AEs and EMEs, yields gradually eased, with country-specific variations. The US dollar has retreated from January peak and has eased further in the aftermath of the FOMC¡¯s March meeting. On the other hand, the euro and the yen have appreciated, reacting perversely to exceptional accommodation. Currencies across EMEs have also appreciated as portfolio flows returned cautiously to local debt and equity markets. Gold prices have jumped 16 per cent in Q1 of 2016 on safe haven demand. Commodity prices, including oil,  have picked up recently, though they still remain soft. However, the uneasy calm that prevails in financial markets could be dispelled easily by a sudden return of risk-off investor sentiment on incoming data, especially pertaining to China or to US inflation."
other,"The Texas Supreme Court has ruled that the state House may compel the attendance of its members by civil arrest, overturning a lower court order from earlier this month.
The Texas House has yet to reach a quorum during the second called special session because the majority of House Democrats have been absent from the floor since July 12, when they initially fled the state to break quorum during the first special session as a way to block restrictive voting legislation.
The state House speaker last week signed 52 civil arrest warrants for Democrats who are absent without excuse. The sergeant-at-arms last week sent the warrants to those Democrats, deputized law enforcement to find them and even dropped paperwork off at some members' homes, though no arrests have been made.
""The question now before this Court is not whether it is a good idea for the Texas House of Representatives to arrest absent members to compel a quorum. Nor is the question whether the proposed voting legislation giving rise to this dispute is desirable,"" wrote Justice Jimmy Blacklock in Tuesday's opinion. ""Those are political questions far outside the scope of the judicial function. The legal question before this Court concerns only whether the Texas Constitution gives the House of Representatives the authority to physically compel the attendance of absent members. We conclude that it does, and we therefore direct the district court to withdraw"" the temporary restraining order.
The ruling stems from a petition that 19 Texas House Democrats filed in Travis County, where a state district judge issued a temporary restraining order. The all-Republican Texas Supreme Court quickly issued a temporary stay on the Democratic judge's order, pending further review."
Typhoon,"Typhoon Haikui slammed into the east coast of China on Wednesday morning, pummeling the area around the business metropolis of Shanghai with heavy wind and rain.
The storm's winds were at ""severe typhoon"" strength when it made landfall in the province of Zhejiang, about 225 kilometers (140 miles) south of Shanghai, the China Meteorological Administration said. The winds diminished to typhoon strength as Haikui moved inland.
A severe typhoon is considered to have maximum sustained wind speed of between 150 and 184 kilometers per hour (93 and 114 mph). A typhoon has maximum sustained winds of between 118 and 149 kilometers per hour (73 and 93 mph)."
flood,"More than 100 dead as Vietnam reels from 'worst floods in decades' More than 100 people are dead and thousands of homes have been submerged in some of Vietnam's most severe floods in decades, with authorities warning that more bad weather is to come.  The death toll from weeks of flooding and landslides in central Vietnam has risen to 111, with 22 people still missing, Reuters reported Wednesday. ""These devastating floods are some of the worst we have seen in decades,"" Nguyen Thi Xuan Thu, the president of Vietnam's Red Cross Society, said in a statement Tuesday. More than 7,200 hectares of food crops have been submerged and damaged, and more than 691,000 cattle and poultry have been killed or swept away in flood water, according to the state-run Vietnam News Agency (VNA). Sixteen national highways and 161,880 meters of local roads in four provinces have also been damaged."
drought,"Drought conditions worsened in several states over the past week from extreme heat and weeks with little rain, raising the prospect that grocery staples such as bread and beans could cost more as the region that produces those commodities is hardest hit.
Drought conditions have begun to stress corn, soybeans, wheat and livestock in some areas, according to the weekly U.S. Drought Monitor released Thursday by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
In an image on the U.S. Drought Monitor website, sections of the U.S. are pictured as red and dark red -- indicating extreme or exceptional drought. The website indicates that the Drought Monitor focuses on broad-scale conditions and that local conditions may vary.
Nearly 11 percent of the continental United States is in moderate drought or worse, said Richard Heim, a meteorologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in this week's drought summary. The report is compiled weekly using data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and NOAA.
""Much of Montana and parts of the Dakotas, Nebraska, and Kansas had no rain this week; some areas have been drier than normal for the last two to three months; and some drought indicators reflect dryness for the last 12 months,"" Heim wrote.
About half of the nation's spring wheat, 13 percent of winter wheat, 15 percent of corn and 14 percent of the soybeans are in drought, the report said.
Consumers could see the price of bread at the grocery counter rise, said Doug Goehring, agriculture commissioner for North Dakota, the nation's largest producer of spring wheat and second largest grower of winter wheat."
drought,"Once the wettest place on Earth, Cherrapunji, a town in northeastern India, has faced a drought each winter for the past few years. Kerala, a state in the southwest, flooded devastatingly in 2018, but saw its wells run dry soon after.
Chennai, a growing south-Indian metropolis, was inundated by rains in 2015—but this summer, waiting for the monsoon, its 11 million residents have watched three of its four reservoirs run dry. Meanwhile, across India, the groundwater that provides an invaluable buffer between monsoons is severely depleted and in danger of being irreversibly lost.
Welcome to the new India: hot and desiccated and wet and flooded, all at once, with the fates of 1.3 billion people and rich biodiversity hotspots riding upon increasingly unpredictable rains.
The southwest monsoon, which usually drenches India from June to September, has come ten days late this year, bringing 30 percent less rain than normal for the month of June. In the north, Delhi has thus far seen almost no rain, while in southern India reservoir levels in southern India are running dangerously low. Headlines in newspapers scream “zero-day” and “running dry” and “historic drought.”
Chennai, a megacity now dependent on tanker trucks, leads the grim news. But Bangalore, India’s answer to Silicon Valley, is not far behind. There are murmurs that this burgeoning, bulging city will have used all its groundwater by 2020.
The dire predicaments of these two urban areas is a cautionary tale—a symptom of the larger malaise that plagues water management in a country that is soon to be the most populous on Earth."
Typhoon,"A powerful typhoon pounded South Korea with strong winds and heavy rain Tuesday, killing nine and churning up rough seas that smashed two Chinese fishing ships into rocks and forced the coast guard to perform a daring rescue of survivors.
Rescuers saved 12 fishermen and searched for 10 still missing from the ships that hit rocks off South Korea's southern Jeju island. Five fishermen were killed, officials said.
Separately, at least four other people died as Typhoon Bolaven knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of South Koreans, cancelled flights and temporarily halted joint war games by U.S. and South Korean military forces.
North Korea, which is still struggling to rebuild from massive floods and a devastating drought before that, was next in the typhoon's path. Heavy rain and strong winds hit many parts of the country Tuesday, a day that was supposed to be a North Korean celebration of its young people.
The typhoon knocked down hundreds of trees, destroyed power cables and caused blackouts in the western cities of Kaesong and Haeju, the North's official Korean Central News Agency said. It said damage was expected to grow as the typhoon moves across the country.
Off South Korea's Jeju island, dangerous waves kept rescue vessels from approaching the wrecked fishing ships. The coast guard used a special gun to shoot rope to one ship so officers could pull themselves over and bring the fishermen back to shore, coast guard spokesman Ko Chang-keon said.
Eighteen fishermen survived. The coast guard rescued 12, and the others swam or were washed ashore."
other,"Estimates of the impact of the July 2018 MSP announcements on CPI inflation that are available in the public domain range from 20 bps to 110 bps. For operational purposes, however, precision in these estimates is the key since it conditions the monetary policy response to the likely deviations of inflation from its target. Illustratively, a straight-line approach of imputing the full increase in MSPs on to headline CPI inflation by using CPI weights for the crops in consideration, but without factoring in the scale of procurement operations, may overestimate the MSP impact.The total impact of MSPs on inflation comprises a first round (direct) effect and subsequent second (indirect) round effects. The first round effect _ the quantum by which individual commodities respond to MSP shock _ is estimated econometrically. The second-round effects are estimated using a two-stage process: (1) A static approach that mimics time-invariant economy-wide effects, is first employed to estimate the commodity level producer price effect through a series of iterations using input-output (IO) tables for 2012-13 and mapping those effects to the wholesale price index (WPI) using WPI weights; (2) The pass-through of the wholesale price increases to CPI food inflation components is then worked out by using elasticities derived from an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model.The second-round effects are also examined using RBI¡¯s quarterly projection model, which is a new Keynesian open economy gap model. It attempts to capture several inter-twined effects dynamically. A hike in MSP could trigger relative price adjustments between MSP and non-MSP food items. Higher MSPs could also lead to a rise in rural incomes which would boost food demand. Furthermore, higher labour demand could lead to overall wage increases in the rural sector as labourers migrate from sowing/cropping of non-MSP to MSP crops. This increase in prices of food items, coupled with rising rural wages and incomes, could affect prices of non-food goods and services via second round effects (Ghate et al., 2018). The increase in the cotton MSP could directly affect inflation through retail clothing (Chart II.1.3)."

That mandate is explicitly stipulated in Act No. 23 of 1999 concerning Bank Indonesia, as amended by Act No. 3 of 2004 and Act No. 6 of 2009 in Article 7. Rupiah stability encompasses two dimensions. First, rupiah stability is the price stability of goods and services, as reflected by inflation. The second dimension relates to rupiah exchange rate stability against other currencies. Indonesia implements a free-floating exchange rate regime and exchange rate stability is necessary to achieve and maintain price and financial system stabilityIn pursuit of its mandate, Bank Indonesia adopted the Inflation Targeting Framework (ITF) as its monetary policy framework on 1st July 2005. ITF is relevant for the mandate and institutional arrangements mandated in prevailing laws. Based on ITF, inflation is the overriding objective. Nonetheless, Bank Indonesia continues to refine its monetary policy framework based on the changing dynamics and economic challenges faced in order to increase effectiveness."
drought,"Droughts in California are mainly controlled by wind, not by the amount of evaporated moisture in the air, new research has found.
The findings were published in Geophysical Research Letters, a journal of the American Geophysical Union, on June 30. The research increases the understanding of how the water cycle is related to extreme events and could eventually help in predicting droughts and floods, said lead author Jiangfeng Wei, a research scientist at The University of Texas at Austin’s Jackson School of Geosciences.
“Ocean evaporation provides moisture for California precipitation but is not the reason for droughts there, although the ocean evaporation is slightly lower during droughts,” Wei said.
The researchers analyzed 30-year data sets that recorded precipitation, ocean evaporation, surface wind speed and atmospheric pressure on and near the west coast of the United States. These are all factors that influence the water cycle in California. One of the difficulties of studying the water cycle, Wei said, is that the water sources for precipitation cannot be directly observed, so the team also used a mathematical moisture-tracking method and high-resolution model simulations.
Their analysis showed that although moisture evaporated from the Pacific Ocean is the major source for California precipitation, the amount of water evaporated did not strongly influence precipitation in California, except in the cases of very heavy flooding. That’s because the amount of water evaporated from this ocean region does not change much year by year, researchers found, and did not cause rain to occur more or less often.
“Ocean evaporation has little direct influence on California precipitation because of its relatively weak variability,” Wei said.
Instead, the researchers found that disturbances in atmospheric circulation, the large-scale movement of air, have the most effect on drought because they can affect factors that will cause it to rain more or less.
The study co-authors are Qinjian Jin, a postdoctoral researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who earned his Ph.D. at the Jackson School; Zong-Liang Yang, a professor in the Jackson School’s Department of Geological Sciences; and Paul Dirmeyer, a professor at George Mason University.
Most of California has been in a severe drought since 2011, although a strong El Niño in the winter of 2015 helped diminish the drought. The current drought is caused by a high-pressure system that disturbs the atmospheric circulation. The development of the high-pressure system is related to a sea surface temperature pattern in the Pacific Ocean, according to research cited by the study.
“Although this is a very rare event, the probability of this kind of high-pressure system is likely increasing with global warming,” the authors said.
Yang said that the research could aid in the prediction of droughts and floods by improving scientific understanding of the intricate factors that influence rainfall the most.
“The topic is extremely timely as current and future climate change would mean more changes in extreme events such as droughts and floods,” Yang said. “Understanding this asymmetric contribution of ocean evaporation to drought and flooding in California will ultimately help us make better predictions.”"
earthquake,"Quake hits remote part of Papua New Guinea; no casualties A strong, deep earthquake has shaken inland Papua New Guinea and officials say there are no immediate reports of casualties or major damage CANBERRA, Australia -- A strong, deep earthquake shook inland Papua New Guinea on Friday, and officials said there were no immediate reports of casualties or major damage. Shaking was felt in the capital Port Moresby but not strongly. The U.S. Geological Survey said the 7.0 magnitude quake was 80 kilometers (53 miles) deep. Shallower quakes tend to cause more surface damage. The epicenter was close to Morobe Patrol Post, with a population of 15,000 in Morobe province. Locals reported on social media the wharf at Morobe Patrol Post had “cracked in half."" Some damage was reported on social media in coastal villages. Residents were advised to go inland if there were any sign of tidal changes or irregular ocean patterns. Mark Maniaol, a hotel employee in Lae, the capital of Morobe and the country's second-largest city, said he left the quake but it was not severe. He was not aware of any damage in the city. The Morobe Provincial Disaster Office Director Charley Masange said he did not expect to receive damage reports from the epicenter until Saturday. “The epicenter is in the mountains. Not many people live there and it's very remote so it takes a long time to get information,” Manage said. “I'm not expecting major damage.”"
drought,"Australia's most populous state, New South Wales (NSW), is now entirely in drought, officials have confirmed.
A dry winter has intensified what has been called the worst drought in living memory in parts of eastern Australia.
NSW produces about a quarter of Australia's agricultural output. It was officially listed as ""100% in drought"" on Wednesday.
The state and federal governments have provided A$576m (£330m; $430m) in emergency relief funding.

valcano eruption,"How Guatemala has dealt with volcanoes over the centuries June 8, 2018 7.33pm AEST When the Fuego volcano near Antigua, Guatemala erupted on June 3, it wasn’t immediately apparent to the people living on its slopes quite how dangerous this event would be. The explosive nature, speed and direction of the eruption were all unexpected. Entire villages were destroyed, and houses covered in thick ash. The death toll stands at at least 99, hundreds of people are missing, and further volcanic activity is hindering rescue efforts. Guatemalans have come together in solidarity with the victims and are responding generously to calls to donate basic necessities and money. Celebrities, foreign governments and aid organisations are all pledging their help. This is the worst volcanic eruption in Guatemala for more than a century, but it’s not an isolated event _ Fuego is an active volcano that erupts with some regularity. As one official put it, at first this seemed like “one of those normal eruptions that people are used to”. Several teenagers died because they wanted to take in the spectacle of the eruption, not realising that this one was different."

wildfires,"The vicious 2012 wildfire season now unfolding in the interior West is hardly a surprise. Much of the region has been in a drought for more than a decade. This winter’s snowpack was sparse, particularly in Colorado, and it melted and ran off early. Temperatures have been high, and humidity has been low—making fuels from grasses to trees very dry and flammable.
All of that means conditions ripe for fires, which have come with a vengeance. New Mexico has had its biggest fire ever, and Colorado has seen the most destructive fires in its history, with the Waldo Canyon Fire near Colorado Springs and the High Park Fire near Fort Collins destroying more than 600 homes combined. Even as firefighters have brought the big Colorado fires near containment, other large blazes have broken out in Wyoming, Utah, and Montana.
Yes, it’s looking like a big fire year. And yes, this is part of the new normal. It’s pretty much exactly what climate experts have been predicting and what the data have been telegraphing for some time. While there are various proposals on the table to deal with increasingly destructive wildfires, they are likely to continue and become worse unless we tackle climate change."
wildfires,"Hundreds more people have been forced to flee their homes in Greece as firefighters struggle to contain huge, days-old, wildfires.
Tourists and locals were evacuated by boat from Evia, the country's second-largest island, on Sunday.
More than 2,000 people have now been evacuated in total. Houses and power lines have also been destroyed.
While the fire on Evia is the most severe, dozens of smaller blazes are burning around the country.
The fires broke out after the most severe heatwave in 30 years, in which temperatures spiked to 45C (113F).
Heatwaves such as this are becoming more likely and more extreme because of human-induced climate change. The subsequent hot, dry weather is likely to fuel wildfires.
""We have ahead of us another difficult evening, another difficult night,"" Civil Protection Deputy Minister Nikos Hardalias said on Sunday.
""On Evia we have two major fire fronts, one in the north and one in the south,"" he said, adding that the situation around the capital Athens had improved.
""We are afraid of the danger of flare-ups,"" Mr Hardalias warned.
Hundreds of firefighters have been deployed to Evia, and a total of 17 planes and helicopters are being used. The army has also been sent in.
Dramatic footage showed ferries full of people surrounded by the burning landscape and bright red skies.
""I feel angry. I lost my home... nothing will be the same,"" one resident, Vasilikia, told Reuters news agency as she boarded a rescue ferry on Sunday.
""It's a disaster. It's huge. Our villages are destroyed, there is nothing left from our homes,"" she added."

other,"The Singapore economy should continue to expand for the rest of 2013 and into 2014, although some volatility in growth rates is likely.  There are short-term uncertainties in the external environment, and MAS is closely monitoring economic and financial developments.  Barring a significant deterioration in global demand conditions, the labour market will remain tight, and exert further upward pressures on MAS Core Inflation as firms pass on accumulated costs to consumer prices. MAS will therefore maintain its policy of a modest and gradual appreciation of the S$NEER policy band.  There will be no change to the slope of the policy band, and the level at which it is centred.  The present width of the band is sufficient to accommodate temporary fluctuations in the S$NEER, and will be kept unchanged.  This policy stance is assessed to be appropriate, taking into account the balance of risks between external demand uncertainties and rising domestic inflationary pressures."
earthquake,"An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 8.1 hit off New Zealand on Friday morning, triggering a Pacific-wide tsunami alert, the U.S. Geological Survey and local authorities said.

other,"The Reserve Bank's liquidity management framework was last reviewed in 2014. While on the whole the current liquidity management framework has worked well, it has also become somewhat complex. An assessment of liquidity position by different market participants has varied markedly and is not always in sync with the actual systemic liquidity position in the economy.Accordingly, it has been decided to constitute an Internal Working Group to review comprehensively the existing liquidity management framework and suggest measures, among others, to (i) simplify the current liquidity management framework; and (ii) clearly communicate the objectives, quantitative measures and toolkit of liquidity management by the Reserve Bank. The Group is expected to submit its report by mid-July 2019.With a view to creating market infrastructure that would ensure fair and transparent pricing for users of foreign exchange (such as Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) exporters and importers, individuals, etc.), the Reserve Bank in October 2017, had issued a discussion paper proposing to set up a foreign exchange trading platform for retail participants that would provide customers with access to an electronic trading platform through an internet-based application on which they can purchase/sell foreign currency at market clearing prices. By unifying the existing fragmented market microstructure, this platform would provide transparency of pricing and promote competition among market-makers leading to better pricing for all customers, regardless of order size. The trading platform has now been developed by the Clearing Corporation of India (CCIL) and is being tested by users. The platform will be available to users for transactions from early August 2019.A well-functioning money market is a crucial link in the chain of monetary policy transmission, apart from being a basic necessity for pricing and liquidity in other financial markets. The Reserve Bank has issued regulations over time covering different money market products _ call money, repo, commercial paper, certificates of deposit and other debt instruments with original maturity less than one year, etc. With the objective of bringing consistency across products in terms of issuers, investors and other participants, it is proposed to rationalize existing regulations covering different money market products. These directions would improve transparency and safety of money markets.It has been the endeavour of RBI to increase retail participation in the government security market. In addition to scheduled commercial banks and primary dealers, Specified Stock Exchanges approved by Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) have already been permitted to act as Aggregators/Facilitators to aggregate the bids of their stockbrokers/other retail participants (through a web-based application provided to their clientele) and submit a single consolidated bid under the non-competitive segment of the primary auctions of Government of India securities. It has been decided to also allow the Specified Stock Exchanges to act as Aggregators/Facilitators to aggregate the bids of their stockbrokers/other retail participants and submit a single consolidated bid under the non-competitive segment of the primary auctions of State Development Loans (SDLs). The measure will be implemented in consultation with the respective State governments."
other,"A study commissioned by the nonprofit group Lauren's Kids found over one in four current or former student-athletes surveyed have been ""sexually assaulted or harassed by someone in a position of power on campus.""
According to USA Today's N'dea Yancey-Bragg, nearly 800 adults under the age of 45 responded to the digital survey that spanned both public and private universities. The data on student-athletes was bleak, with the study finding them two-and-a-half times more likely than other students to say they experienced abuse (with coaches serving as the most identified abusers). 
Only 25 percent of those student-athletes said they reported their abuse to campus administrators, with nearly half of those who declined to report the abuse choosing not to do so for fear of retaliation, including loss of scholarship.
Among non-student-athletes who responded to the survey, 10 percent reported being sexually assaulted or harassed by someone in a position of power.
Florida state Senator Lauren Book, the founder of Lauren's Kids and a survivor of sexual assault, called on colleges and universities to do more to keep students safe on campus. 
“It’s about holding everyone accountable and putting policies and procedures in place,"" Book said. 
Lawyers representing some of the athletes suing Ohio State and the University of Michigan for sexual assault at the hands of school doctors called the survey a vital look at the state of student-athlete safety.
“This is a small study but a very powerful one in my view,” attorney Ben Schulte said. “It provides real data and information for parents, people and legislatures to see what’s going on. We need more studies like this.”"
other,"For a central bank to be able to implement monetary policy objectively, it should have a degree of independence from government, be credible, and be transparent in its goals and objectives.The ultimate challenge for central banks as they try to manipulate the supply of money to influence the economy is that they cannot control the amount of money that households and corporations put in banks on deposit, nor can they easily control the willingness of banks to create money by expanding credit. Taken together, this also means that they cannot always control the money supply. Therefore, there are definite limits to the power of monetary policy.The concept of money neutrality is usually interpreted as meaning that money cannot influence the real economy in the long run. However, by the setting of its policy rate, a central bank hopes to influence the real economy via the policy rate¡¯s impact on other market interest rates, asset prices, the exchange rate, and the expectations of economic agents. Inflation targeting is the most common monetary policy¡ªalthough exchange rate targeting is also used, particularly in developing economies. Quantitative easing attempts to spur aggregate demand by drastically increasing the money supply.

"
other,"Even as inflation projections have been revised downwards significantly and some of the risks pointed out in the last resolution have been mitigated, especially of crude oil prices, several uncertainties still cloud the inflation outlook. First, inflation projections incorporate benign food prices based on the realised outcomes of food inflation in recent months. The prices of several food items are at unusually low levels and there is a risk of sudden reversal, especially of volatile perishable items. Secondly, available data suggest that the effect of revision in minimum support prices (MSPs) announced in July on prices has been subdued so far. However, uncertainty continues about the exact impact of MSP on inflation, going forward. Thirdly, the medium-term outlook for crude oil prices is still uncertain due to global demand conditions, geo-political tensions and decision of OPEC which could impinge on supplies. Fourthly, global financial markets continue to be volatile. Fifthly, though households¡¯ near-term inflation expectations have moderated in the latest round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s survey, one-year ahead expectations remain elevated and unchanged. Sixthly, fiscal slippages, if any, at the centre/state levels, will influence the inflation outlook, heighten market volatility and crowd out private investment. Finally, the staggered impact of HRA revision by State Governments may push up headline inflation. While the MPC will look through the statistical impact of HRA revisions, it will be watchful of any second-round effects on inflation.The MPC noted that the benign outlook for headline inflation is driven mainly by the unexpected softening of food inflation and collapse in oil prices in a relatively short period of time. Excluding food items, inflation has remained sticky and elevated, and the output gap remains virtually closed. The MPC also noted that even as escalating trade tensions, tightening of global financial conditions and slowing down of global demand pose some downside risks to the domestic economy, the decline in oil prices in recent weeks, if sustained, will provide tailwinds. The acceleration in investment activity also bodes well for the medium-term growth potential of the economy. The time is apposite to further strengthen domestic macroeconomic fundamentals. In this context, fiscal discipline is critical to create space for and crowd in private investment activity.Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate on hold and maintain the stance of calibrated tightening. While the decision on keeping the policy rate unchanged was unanimous, Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia voted to change the stance to neutral. The MPC reiterates its commitment to achieving the medium-term target for headline inflation of 4 per cent on a durable basis. The minutes of the MPC¡¯s meeting will be published by December 19, 2018."
earthquake,"Elazig/Turkey: Earthquake Situation Report No: 01, 24 January 2020 Background A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck Eastern Turkey at 8.55 pm local time on 24 January, at a depth of 15km and centred near the district of Sivrice in eastern Elazig province. According to Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD), the quake struck Elaz__'s Sivrice district at 8:55 p.m. (1755 GMT) from a depth of 6.7 kilometres. Soon after the initial quake, the province was shaken further by a series aftershocks ranging from between a magnitude 5.4 to 3.3. According to initial reports, the earthquake was felt in provinces as far as southern Adana and northern Samsun, along with northern Syria and Iraq. Speaking to the reporters, the officials initially announced the number of casualties as 4 but the number was later announced as 14 by AFAD. There were reports of injuries but did not provide a number. There officials also said several buildings collapsed or sustained damages following the tremors."
drought,"When a nation of 1.25 billion falls into a prolonged drought, it doesn't take long for the reservoirs to nearly run dry.
That's especially true when the monsoons arrive late, as they've done this year in India. More than 300 million of the country's residents have been directly affected by the drought, and poor yields have driven an average of nine farmers to suicide each day, according to the New York Times.
It's a very ugly situation that won't get better until the rains arrive, and even then, they'll need a lot of it to pull out of this drought.
The animated image at the top of this page shows one of India's reservoirs that has been hit especially hard by the drought – Jharkhand state's Panchet Hill reservoir. Located in far eastern India, Panchet Hill stood at just 4 percent of capacity at the beginning of this month. The first frame in the image – the one that shows the reservoir considerably more full – was taken a year ago, while the second frame shows just how far the water level has fallen in 2016.
According to NASA's Earth Observatory, June water levels at Panchet Hill are about 40 percent of capacity during a normal year, but are replenished by the monsoon rains soon after. This year, with the reservoir at just 4 percent of capacity, it'll take a lot more rain than usual to refill the reservoir, whenever the rain arrives.
The images, acquired by NASA's Operational Land Imager on the Landsat 8 satellite, show one example of a countrywide problem. India's 91 major reservoirs were a combined 16 percent of capacity as of June 9, down 79 percent from the 10-year average, NASA said. Last week, officials said the city of Mumbai only had about 25 days' worth of water left in its reservoirs, the Times of India reported, further highlighting how dire this situation has become – even in the big cities."
Typhoon,"Tropical Storm Bertha leaves its mark in the Pee Dee FLORENCE S.C. (WPDE) — Tropical Storm Bertha made its way through the Pee Dee leaving many yards and parking lots covered with water. As our ABC 15 crew was driving, they saw dozens of small roads flooded which prevented anyone to pass through. Black Creek Road, North Georgetown Drive, Bengalis Road, and Meadow Prong Road were among the many areas that dealt with flooding. The water was so high, it left many Florence residence stuck in their homes. Officials at the Florence County Emergency Management Division said in the Effingham area, the Lynches River had reached 15.9 feet, which is considered moderate-level flooding. However, they believe more problems could be on the way. ""We don't really have any water in homes at this point, we probably will when its all over with,"" said Dusty Owens, Official at Florence County Emergency Management Division. He went on to say that if you need any assistance during this time to contact the Florence County Emergency Management Division."
other,"Growth in gross fixed capital formation (GFCF), which had accelerated to a seven-quarter high of 14.4 per cent in Q4:2017-18, retained double-digit growth in Q1:2018-19 with some moderation in pace relative to the previous quarter. The share of GFCF in aggregate demand in Q1:2018-19 at 31.6 per cent was higher than 31.0 per cent a year ago, indicating improving investment demand. Robust investment activity was also reflected in several high frequency indicators such as steel consumption, cement production, and import of capital goods (Chart III.8). Strong growth in housing loans disbursed by scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) and especially housing finance companies also suggests rising investment in the construction sector.Capacity utilisation (seasonally adjusted) gained momentum and improved to 74.9 per cent in Q1:2018- 19, higher than the level recorded in the first quarter of the past year (Chart III.9). The number of stalled projects, though reported some improvement in both the private and government sectors in Q4:2017-18 and Q1:2018-19, there was a slight deterioration in government sector in Q2:2018-19 (Chart III.10).Since 2011-12, capital formation has decelerated due to the slowdown in investment in the private sector, weighed down, inter alia, by overhang of corporate debt (Chart III.11). Empirical analysis suggests that higher leverage constrains firms¡¯ ability to invest, resulting in slowdown in fresh investment (Box III.1)."
earthquake,"No tsunami was generated from a small earthquake off the southern coast of Hawaii Island Wednesday evening.
Officials said the quake happened at 6:45 p.m. at the Loihi Seamount, which is in the waters south of the island.
It registered as a 4.0 magnitude earthquake, which is too small to generate a tsunami threat.
The quake was also too far offshore to cause any damage to buildings on land.
Scientists have been monitoring increased seismic activity around Hawaii Island, but say there is no threat of an immediate volcanic eruption. However, that isn’t stopping them from urging everyone to be prepared in the event of an emergency in the distant future."
earthquake,"At least 65 people have died and more than 100 are missing after a powerful earthquake struck the southern New Zealand city of Christchurch, collapsing buildings, burying vehicles under debris and sending rescuers scrambling to help people trapped under rubble.
The 6.3-magnitude quake struck the country's second largest city on a busy weekday afternoon.
The mayor of Christchurch, Bob Parker, has declared a state of emergency and ordered people to evacuate the city centre. ""Make no mistake this is going to be a very black day for this shaken city,"" he said.
Power and water was cut and hundreds of dazed, screaming and crying residents wandered through the streets as sirens blared throughout Christchurch in the aftermath of the quake, which was centred three miles from the city. The US Geological Survey said the tremor occurred at a depth of 2.5 miles."
wildfires,"Firefighters scrambled to protect thousands of homes from a wildfire racing through brush-covered mountains north of Los Angeles on Friday that caused hundreds of evacuations and burned 21 structures.
The blaze, dubbed the Lake Fire, swelled to over 17,000 acres (6,880 hectares), forcing up to 1,500 people from their houses after erupting on Wednesday afternoon in the Angeles National Forest.
Triple digit temperatures and single digit humidity fanned flames on Friday evening, and little let-up was expected over the weekend with an excessive heat warning in effect across Southern California.
“We saw extreme fire conditions,” Los Angeles County Fire Department spokesman Frank Garrido said of the operation in steep canyons aided by firefighting helicopters.
The cause of the blaze was under investigation but human activity is likely to blame, said U.S. Forest Service spokesman Andrew Mitchell.
No casualties were reported but the blaze threatened 5,420 homes and other structures in communities about 40 miles (65 km) north of downtown Los Angeles where residents have been told to prepare for possible evacuations over the weekend, Garrido said.
Much of the area has not had a fire in 60-100 years, allowing flames to move swiftly through fuel-choked areas.
Across the United States, fires have been less ferocious so far in 2020, burning around 1.4 million fewer acres than in the same period of 2019. Conditions are expected to worsen in California next month when Santa Ana winds arrive in the south and El Diablo winds pick up in the North.
In drought-stricken Colorado, the Pine Gulch Fire, burning near Grand Junction, about 190 miles west of Denver, has blackened over 73,000 acres in remote mountain terrain, making it the fourth-largest in the state’s history."

earthquake,"A 4.7-magnitude earthquake felt throughout the state and beyond late Sunday night appears to be the biggest temblor in Arkansas in more than three decades.
Scott Ausbrooks, the geohazards supervisor for the Arkansas Geological Survey, said the shaking was the most intense of nearly 800 small earthquakes rumbling out of Faulkner County since September and ties a 4.7 quake recorded in 1976. The 4.7-magnitude is still preliminary, but Ausbrooks said Monday it was a ""low-end"" estimate and it is not expected to be downgraded.
The quake was centered near Greenbrier, where much of the seismic activity has occurred in the past six months. The shaking was felt far and wide this time, with thousands of people from Arkansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Mississippi reporting feeling it."
other,"Looking beyond Q2, rabi sowing in Q3 has so far been marginally lagging behind the acreage sown during the comparable period of the previous year. Precipitation since October has remained at around 13 per cent below the long period average (LPA). Major reservoirs, the main source of irrigation during the rabi season, were at 64 per cent of the full reservoir level vis-a-vis 67 per cent in the previous year. On the positive side, pulses sowing increased significantly as compared with a year ago, partly reflecting the impact of lifting of the export ban for all varieties of pulses. Available high-frequency indicators suggest a mixed picture of industrial activity for Q3. Core industries¡¯ growth was flat in October as all constituents barring steel and fertilisers slowed down sequentially. Coal mining, which revived strongly in Q2, slowed down too, while cement production contracted. In contrast, the Purchasing Managers¡¯ Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which fell in October, rebounded in November, driven by output and new orders. Also, according to the Reserve Bank¡¯s Industrial Outlook Survey (IOS), production is expected to pick up in Q3 as order books are rising.Services sector activity has remained mixed in October. In the transportation sector, sales of commercial vehicles decelerated; those of passenger vehicles and two-wheeler turned into contraction mode. By contrast, domestic and international air passenger and freight traffic, and railway freight expanded robustly. The Reserve Bank¡¯s survey suggests that sentiments on service sector activity for Q3 are upbeat and auto sales have rebounded in November. On the other hand, PMI for services moved into contraction zone in November.Retail inflation measured by year-on-year change in the consumer price index (CPI) recorded a seven-month high in October, driven by a sharp uptick in momentum, tempered partly by some favourable base effects. Food inflation was volatile in the last two months _ declining sharply in September and bouncing back in October _ due mainly to vegetables and fruits. Milk and eggs inflation has shown an uptick, while pulses inflation remained negative for the eleventh successive month in October. Cereal inflation remained stable. Fuel group inflation, which has been on an upward trajectory since July, accelerated further due to a sharp pick-up in inflation in liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), kerosene, coke and electricity."
other,"Moderate growth in the global economy has continued, though indicators have been somewhat mixed in recent months. Growth in the Chinese economy was a bit slower in the March quarter, but over the past year or so has been in line with the Chinese authorities' stated target. Infrastructure investment and demand for residential property continue to be important drivers of growth. In Japan, there is increased optimism regarding the outlook for the economy following fiscal and monetary policy initiatives, with measures of sentiment and forward-looking indicators of activity improving in early 2013. Elsewhere in east Asia, growth has generally eased a little in recent months following a noticeable pick-up in the December quarter. The US economy continues to grow at a moderate rate, notwithstanding the ongoing effects of fiscal consolidation. Information available to date suggests that the gradual improvement in US economic activity has not stalled following the cuts to public expenditure that came into force in early March. The euro area remains in recession and the unemployment rate across the region is high. The weak state of some key private sector balance sheets and government finances will weigh on activity in the euro area for some time and leave economies vulnerable to further adverse shocks. In recent months, there has been a decline in inflation in most regions of the world. Monetary policy settings globally are very accommodative.The outlook for global economic activity is little changed. World GDP is expected to grow at a bit over 3_ per cent in 2013, slightly below its long-run average, before picking up to 4 per cent in 2014. Growth in China is expected to remain around the rates seen in the second half of last year and provide a measure of support to activity in east Asia. The outlook in Japan has improved, while other advanced economies are expected to experience only a gradual improvement in economic conditions. Growth of Australia's major trading partners is expected to continue to exceed that of the world, reflecting the faster growth of Australia's trading partners in Asia."
Typhoon,"Tropical Storm Gonzalo forms in Caribbean, could reach hurricane strength by Thursday Uncertain trajectory means difficult to gage Gonzalo's impact on major USGC oil operations New York — Tropical Depression seven was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gonzalo early July 22 as the storm's wind speed picked up to 75 miles an hour, and expectations are for it to reach hurricane status by Thursday, according to the National Hurricane Center data. Gonzalo is the seventh named storm to form in the Atlantic Basin and is heading into the Caribbean, but ""the small size of this system makes is susceptible to significant fluctuations, both upward and downward,"" the latest NHC public advisory said. But as Gonzalo moves quickly west into the Caribbean, ""interests in the Windward Islands should monitor the progress of this system,"" the latest NHC public advisory said. The agency has issued no warnings or watches yet for Gonzalo. Current NHC predictions have Gonzalo moving over Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela by early Sunday morning into the mouth of the southern Gulf of Mexico. And while the NHC said it expects strengthening to continue ""over the next couple days with a levelling off"" it is too soon to gage what impact if any it will have on oil and gas infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico."
valcano eruption,"‘Huge’ explosion rocks Caribbean island as volcano keeps erupting KINGSTOWN, St. Vincent — La Soufriere volcano fired an enormous amount of ash and hot gas early Monday in the biggest explosive eruption yet since volcanic activity began on the eastern Caribbean island of St. Vincent late last week, with officials worried about the lives of those who refused to evacuate. Experts called it a “huge explosion” that generated pyroclastic flows down the volcano’s south and southwest flanks. “It’s destroying everything in its path,” Erouscilla Joseph, director of the University of the West Indies’ Seismic Research Center, told the Associated Press. “Anybody who would have not heeded the evacuation, they need to get out immediately.”"
flood,"Flash flood forces Lawas Airport to close for two days MIRI, May 20 — Heavy rain in Lawas District last night saw the Lawas River overflow and inundate the Lawas Airport runway.  The flash flood forced the authorities to close the airport for two days.  Minister of Transport Datuk Lee Kim Shin said rural air service operator MASwings has cancelled 11 flights.  There were six flights between Miri and Lawas scheduled for today and another five tomorrow.  Fire and Rescue Department Limbang chief Awangku Mohd Hazmin Awang Zainal said the runway was still under about half a metre of water as of 7.30am.  “This phenomenon usually takes between eight and 12 hours to subside,” he said.  He said this is likely to happen as the rain had stopped although it was still cloudy this morning."
other,"Global economic activity has slowed down since the meeting of the MPC in June 2019, amidst elevated trade tensions and geo-political uncertainty. Among advanced economies (AEs), GDP growth in the US decelerated in Q2:2019 on weak business fixed investment. In the Euro area too, GDP growth moderated in Q2 on worsening external conditions. Economic activity in the UK was subdued in Q2 with waning consumer confidence on account of Brexit related uncertainty and weak industrial production. In Japan, available data on industrial production and consumer confidence suggest that growth is likely to be muted in Q2.Economic activity remained weak in major emerging market economies (EMEs), pulled down mainly by slowing external demand. The Chinese economy decelerated to a multi-year low in Q2, while in Russia subdued economic activity in Q1 continued into Q2 on slowing exports and retail sales. In Brazil, the economy is struggling to gain momentum after contracting in Q1 on weak service sector activity and declining industrial production. Economic activity in South Africa appears to be losing pace in Q2 as the manufacturing purchasing managers¡¯ index (PMI) contracted for the sixth month in succession in June and business confidence remained weak.Crude oil prices fell sharply in mid-May on excess supplies from an increase in non-OPEC production, combined with a further weakening of demand. Consequently, extension of OPEC production cuts in early July did not have much impact on prices. Gold prices have risen sharply since the last week of May, propelled by increased safe haven demand amidst rising downside risks to growth and a worsening geo-political situation. Inflation remained benign in major advanced and emerging market economies.Financial markets were driven by the monetary policy stances of major central banks and intensifying geo-political tensions. In the US, the equity market recovered most of the losses suffered in May, boosted by dovish guidance by the US Fed and some transient respite in trade tensions with China. EM stocks lagged behind their developed market counterparts, mainly reflecting the weak performance of Chinese and South Korean stocks. Bond yields in the US, which were already trading with a softening bias on increased probability of policy rate cuts, fell markedly in early August on escalation of trade tensions. Bond yields in some more member countries in the Euro area moved into negative territory as expectations of more accommodative monetary policy by the European Central Bank gained traction. In EMEs, bond yields edged lower on more accommodative guidance by systemic central banks. In currency markets, the US dollar weakened against major currencies in June on dovish guidance by the US Fed but appreciated in July. EME currencies, which traded with an appreciating bias in July, depreciated in early August on escalation of trade tensions."
wildfires,"Greek authorities have deployed dozens of firefighters, as well as six water-dropping planes and four aircraft to a wildfire that broke out Monday morning in the Keratea region southeast of Athens.
Strong winds blowing in the area near the national park of Sounion were fanning the flames and hampering firefighting efforts. Authorities issued evacuation orders for three settlements in the area.
Greece has been roiled by hundreds of wildfires for about two weeks, with the blazes destroying tens of thousands of hectares of forest and farmland, burning homes and businesses and leading to the evacuation of dozens of villages. One volunteer firefighter has died, and four have been hospitalized, including two in critical condition in intensive care units.
The fires stretched Greeces response capabilities to the limit, leading the government to appeal for international help. About 24 European and Middle Eastern countries sent firefighters, helicopters, planes and vehicles. By Monday most had left, although 40 Austrian firefighters remained in the southern Greek region of the Peloponnese, where two major fires have been burning for several days.
Several Mediterranean countries have suffered intense heat and quickly spreading wildfires in recent weeks, including Turkey, where at least eight people have died, and Italy. In Algeria, wildfires in the mountainous Berber region have killed at least 69 people.
Worsening drought and heat have also fueled wildfires this summer in the Western United States and in Russias northern Siberia region. Scientists say there is little doubt that climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas is driving more extreme weather events.
Two major fires which began in early August, one on the island of Evia and one in a national park north of the Greek capital, were still smoldering Monday, with firefighters deployed to secure their perimeters, the fire department said."
other,"In this reading, we have sought to explain the practices of both monetary and fiscal policy. Both can have a significant impact on economic activity, and it is for this reason that financial analysts need to be aware of the tools of both monetary and fiscal policy, the goals of the monetary and fiscal authorities, and most important the monetary and fiscal policy transmission mechanisms.Governments can influence the performance of their economies by using combinations of monetary and fiscal policy. Monetary policy refers to central bank activities that are directed toward influencing the quantity of money and credit in an economy. By contrast, fiscal policy refers to the government¡¯s decisions about taxation and spending. The two sets of policies affect the economy via different mechanisms.Money fulfills three important functions: It acts as a medium of exchange, provides individuals with a way of storing wealth, and provides society with a convenient unit of account. Via the process of fractional reserve banking, the banking system can create money."
other,"In domestic financial markets, various segments have exhibited diverse movements. While money markets remained laden with the overhang of liquidity that characterised the first half of the year, surplus liquidity has gradually ebbed and turned into deficit since February. As recourse to primary liquidity became pronounced from mid-December, overnight interest rates have begun ¡®middling¡¯ within the LAF corridor more frequently (Chart IV.1). Little farther out on the term curve, however, interest rates on Treasury bills (T-Bills) and discount rates on commercial papers (CPs) are hardening as markets sense that liquidity conditions are balancing out. In bond markets, long-term yields rose unrelentingly from August on apprehensions of excessive issuances, reactions to fiscal slippages following the announcement of the Union Budget for 2018-19, and rising inflation expectations peaking in early March. A spike in international crude price and rise in global interest rates contributed to the hardening of yields. Thereafter, yields declined sharply on favourable inflation print for February 2018 and in response to the lower than expected borrowings indicated by the Government in the issuance calendar for H1:2018-19. Corporate bonds also rose in sync, although credit spreads moderated with the improving outlook on growth.Until the Budget announcement, equity markets scaled new peaks, riding on aggressive buying by domestic mutual funds and foreign portfolio investors. Thereafter, corrections are occurring with bearish sentiment being more freely expressed in the equity market. The Union Budget proposal to levy long-term capital gains tax (LTCG) of 10 per cent on gains exceeding _1 lakh from sale of equity shares, sharp increase in US bond yields, the announcement of protectionist tariffs by the US and revelations of fraud in some domestic banks have impacted equity markets adversely since the beginning of February. The foreign exchange segment has moved in tandem; while the rupee had gained against the US dollar on the back of sustained portfolio inflows with the ebullience in equity markets, sentiment had reversed after the Budget announcement and portfolio outflows picked up from mid-February as global cues weighed on the rupee.In the credit market, activity is slowly gaining strength, despite the overhang of corporate loan delinquencies. The total flow of financial resources to the commercial sector in 2017-18 was much higher than that during the previous year, primarily due to an increase in non-food credit by banks. Credit demand surged in the second half of 2017-18 - though at divergent pace across bank-groups - with the growth pick-up spreading across sectors as underlying macroeconomic conditions improved. Both deposit and lending rates eased up to November as the cumulative reduction in the policy rate of 200 basis points since January 2015 was fully transmitted to new loans."
earthquake,"A magnitude seven earthquake has struck the southern Philippines but there were no immediate reports of damage and a tsunami warning was not issued.
The earthquake hit about 310 kilometres (193 miles) southeast of Davao city on the main southern island of Mindanao at 8:23pm (12:23 GMT), according to the US Geological Survey (USGS).
Residents in the town of Jose Abad Santos, near the southern tip of the island, lost electricity for about 15 minutes after the earthquake shook the region but there was no damage, police chief Captain Glabynarry Murillo told the AFP news agency.
“From our vantage point at the police station, we saw many residents rushing outside,” said Murillo. “We also rushed outside because the police station is a three-storey building.”"
other,"MAS maintained the S$NEER policy band on a modest and gradual appreciation path in the last policy review in October 2011.  However, the slope of the policy band was reduced as economic activity was expected to slow, and hence ease the tightness in the labour market and alleviate core inflationary pressures. Over the last six months, the S$NEER was largely in the lower half of the policy band.  It weakened in November 2011 due to heightened global risk aversion arising from the sovereign debt crisis in the Eurozone.  However, it has since appreciated to around the mid-point of the policy band as investor sentiment picked up following improved macroeconomic data from the US and indications of some stabilisation in the Eurozone.  The domestic three-month interbank rate rose to 0.50% in November, before falling to 0.38% in December, where it has remained since."
wildfires,"Experts fear that a sharp drought and ongoing deforestation could trigger a repeat of the large fires of August 2019. Government efforts implemented in May to stop fires don’t appear to have been effective.
The number of forest fires in Brazil's Amazon rainforest increased 28% in July in comparison to last year, the country's National Institute for Space Research reported Saturday.
Brazil holds around 60% of the Amazon basin region and environmentalists say this area is vital to containing the impact of climate change.
The state agency recorded 6,803 fires in the Amazon last month, compared to 5,318 in the same month of 2019.
Environmentalists were alarmed by the figure, particularly because August traditionally marks the beginning of the fire season in the region. Many now fear that a repeat of the large surge in fires that devastated the area last August could occur this year again.
 ""More than 1,000 fires in a single day is a 15-year record and shows the government's strategy of media-spectacle operations is not working on the ground,"" Greenpeace spokesman Romulo Batista said in a statement.
The fires have been largely set to clear land illegally for farming, ranching and mining. Activists accuse Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro of encouraging the deforestation, as he has been in favor of opening up the rainforest to agriculture and industry.
The first six months of 2020 were already the worst on record for deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, with 3,069 square kilometers (1,185 square miles) cleared, according to INPE data, an area larger than the nation of Luxembourg."
earthquake,"Russia: Earthquake of 7.5 magnitude hits Kuril Islands The world hasn’t even started coping up from world’s most disastrous pandemic, coronavirus, and another disaster struck Russia last Wednesday. According to the US Geological Servey, an earthquake hit Kuril Islands, Russia at a depth of 56.7 km with a magnitude of 7.5. Warnings of Tsunami Though there were no casualties reported during the earthquake. A more significant warning is knocking at the door. The authorities are predicting a tsunami which got its cancellation later. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre (PTWC) said tsunami waves could hit within 1000 km of the epicentre of the earthquake. But after some time, the authorities denied it and said quakes of this magnitude made the Tsunami go far away from the epicenter. In addition to that, they added that only tiny tsunami waves were present. Therefore, there is no threat to Russia, as of now."
drought,"Government plans to link Bhima and Manjara rivers in Maharashtra to tackle water crisis situation in drought-hit Marathwada region of the state in the long-run, Rajya Sabha was informed today.
Union Minister of State for Water Resources Sanwar Lal Jat said this in response to queries on the action the Centre is taking to figure long-term solutions for water shortage in Marathwada and Bundelkhand regions.
“The long-term measures in Marathawada, inter alia, include interlinking of Bhima and Manjara rivers,” he said.
Jat said, as part of the government’s efforts, the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) has prioritised Bundelkhand and parts of Marathwada for aquifer mapping and management program “in order to delineate aquifer disposition and their charecterisation along with quantification and for preparation of aquifer/area specific ground water management plans”.
The minister also said the CGWB had in 2013 prepared a conceptual document titled ‘Master Plan for Artificial Recharge to Ground Water in India’ which envisages construction of different types of artificial recharge and rainwater harvesting structures in the country including the two drought-hit regions.
Jat said, the government has deputed technical teams comprising officers of Central Water Commission (CWC) and CGWB for on the spot study of water situation and interaction with the state governments.
Asked whether water level in the two regions have plunged to 500 ft below ground-level, Jat differed, saying the deepest ground water level recorded in Marathwada region is 45.62 m (140 ft), while that in Bundelkhand is 49.4 m – both according to a January 2016 assessment.
Responding to another question, he said four major dams monitored by CWC, namely Jayakwadi, Bhima, Yeldari and Girna, have reported zero water stock level as per the latest bulletin for week ending on April 21."

flood,"Typhoon Molave makes landfall in Vietnam in the aftermath of deadly floods Typhoon Molave made landfall just south of the Vietnamese resort city Da Nang on Wednesday, lashing the coast with powerful rains and winds, and inflicting further misery on an area still reeling from widespread deadly flooding.  Molave hit as the equivalent of a Category 2 Atlantic hurricane, packing sustained winds of 165 kilometers per hour (103 miles per hour). The storm is expected to bring rains and dangerous winds as it pushes over the mountains of Southeast Asia, causing potential flash floods and landslides. ""This is a very strong typhoon that will impact a large area,"" Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said before the storm made landfall. Some 310,000 homes were already damaged from last week's deadly flooding, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), with the organization warning that close to 1.2 million people were ""in severe danger and in need of relief."" ""It is estimated that at least 150,000 people are at immediate risk of food shortages and hunger after thousands of hectares of crops have been destroyed,"" the IFRC said last week. Vietnamese authorities made plans to evacuate about 1.3 million people ahead of Typhoon Molave's landfall, and the military mobilized about 250,000 troops and 2,300 vehicles to be used for search and rescue missions, state-run Vietnam News Agency reported."
other,"Financial market conditions in the second half of 2017-18 were marked by the weighted average call money rate (WACR) moving closer to the policy repo rate as surplus liquidity moderated; stock markets scaling new highs before undergoing some corrections; firming up of bond yields; and, the foreign exchange market switching from buoyant to ebbing portfolio flows. As credit offtake picked up, monetary policy transmission gained further traction for new loans.Global financial markets generally remained buoyant through the second half of 2017, boosted by the improving macroeconomic outlook and the gradual normalisation of the US monetary policy. While equity markets surged on a renewed appetite for risk, currencies were lifted by the weakening of the US dollar since November. Yield curves in bond markets tended to flatten with still subdued inflation expectations, and corporate credit spreads narrowed. In 2018, however, market sentiment has been dampened by accelerating wage and employment growth in the US, triggering fears of a faster pace of interest rate increases. Longer term interest rates have been hardening tracking US yields, but also in response to country-specific developments. oscillating geo-political developments and more recent fears of a trade war in response to the US tariff announcements have heightened uncertainty considerably. Volatility has pervaded various market segments, with equity and bond market sell offs spilling across geographies. Currency markets have been hit by the turbulence of safe haven flights that are rotating capital flows among emerging economies and sporadically strengthening the US dollar. Financial markets have remained on edge in recent weeks."
Typhoon,"At least 17 people have been killed in Japan by powerful typhoon Wipha, according to media reports.
The typhoon hit Izu Oshima, an island south of Japan’s capital city Tokyo, on Wednesday morning. It threw life out of gear by causing landslides and flooding in the island. More than 80 centimetres of rain fell in a span of 24 hours in the island.
Around 50 people have been reported missing.  Japan Meteorological Agency had earlier called the typhoon as once-in-a-decade-event.
The typhoon has been downgraded to a “tropical storm” and is heading north-east. Reports also say that Fukushima nuclear plant, which was badly hit when a tsunami and an earthquake struck simultaneously in March 2011, did not face much damage. Nuclear plant authorities were quoted saying, “the typhoon has caused no new damage to the plant”.
It has also been reported that many houses have been buried in mudslides, triggered by the rain, trapping people underneath. Rescue operations are on and flights and trains in Tokyo have been cancelled."
other,"The Singapore economy has expanded at a rapid pace in 2007, underpinned by robust growth in non-IT manufacturing and asset market-related activities in the first half of the year.  Going forward, while the economy is expected to moderate to a more sustainable pace, inflationary pressures stemming from external sources, as well as domestic conditions including a tight labour market and rising rental costs, will persist. Against this backdrop, MAS will continue with the policy of a modest and gradual appreciation of the S$NEER policy band in the period ahead.  However, we will increase slightly the slope of the S$NEER policy band.  There will be no re-centring of the policy band, or any change in its width.  In our assessment, this policy stance will remain supportive of economic growth while capping inflationary pressures and ensuring price stability over the medium term."
wildfires,"A fast-growing wildfire along the Pacific Coast Highway northwest of Los Angeles nearly doubled in size Friday and was threatening more than 4,000 homes as crews battled strong winds, tinder-dry conditions and record-breaking temperatures.
The Springs Fire had burned more than 28,000 acres of rugged, brush-covered terrain by late afternoon and was 20% contained, the state's fire agency reported.
Forecasters said a weekend of increased humidity should help teams fighting the early-season blaze make gains Saturday.
""It's a total turnaround from what we had,"" said Kurt Kaplan, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Oxnard. ""It should be a much better day for firefighters tomorrow.""
At midday Friday, the temperature hit a record 96 in Camarillo, where the blaze began, about 50 miles north of Los Angeles.
Thousands of residents had already evacuated the Ventura County fire, including 118 families ordered from a premier Navy base because of heavy smoke after flames jumped the scenic highway.
The fire began Thursday during the morning rush hour near U.S. 101, which is the major commuter route into Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley. After reaching the coast overnight, the fire headed back inland Friday.
The fire had damaged 15 homes and destroyed at least 25 outbuildings and other property by midday. Large animals and livestock were being taken to the county fairgrounds.
No operations were affected Friday morning at the sprawling Naval Base Ventura County, which was already operating on an ""essential mission"" basis. The base has a population of more than 19,000 personnel and operates two runways, a sea-test range and deep-water port.
The evacuation order only affected the San Miguel housing unit for the Point Mugu air station. ""This is due to smoke, rather than fire, concerns,"" public affairs officer Kimberly Gearhart announced on the base's Facebook page."
other,"Monetary policy refers to the steps taken by a country¡¯s central bank to control the money supply for economic stability. For example, policymakers manipulate money circulation for increasing employment, GDP, price stability by using tools such as interest rates, reserves, bonds, etc.Monetary policy is the central bank¡¯s action to establish economic stability in a nation and fulfil other goals like unemployment, inflation, price instability, recession, etc.It is considered to be a corrective measure since such a policy reform is made to control the prevailing economic situation or adversity.There are two forms of monetary policy, i.e., the contractionary and expansionary policy.The tools or measures initiated by the central bank under this policy include changes in the discount rate, open market operations and reserve requirements."
other,"The Singapore economy has rebounded from the downturn and is expected to continue on its firm recovery path given the more favourable global economic outlook.  At the same time, inflationary pressures are likely to pick up, driven by rising global commodity prices as well as some domestic cost factors.MAS will therefore re-centre the exchange rate policy band at the prevailing level of the S$NEER.  Further, we will shift the policy band from that of a zero percent appreciation to one of modest and gradual appreciation.  There will be no change to the width of the policy band.  MAS will continue to be vigilant over developments in the external environment and their impact on the domestic economy, and stands ready to curb excessive volatility in the S$NEER."
flood,"River crests without flooding Chuck Magaha said he kind of feels like he cried wolf last week.  The director of Leavenworth County Emergency Management alerted various officials Friday after the National Weather Service issued a flood warning for the Missouri River.  The Missouri River rose rapidly Friday following heavy rainfall to the north. But the river crested without ever reaching its flood stage for the Leavenworth area.  ""It was frustrating, but there's nothing you can do when you're dealing with Mother Nature,"" he said.  Magaha said the flood forecast for the river was based on additional rainfall that was anticipated in the area. He said there was additional rain Friday, but it was less than what had been expected."
other,"Chairman Frank, Ranking Member Bachus, and other members of the Committee, I am pleased to present the Federal Reserve's Monetary Policy Report to the Congress.  In my testimony this morning I will briefly review the economic situation and outlook, beginning with developments in real activity and inflation, then turn to monetary policy.  I will conclude with a quick update on the Federal Reserve's recent actions to help protect consumers in their financial dealings.The economic situation has become distinctly less favorable since the time of our July report.  Strains in financial markets, which first became evident late last summer, have persisted; and pressures on bank capital and the continued poor functioning of markets for securitized credit have led to tighter credit conditions for many households and businesses.  The growth of real gross domestic product (GDP) held up well through the third quarter despite the financial turmoil, but it has since slowed sharply.  Labor market conditions have similarly softened, as job creation has slowed and the unemployment rate--at 4.9 percent in January--has moved up somewhat.Many of the challenges now facing our economy stem from the continuing contraction of the U.S. housing market.  In 2006, after a multiyear boom in residential construction and house prices, the housing market reversed course.  Housing starts and sales of new homes are now less than half of their respective peaks, and house prices have flattened or declined in most areas.  Changes in the availability of mortgage credit amplified the swings in the housing market.  During the housing sector's expansion phase, increasingly lax lending standards, particularly in the subprime market, raised the effective demand for housing, pushing up prices and stimulating construction activity.  As the housing market began to turn down, however, the slump in subprime mortgage originations, together with a more general tightening of credit conditions, has served to increase the severity of the downturn.  Weaker house prices in turn have contributed to the deterioration in the performance of mortgage-related securities and reduced the availability of mortgage credit."
valcano eruption,"Guatemala volcano eruption: Latest death toll of deadly eruption GUATEMALA’S Fuego volcano shot fast-moving currents of ash, lava and super-heated gas down its slopes on June 3, burying villages in its path. The eruption was the worst in four decades and has killed more than a hundred people, but what is the latest death toll? The latest death toll of Guatemala’s Fuego volcano eruption has risen to 114, according to authorities. Conrad national disaster agency entered so-called ‘Ground Zero’ in the community of San Miguel Los Lotes in Escuintla province, which was buried under volcanic ash and destroyed by pyroclastic flows. Search operations had to be suspended on Monday because of heavy rain. Insivumeh scientific agency reports volcanic activity within the mountain continues."
Typhoon,"President Benigno Aquino has travelled to areas in the southern Philippines devastated by a powerful typhoon that struck earlier this week.
Meeting survivors in New Bataan, the scene of deadly flash floods, he said efforts had to be made to ensure such a disaster was not repeated.
A total of 418 people are now confirmed dead and another 383 remain missing, official figures show.
More than 300,000 people are currently staying in evacuation centres.
Typhoon Bopha struck the southern island of Mindanao on Tuesday. High winds and heavy rain damaged a swathe of the island, but the worst-hit areas were two eastern provinces, Compostela Valley and Davao Oriental.
In New Bataan, in Compostela Valley, several buildings - including emergency shelters - were washed away or buried by flash floods and mudslides.
""We want to find out why this tragedy happened and how to keep these tragedies from happening again,"" Mr Aquino was quoted by AFP news agency as telling local residents.
""I am here to listen and hear explanations. This is not a time for accusations. It is a time for work,"" he said.
The typhoon destroyed almost 16,000 houses, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council said, forcing families to seek shelter elsewhere.
Damage so far has been estimated at 4bn pesos ( $100m, ?60m)."
drought,"The water crisis along the California - Oregon border has reached catastrophic levels, on course to becoming the worst in generations amid historic drought in the area. Federal regulators have shut off irrigation water to farmers, severely impacting the agricultural sector.
The water crisis along the region has gone from dire to catastrophic this week. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation said it will not release water this season into the main canal that supplies the Klamath Reclamation Project-- a first time for the 114-year-old irrigation system. 
The entire region is in extreme drought conditions, with Oregon's Klamath County facing its driest in 127 years.
""This year’s drought conditions are bringing unprecedented hardship to the communities of the Klamath Basin,"" said Reclamation Deputy Commissioner Camille Calimlim Touton, dubbing the decision one of ""historic consequence.""
""Reclamation is dedicated to working with our water users, tribes, and partners to get through this difficult year and developing long-term solutions for the basin.""
The canal funnels Klamath River water from the Upper Klamath Lake just north of the Oregon-California border to over 52 600 ha (130 000 acres), where farmers have grown crops for generations.
According to the Klamath Water Users Association, only one irrigation district will receive water from the river system this growing system but will have a severely limited supply.
""This just couldn’t be worse,"" said Ty Kliewer, president of the Klamath Irrigation District. The impacts to our family farms and these rural communities will be off the scale.""
The river houses the endangered coho salmon, which are vital to the culture of the Yurok Tribe-- California's largest federally recognized tribe.
""Right now, the Klamath River is full of dead and dying fish on the Yurok Reservation,"" said Yurok Tribe Vice Chairman Frankie Myers."
wildfires,"The Parana River in Argentina -- South America's second-biggest river after the Amazon and the eighth longest in the world -- is at its lowest level in decades this year, allowing multiple forest fires to spread through its delta.
NASA's Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat-8 captured a satellite image of the river near Rosario on July 3, 2020, showing the parched land compared to an old image taken on July 1, 2019, when water levels were high.
The Parana is South America's second-biggest river after the Amazon and the eighth longest in the world. 
As the shrinking river caused economic damage, it also allowed increased fire activity in the delta.
Giant plumes of smoke have been whipping across the region since February, and have even covered the streets of Rosario at times and other places along the Parana. As a result, the air in Rosario was unbreathable for weeks.
""The other night I walked to the river and could see seven fires burning in the distance,"" biologist Jorge Liotta told the Guardian late July.
""It depends on the wind if the smoke hits you, but when it does, the smoke is so thick that the sun turns red and you can barely see the house next door. What’s worse, it gets inside your home. People with asthma and other breathing difficulties are really suffering.”
Greenpeace Argentina spokesperson Leonel Mingo said, ""everything is burning, it's completely out of control,"" warning that once a fire reaches a certain scale, ""it becomes virtually impossible to stop.""
While the Parana River Basin was drenched by some rain in June and July, river watchers do not expect the river to fully recover until sustained wet seasonal rains come in October."
wildfires,"Portuguese rescue workers evacuated some 100 people from the Peneda-Geres National Park on Thursday as wildfires in the north of the country intensified despite non-stop efforts by more than a thousand firefighters.
Interior Minister Rui Pereira told a news briefing the situation in the arid northern woodlands ""is comparable to a true theatre of war"".
He also praised firefighters for their bravery after two died and several were badly injured in forest fires this week.
He said the government had activated the European Union's Civil Protection Mechanism to get additional firefighting equipment and was doing all in its power to prevent wildfires from spreading further. Scorching heat and winds were ""particularly adverse"" this year, he said.
In total, fire brigades were combating more than 30 fires in Portugal on Thursday afternoon.
Officials said some 120 firemen with 20 trucks and four aircraft were working to put out the flames that threatened the homes of those evacuated in Vilar de Soente, in the Peneda-Geres reserve not far from the border with Spain's Galicia region.
In the mountainous Serra de Estrela nature reserve, the Tour of Portugal international cycling event was forced to shorten the day's route by 40 km (25 miles) due to fires in the area, organisers said.
Television footage showed airplanes and heavy helicopters dumping tonnes of water on the burning forest while police and firefighters blocked roads nearby, with flames arching above the melting asphalt. Pereira said hundreds of fires were registered every day in the country. Firefighters put out 95 percent of them the same day.
Many districts in the north have raised the fire threat level to the highest possible this week. Hundreds of troops were deployed to help the fire brigades.
Forest fires are common in Portugal and southern Europe in the summer months, caused by high temperatures, recklessness and often arsonists. The area of the forest destroyed by wildfires so far lags last year, which was a four-year record."
flood,"Louisiana storm death toll climbs to 5; hundreds dealing with flood damage The flooding, which began with heavy rain early this week, hit some areas that were struck by two hurricanes last year. The number of deaths related to a deluge of rain that hit parts of Louisiana this week has risen to five, health officials said Thursday, and more rain is forecast for a region that has already seen flash flooding.  The Vermilion Parish coroner ruled that the death of a 46-year-old man whose vehicle crashed into floodwaters was storm-related, the state Health Department said."
other,"Lawmakers and law enforcement officials are growing concerned about the possibility of violence and unrest on Capitol Hill as two key dates approach next month: a right-wing rally in support of the jailed January 6 rioters and the 20th anniversary of 9/11.
Those fresh fears come as the community is still reeling from a recent bomb scare near the complex involving a man critical of Democrats, including President Joe Biden. The event ended without incident, but still sent a chill through Capitol Hill and provided law enforcement yet another example of the risks of a toxic political climate.
Now, as security preparations ramp up for a ""Justice for J6"" rally planned for September 18 on the Capitol grounds, serious discussions are underway about reinstalling the temporary fencing around the Capitol's perimeter, according to multiple sources familiar with the planning.
Some members of Congress are also amplifying their warnings that far-right conspiracy theories, extremist online rhetoric and the GOP's continued embrace of former President Donald Trump's lies about the 2020 election could lead to more politically motivated attacks that could impact Capitol Hill and beyond.
""You don't get an insurrection on January 6 and all threats of violence go away. In fact, the fear is that future planning will produce other violent acts,"" said Rep. Madeleine Dean, a Pennsylvania Democrat.
""I'm most concerned for my staff ... and I also worry for the Capitol Police,"" she added. ""They are strained, they have been heroic and they saved all of our lives at great peril to themselves."""
other,"In its October 2020 Monetary Policy Statement, MAS kept the rate of appreciation of the S$NEER policy band at zero percent per annum, with no change to the width of the policy band or the level at which it was centred. This policy stance was assessed to be appropriate in view of the weak outlook for core inflation. While core inflation was expected to rise and gradually turn positive this year, it would stay well below its long-term average.Over the last six months, the S$NEER has fluctuated slightly above the mid-point of the policy band. The S$NEER has appreciated modestly, reflecting in part the strengthening of the S$ against most reserve currencies as global risk sentiment improved. The three-month S$ SIBOR was broadly unchanged at 0.4%."
earthquake,"The most surprising thing about the magnitude-8.9 earthquake that hit Japan today is that it was a surprise. Despite what may be the world's most intensive effort to map faults and assess risks by a notoriously earthquake-prone and earthquake-conscious nation, such a strong quake was not anticipated for the region, says University of Tokyo geophysicist Robert Geller.
The earthquake occurred 130 kilometers east of Sendai and 373 kilometers northeast of Tokyo, along or very near the boundary between two tectonic plates, where the Pacific plate is being drawn under the Japanese islands. Movement along plate boundaries is known to be capable of producing major earthquakes. And Japan's latest national seismic risk map gave a 99% chance of a magnitude-7.5 or greater quake occurring in that area in the next 30 years, Geller says.
Although today's quake technically satisfies that prediction, the logarithmic scale used for measuring the power of earthquakes means that a magnitude-8.9 earthquake releases well over 100 times more energy than does a magnitude-7.5 quake. ""I don't think those hazard assessments are meaningful,"" Geller says."
drought,"This is what pastoralists have done for centuries, following the movements of their animals and the changing seasons. However, because of the drought's effects on the Horn of Africa, these nine families have had to move six times in the last six months. They continue to seek drinkable water for themselves and their animals, hoping they will be able to hold out for the soon-to-come rainy season.
Nine pastoralist families’ lives, their wealth (their animals), and even their homes are all being transported towards a new site – where they hope they will be able to hold out for the soon-to-come rainy season.
The region was hit by an 18-month drought caused by El Niño and higher temperatures linked to climate change. Now, in the midst of even more drought, the situation has become catastrophic, causing crops to fail and cattle to die. In addition, the lack of clean water increases the threat of cholera and other diseases.
Across Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, and the autonomous region of Somaliland, 10.7 million people are facing severe hunger. There are increasing concerns that the situation will get much worse, as rainfall in March and early April was very low in places. Poor rainfall is forecast for April through June, the end of the rainy season."
drought,"The epic drought that began in the state of California in December 2011 and only officially ended in March of this year will have many lasting impacts—but one of the most severe is what it did to the trees in the central and southern Sierra Nevada mountains. A new study in the journal Nature Geosciences reports that by the drought’s peak, a combination of factors—including lack of rain, extreme heat and overcrowding stressed out the forest—lead to mass die-offs. In total, almost 150 million trees have died in California since the drought began.
Nathanael Johnson at Grist reports that to understand the tree-mageddon, researchers analyzed various forest communities in the mountains, including areas where 80 percent of the trees died and other where as few as two percent of the trees were lost."
other,"Nearly 107 million US households -- about 61% -- owed no federal income tax in 2020, a huge spike from pre-pandemic times. But that increase should be short-lived.
The coronavirus-fueled upheaval in the economy, which cost more than 20 million jobs in April 2020, and the sweeping federal relief packages drove up the share of non-payers by roughly 40%, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.
Only about 75 million households, or 44%, didn't pay federal income tax in 2019, said Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the center, who called the increase for 2020 ""eye-popping, but temporary.""
Many people who lost their jobs or had their hours curtailed last year were lower-wage workers who may have paid little income tax prior to the pandemic. In addition, millions of Americans received up to $1,800 each in stimulus checks, which were actually refundable tax credits that significantly reduced people's 2020 tax liability, as part of two congressional rescue deals.
Together, these meant that far fewer households had to pay federal income tax."
drought,"About half the population of southern Madagascar or 1.5 million people is suffering from drought-driven hunger, the UN World Food Program (WFP) reported on November 30, 2020. Three straight years of drought have eradicated harvests and hampered people's access to food.
""The hunger and malnutrition we're seeing is the result of three years of ruined harvests,"" said Moumini Ouedraogo, WFP’s Representative in Madagascar.
""Families across these drought-afflicted areas are adopting desperate measures simply to survive-- selling precious belongings such as cattle, farm tools, and kitchen utensils,""
In October, WFP started providing food aid for 320 000 severely food-insecure people in the 10 worst-hit districts, with hot meals for malnourished children and elderly in Amboasary, the epicenter of the crisis.
""The situation in the South demands an urgent response. People are left with nothing to eat and we must support them before it is too late, but for that to happen, urgent support from donors is needed now,"" Ouedraogo added.
The current resources can only accommodate 500 000 people through December, so the WFP appealed for 37.5 million dollars to rapidly expand its response, as well as to prevent child malnutrition rates from further worsening. The organization seeks to reach 891 000 people through June 2021.
The funds will also be allocated for emergency school feeding so children can continue studying, which WFP noted as the ""essential key to a better future.""
""The latest hunger surge underscores the magnitude of food insecurity across Madagascar, where almost half of the children under five are chronically malnourished, or physically stunted, meaning their brains and bodies may be irreversibly compromised,"" said WFP"
drought,"As parts of the Western US emerge from one of the driest winter seasons on record, the expectation of yet another summer of wildfires will be familiar to many.
Scientists, in fact, are already issuing warnings of an increased risk of wildfires in places such as California for 2021, and other parts of the Western US, as the San Francisco Chronicle recently reported.
The region, where wildfires are increasingly common, is ripe for wildfires following a winter with extremely dry conditions _ and reportedly the third worst ever seen.
And it could for a single reason _ what is being described by scientists as the second worst drought for 1,200 years.

The Western US, a region at the front of the world’s fight against a warming climate, is on the verge of a “mega drought”, according to a report by CBS, following analysis of the US Drought Monitor and warnings from scientists.
The period of so-called “mega drought”, of which the consequences are only starting to be seen, is thought to have begun in 2000, with peaks in periods of severe drought _ and wildfires.
As shown in figures from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the period was responsible for the two worst droughts to occur, in 2003 and 2013.
Figures for 2020-2021 are more alarming, with the amount of area being in a state of ""exceptional drought"" at 20 per cent _ wider than at any point for 20 years."
other,"In sum, since the February Monetary Policy Report, further important progress has been made in restoring the economy to health and in strengthening the financial system. Yet too many Americans remain unemployed, inflation remains below our longer-run objective, and not all of the necessary financial reform initiatives have been completed. The Federal Reserve remains committed to employing all of its resources and tools to achieve its macroeconomic objectives and to foster a stronger and more resilient financial system."
other,"Australia's economic performance during 2006 continued to be marked by strong growth in incomes and employment. Capacity utilisation remained high and there was a pick-up in underlying inflationary pressures in the first half of the year. These developments took place against the backdrop of above-average global growth and high commodity prices.Recent indications are that the world economy is continuing to grow strongly. The US economy has remained robust, and concerns that a downturn in the housing sector would significantly dampen activity have not so far been borne out. Information on other parts of the world remains consistent with expectations of strong aggregate growth. The Chinese economy has continued to expand at a double-digit rate, with recent policy measures having had some success in encouraging a shift from investment to consumer spending. In Japan, despite more moderate growth recently, improving conditions in the business sector and the labour market point to good prospects for further expansion. Growth in the rest of east Asia has remained firm, and in the euro area the indications are that a moderate pace of expansion is continuing. Overall, most observers expect world growth in 2007 to be a little below last year's pace, but still above trend."

(RNS) — The Rev. Cecil Richards is working with members of his Kingstown Baptist Church to help feed people in St. Vincent who have been evacuated due to the volcanic eruption on the island nation. Soon after the initial eruption on Friday (April 9), volunteers prepared 170 meals from their church kitchen to distribute to evacuees at shelters in the southern part of the main island. The total meals increased to 250 by Monday and, he hopes, 300 soon. “That is only our immediate response,” he said of his church that is usually attended by 250 to 300 people in nonpandemic times. “That can’t be it.”"

Burns, with pressure from Nixon, supplied cheap money.There is no doubt in my mind that if the Fed continues to keep the lid on with regard to increases in money supply and if the economy does not expand,¡± Nixon wrote Burns, ¡°the blame will be put squarely on the Fed.¡± A Nixon aide bragged they ¡°had Arthur Burns by the balls.¡±Monthly money growth, which had averaged 3.2 percent in the first quarter of 1971, jumped to 11 percent in the same period of 1972.

valcano eruption,"Biggest volcanic explosion yet rocks Caribbean island of St. Vincent La Soufriere volcano fired an enormous amount of ash and hot gas early Monday in the biggest explosive eruption yet since volcanic activity began on the eastern Caribbean island of St. Vincent late last week, with officials worried about the lives of those who have refused to evacuate. Experts called it a “huge explosion” that generated pyroclastic flows down the volcano’s south and southwest flanks. “It’s destroying everything in its path,” Erouscilla Joseph, director of the University of the West Indies’ Seismic Research Center, told The Associated Press. “Anybody who would have not heeded the evacuation, they need to get out immediately.”"
wildfires,"A wildfire in northeastern Spain fanned by strong winds has left four people dead and more than 20 others injured.
Officials said two people - a 60-year-old French man and his 15-year-old daughter - jumped in the sea and died on Sunday while fleeing the flames near the town of Portbou near the French border.
The Catalan regional government said another 70-year-old French man died from a heart attack as he helped battle the fires near his home in the town of Llers.
The health department said a 64-year-old French national who suffered 80 percent burns on Sunday has since died of his injuries.
Several of the people injured were said to be in a serious condition.
The blaze broke out just after noon on Sunday near the town of La Jonquera close to the French border and has burnt out 12,000 hectares (30,000 acres) of land, the Catalan government said.
Regional government spokesman Felip Puig said on Sunday that train services in the region were suspended, and several roads linking Barcelona to France were closed because of the fires.
Spain has suffered its driest winter in 70 years, putting it at a higher risk than usual of forest fires this summer.
Earlier this month, a wildfire ravaged 50,000 hectares in the eastern Spanish region of Valencia."
other,"As announced in the ¡®Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies¡¯ of December 05, 2018, it was proposed that all new floating rate personal or retail loans (housing, auto, etc.) and floating rate loans to Micro and Small Enterprises extended by banks from April 1, 2019 shall be benchmarked to the external benchmarks, viz., the RBI Repo Rate or any other benchmark market interest rate published by the Financial Benchmark India Private Ltd. (FBIL).Taking into account the feedback received during discussions held with stakeholders on issues such as (i) management of interest rate risk by banks from fixed interest rate linked liabilities against floating interest rate linked assets and the related difficulties, and (ii) the lead time required for IT system upgradation, it has been decided to hold further consultations with stakeholders and work out an effective mechanism for transmission of rates.The framework on countercyclical capital buffer (CCCB) was put in place by the Reserve Bank in terms of guidelines issued on February 5, 2015 wherein it was advised that the CCCB would be activated as and when the circumstances warranted, and that the decision would normally be pre-announced. The framework envisages the credit-to-GDP gap as the main indicator, which may be used in conjunction with other supplementary indicators, viz., the Credit-Deposit (C-D) ratio for a moving period of three years (given its correlation with the credit-to-GDP gap and GNPA growth), industrial outlook (IO) assessment index (with due note of its correlation with GNPA growth), and interest coverage ratio (noting its correlation with the credit-to-GDP gap). Based on the review and empirical testing of CCCB indicators, it has been decided that it is not necessary to activate CCCB at this point in time."
other,"The new series on the IIP released by the CSO on May 12 improves the coverage of industrial activity, realigns weights and reclassifies sub-sectors to better capture the underlying structural dynamics of the sector, and smoothens the impact of lumpy items on the index. As a result, industrial production expanded by 5.0 per cent during 2016-17 based on the new series (as against 0.7 per cent in the old series). Turning to the current financial year, the output of eight core industries decelerated sharply in April on account of contraction in coal, crude oil and cement due to structural constraints and low demand. Furthermore, electricity generation decelerated due to depressed demand pricing out relatively expensive thermal output. By contrast, the production of steel and fertiliser picked up, the former driven up by exports and the latter by expectations of a normal monsoon.The business expectations index generated by the Reserve Bank¡¯s April round of the Industrial Outlook Survey reflects optimism in the manufacturing sector in Q2 of 2017-18, driven by expectations of rising rural demand, exports and profit margins. On the other hand, the manufacturing purchasing managers¡¯ index (PMI) moderated sequentially in May as employment contracted and new orders, both domestic and exports, slowed down. The index, however, remained in the expansion zone and the future output index accelerated for the third month in succession.High frequency real indicators of activity in the services sector point to a mixed performance in April. In the transportation sub-sector, freight carriage by air and rail gathered momentum, and passenger car sales accelerated on the back of sustained strength of urban demand. Sales of commercial vehicles and three-wheelers contracted, however, reflecting in part the effects of new emission norms and technology changes. Two-wheeler sales remained depressed, indicative of still subdued rural demand. In the communication sub-sector, there was a strong growth in the subscriber base of voice and data services. The sustained growth of foreign tourist arrivals and air passenger traffic, both domestic and international, supported activity in the hotels, restaurants and the hospitality sub-sector. Both steel consumption and cement production were, however, sluggish, pointing to continuing weakness in construction activity. The services PMI for May rose to its highest reading since November 2016, with an expansion in new business reflecting improving underlying demand conditions, alongside optimism on employme"
other,"Measured by year-on-year (y-o-y) changes in real GDP at market prices, aggregate demand strengthened to 7.7 per cent in Q4:2017-18 and surged to a nine-quarter high of 8.2 per cent in Q1:2018-19 (Table III.1). This extended its sequential acceleration to four successive quarters, beginning in Q2:2017-18. Momentum, measured by q-o-q seasonally adjusted annualised rate (SAAR), however, moderated in Q1:2018-19 (Chart III.1a).Among its components, consumption expanded on the back of growth in private final consumption expenditure (PFCE), which reached a six-quarter high of 8.6 per cent in Q1:2018-19. Government final consumption expenditure (GFCE) decelerated to 7.6 per cent, albeit from a high of 16.9 per cent in Q4:2017-18. Investment demand embodied in the growth of gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) decelerated sequentially in Q1:2018-19; however, it remained reasonably strong at 10 per cent, given the government¡¯s thrust on national highways and low-cost housing. Despite a hostile and unpredictable international trading environment, growth of exports of goods and services jumped to a 16-quarter high of 12.7 per cent in Q1:2018-19, mitigating the negative contribution of net exports to aggregate demand caused by the unrelenting surge in imports (Chart III.1b).The actual outcome for the quarter overshot the projection by 90 basis points, reflecting larger than expected gains in most of the constituents of aggregate demand. First, private consumption demand surprised on the upside in Q1:2018-19 and touched a six-quarter peak. The April 2018 projection had assumed that lingering effects of the goods and services tax (GST) implementation would have an adverse impact on consumption demand _ especially in urban areas _ through loss of output and employment in unorganised activities. Furthermore, a sharp acceleration in allied activities in the agricultural sector posted a growth of 8.1 per cent in Q1:2018-19, which was significantly above trend. This is likely to have boosted rural consumption. Second, GFCF growth overshot the projection on account of stronger than expected capital goods production and the robust recovery in the construction sector."
drought,"France experienced its driest July in more than 60 years, prompting the authorities to limit the use of water in more than two-thirds of the territory.
According to Météo France, from July 1 to July 28, average precipitation represented only 28 per cent of normal values ??across the country, making last month the driest July since 1959.
The southwest, Loire Valley and northeast were particularly affected by this significantly prolonged deficit of rains, known as a meteorological drought.
Prefectural decrees limiting the use of water have been issued in 73 of the country's 101 départements with 20 already experiencing crisis situations.
Hard-hit vegetation
As a consequence of this lack of rain, the country's soil is drier than usual, which is impairing the proper development of vegetation.
This agricultural drought ""must be watched"" in the northeastern region Grand Est, as well as in Auvergne-Rh?ne-Alpes, in Hauts-de-France and Lower Normandy, notes the country's meteorological agency.
This situation (drought, high temperature) also favours the development of wildfires.
Dry riverbeds
The largest French river, the Loire, is currently experiencing a sharp drop in its flow. The prefecture of the department of Maine-et-Loire, for example, has put in place many restrictions due to the situation.
Waterways have even completely disappeared in the northeast of the country, like the Doubs which is completely dry with the riverbed transformed into grazing ground for cattle.
This phenomenon had already been observed two years ago when this river had been completely dry for more than six months."
other,"Barring a significant shock in the external environment, the Singapore economy should expand at a moderate pace over the course of the year.  Wage pressures will persist and firms are likely to pass on business costs to consumer prices.  Consequently, MAS Core Inflation is expected to stay elevated.MAS will therefore maintain its policy of a modest and gradual appreciation of the S$NEER policy band.  There will be no change to the slope of the policy band, and the level at which it is centred.  The width of the band will be kept unchanged.  The policy stance is assessed to be appropriate for containing domestic and imported sources of inflation, and ensuring medium-term price stability as a basis for sustainable growth.  MAS will continue to be vigilant over developments in the external environment, including in financial markets, and stands ready to curb excessive volatility in the S$NEER. "
earthquake,"Earthquake off Russia's Kuril Islands prompts tsunami warning A magnitude 7.5 earthquake has hit off the coast of the Kuril Islands, in eastern Russia. The US Geological Survey has warned the event could ""generate a destructive tsunami"" in the North Pacific. According to the United States Geological Survey the earthquake hit a depth of 59 kilometres (37 miles), around 1,400 kilometres (around 850 miles) northeast of the Japanese city of Sapporo. ""This earthquake has the potential to generate a destructive tsunami in the source region,"" the US Tsunami Warning Center said, adding that it was ""analyzing the event to determine the level of danger""."
Typhoon,"Typhoon Utor powered ashore on the northern Philippine Island of Luzon on Monday near 3 am local time (3 pm EDT Sunday) as a Category 4 storm with 140 mph winds. Damage was heavy in Casiguran (population 24,000) near where the typhoon made landfall, with 80% of the infrastructure of the town reportedly destroyed, and all roads into the city blocked. Utor is being blamed for two deaths so far, and 44 fishermen are reported as missing.
Passage over Luzon disrupted the inner core of Utor, reducing the storm to Category 2 strength with winds of 100 mph. Satellite imagery shows that the typhoon is re-organizing, and a new eyewall is forming. Ocean temperatures are very warm, about 30°C (86°F), which is approximately 0.5 - 1.0°C above average. These warm waters extend to tremendous depth, giving Utor a huge source of energy to tap into. Wind shear is low, 5 - 10 knots. These favorable conditions for intensification will last until the typhoon gets midway between the Philippines and China, where wind shear will rise to the moderate range and ocean waters will cool to 29°C with a much lower heat content. I expect Utor will intensify into a Category 3 storm today, and make landfall in China as a Category 2 or 3 storm about 200 hundred miles southwest of Hong Kong about 06 UTC on Wednesday. Utor is a very wet storm, and will likely bring a large swath of 8+ inches of rain across Southeast China on Wednesday. These rains will cause dangerous flash flooding and mudslides.
Utor is a Marshallese word for squall line, and has been used for three tropical cyclones in the Western Pacific--in 2001, 2006, and 2013. Utor reached super typhoon status with 150 mph winds on Sunday, making it the strongest tropical cyclone globally so far in 2013. Earth's previous most powerful tropical cyclone of 2013 was Typhoon Soulik, which reached Category 4 strength with 145 mph winds on July 10. Soulik weakened to a Category 2 storm before hitting Taiwan on July 12."
earthquake,"An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.1 centered under the Talkeetna Mountains in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough shook Southcentral Alaska on Sunday evening.
The quake hit just before 11 p.m. and was centered about 60 miles east of Talkeetna and around 100 miles northeast of Anchorage, according to the Alaska Earthquake Center. It was centered at a depth of about 27 miles. the center reported.
The USGS initially reported the preliminary magnitude as 6.0 and later adjusted the magnitude to 6.1 after review.
The earthquake was felt from Homer to Fairbanks, and was especially strong in the Mat-Su and Anchorage areas. ADN readers on Facebook described items falling off shelves, and many described an extended rolling motion with a sharp jolt midway.
“Talkeetna ... long rumble followed by a very strong jolt that flexed the house and sent some stuff on shelves to the floor,” wrote Mark Westman of Talkeetna. “Then more rumbling. It was a long one. No damage, but the big jolt in the middle definitely rattled the nerves, that one packed a punch.” He later added in a message, “It was notable for the duration as well as the big jolt in the middle.”"
wildfires,"The Caldor Fire in Northern California prompted thousands more to evacuate after it swelled more than 10 times its size in the past two days.
The wildfire, which ignited Saturday evening in El Dorado County, about 60 miles east of Sacramento, exploded from 6,500 acres Tuesday morning to 65,474 acres Thursday morning, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire. The fire has already left two people seriously injured and was zero percent contained.
""The unfortunate thing is that these fires continue to get bigger,"" Cal Fire Director Thom Porter said during a Wednesday press conference. ""But we're surging resources into communities to protect and reduce the impact.”
Fueled by dry conditions, Cal Fire said the fire continued to spread and ""make runs in several steep drainages,"" making it more difficult for fire officials to accurately map the incident. Dozens of firefighters also faced dynamic conditions on the ground, including smoke from the nearby Dixie Fire, which has hampered air attacks.
The rapid growth of the Caldor Fire has forced 23,000 people to flee in El Dorado County as of Wednesday night, up from 6,850 on Tuesday, according to the California Governor's Office of Emergency Service. Evacuation warnings were issued for parts of Amador County, too.
A total of more than 36,000 people across multiple counties in California have been forced to evacuate as active wildfires continue to ravage the state.
Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for El Dorado County early Tuesday, mobilizing the California National Guard and freeing up additional resources for impacted communities.
Two people were flown to hospitals with serious injuries and very few homes were left standing in El Dorado County's Grizzly Flats. Streets in the town of about 1,200 residents were littered with downed power lines and poles. Houses were reduced to smoldering ash and twisted metal with only chimneys rising above the ruins. A post office and elementary school were also destroyed.
On Tuesday, the neighborhoods of Pollock Pines, Sly Park, Happy Valley and the Grizzly Flats and Somerset areas were all issued mandatory evacuation orders while campers were rushed out of the Sly Park Recreation Area. Dark heavy smoke blanketed much of the area encircling the Caldor Fire, including nearby Lake Tahoe and other population destinations, prompting bumper-to-bumper traffic along evacuation routes."
drought,"Chile has been hit by its worst drought in six decades, forcing officials to declare an agricultural emergency to prevent the collapse of farming. 
The country's capital Santiago and its outskirts, as well as Coquimbo, Valparaiso and O'Higgins, are among the worst-hit areas.
The emergency status, impacting almost half the country, will see relief measures fast-tracked for the agriculture industry, including drinking water and medicine for animals.
In some areas, water for human consumption has become scarce.
Cattle are collapsing where they stand and reducing to skeletons in the baking heat, and boats have been left abandoned in dried-out marinas.
""We are talking about a process of desertification rather than a temporary drought or absence of rain problem. We are talking about a tendency that has come to stay,"" Felipe Machado, director of the country's resilience institute.
This year has been one of the driest years Chile has experienced in sixty years, according to agriculture minister Antonio Walker."
other,"Activity in the services sector appears to be improving as the constraining effects of demonetisation wear off. On the one hand, rural demand remains depressed as reflected in lower sales of two- and three-wheelers and fertiliser. On the other hand, high frequency indicators relating to railway traffic, telephone subscribers, foreign tourist arrivals, passenger car and commercial vehicles are regaining pace, thereby positioning the services sector on a rising trajectory. After three consecutive months of contraction, the services PMI for February and March emerged into the expansion zone on improvement in new business.After moderating continuously over the last six months to a historic low, retail inflation measured by year-on-year changes in the consumer price index (CPI) turned up in February to 3.7 per cent. While food prices bottomed out at the preceding month¡¯s level, base effects pushed up inflation in this category. Prices of sugar, fruits, meat, fish, milk and processed foods increased, generating a sizable jump in the momentum in the food group. In the fuel group, inflation increased as the continuous hardening of international prices lifted domestic prices of liquefied petroleum gas during December 2016 _ February 2017. Kerosene prices have also been increasing since July with the programmed reduction of the subsidy. Adapting to the movements in these salient prices, both three months ahead and a year ahead households¡¯ inflation expectations, which had dipped in the December round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s survey, reversed in the latest round. Moreover, the survey reveals hardening of price expectations across product groups. The 77th round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s industrial outlook survey indicates that pricing power is returning to corporates as profit margins get squeezed by input costs.Excluding food and fuel, inflation moderated in February by 20 basis points to 4.8 per cent, essentially on transient and item-specific factors. In February, favourable base effects were at work in the clothing and bedding sub-group as well as in personal care and effects, the latter also influenced by the disinflation in gold prices. The volatility in crude oil prices and its lagged pass-through are impacting the trajectory of CPI inflation excluding food and fuel. Much of the impact of the fall of US $4.5 per barrel in international prices of crude since early February would feed into the CPI print in April as its cumulative pass-through occurred with a lag in the first week of this month. Importantly, inflation excluding food and fuel has exhibited persistence and has been significantly above headline inflation since September 2016."
other,"Global trade growth has continued to strengthen, though geo-political tensions have contributed recently to declining export orders and air freight. Crude oil prices rose sharply till May 24 on heightened geo-political tensions, but moderated thereafter on expectations of easing of supplies by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia. Base metal prices, especially aluminium, have risen on account of US sanctions on Russia. Gold has witnessed selling pressure on a stronger dollar, but the metal gained last week on political uncertainty in the Euro Area. Inflation pressures have emerged in some key advanced and emerging economies, driven in part by rising commodity prices.Financial markets have been driven mainly by monetary policy expectations and geo-political developments. Equity market performance has varied across regions with modest gains in the AEs on strong Q1 earnings and abating of trade tensions, while stocks in major EMEs have faced sell offs on a rising dollar and expectations of further rate hikes by the Fed. The 10-year sovereign yield in the US crossed 3 per cent in mid-May on strong economic data as well as expectations of tighter monetary policy and fiscal expansion, but softened subsequently on safe haven demand; yields softened in other key AEs as well. In most EMEs, however, bond yields have risen on reduced foreign appetite for their debt due to growing dollar shortage in the global market and on prospects of higher interest rates in AEs. In currency markets, the US dollar touched its highest level in May since December 2017. The euro depreciated significantly against the dollar reflecting a combination of factors, including soft growth data for the Euro Area, which suggested that monetary policy normalisation by the European Central Bank could be delayed, and political uncertainty in its southern periphery. EME currencies have, by and large, depreciated against the US dollar."

On 1 February, Myanmar's military seized power from its civilian government, leading to a series of mass protests that show no signs of stopping.
Among the protesters were thousands of healthcare workers who walked out, leading to a collapse in the healthcare system and throwing Myanmar's vaccination and testing response into chaos.
And now, a surge in coronavirus cases fuelled by the highly infectious Delta variant has dealt the country a fresh blow.
People are lining up outside of oxygen factories in the hope of buying or refilling cylinders, despite a government ban on direct oxygen sales to the public. Crematoriums are overflowing with bodies.

wildfires,"The province is escalating the fight against an out-of-control wildfire threatening Zama City in northwest Alberta.
""We do have a Type 1 team mobilizing to the site,"" said Heather Hawkins with Sustainable Resource Development. ""They are the most experienced and most well trained fire managers.""
The fire is estimated at more than 100,000 hectares, but heavy smoke makes it difficult to be more precise, she said.
Firefighters are holding a fire about 10 kilometres from the oil and gas hamlet of Zama City, about 930 kilometres northwest of Edmonton.
About 130 people were evacuated from their homes to hotels and a school in High Level, Alta., late Tuesday night when winds picked up and began pushing the fire south towards the hamlet.
""The high pressure ridge that was sitting over northern Alberta started to break down which means we had some strong winds start to pick up,"" said SRD spokesperson Rob Harris. ""That's what really fanned the fires.""
SRD recommended the hamlet evacuate immediately and Mackenzie County agreed to issue a mandatory evacuation order, he said.
Zama resident Janet Hackett said she got a sense around 4 p.m. Tuesday that people would have to leave. The family had their bags packed and ready to go when the evacuation order was issued.
""The town was becoming really, really smoky, and the skies were really red and grey, so we knew that it was getting pretty intense,"" she said.
The family then drove along a dirt road for two hours to reach High Level.
Hackett's husband, Richard, is Zama's fire chief. He returned to the hamlet Wednesday morning."
other,"The rule of thumb for monetary policymakers has long been that if inflation is below official target ranges, short-term interest rates should be set at a level that spurs spending and investment. This approach has meant that once interest rates reach or approach zero, central banks have little choice but to activate large asset-purchase programs that are supposed to stimulate demand. When circumstances call for it, policymakers default to the predetermined scripts of neo-Keynesian economic models.But in too many cases, those scripts have led us astray, because they assume that monetary policy has a measurable and foreseeable impact on demand and inflation. There is plenty of reason to question this assumption.For starters, households have not responded to ultra-low interest rates by saving less and spending more. If savings no longer yield a return, people can¡¯t afford big-ticket items or pay for retirement down the road. Likewise, companies today are faced with so much uncertainty and so many risks that ever-lower costs of capital have not enticed them to invest more.It¡¯s easy to see why, despite the data, predetermined formulas are attractive to monetary policymakers. The prevailing wisdom holds that in order to return the inflation rate to a preferred level, any slack in the economy must be eliminated. This requires pushing interest rates as low as possible, and when these policies have run their course (such as when rates dip toward the negative), unconventional instruments like ¡°quantitative easing¡± must be deployed to revive growth and inflation. The paradigm has become so universally accepted _ and the model simulations underpinning central banks¡¯ decisions have become so complex _ that few are willing to question it. For individual central banks or economists, to do so would be sacrilege."

Hundreds more were injured when the earthquake struck in the early hours, triggering panic among the terrified residents of the island.  So far, 34 bodies have been hauled from beneath crumpled buildings in Mamuju, a city of about 110,000 in West Sulawesi province, while another eight were killed south of the area after the quake struck.

other,"Since April 2004, MAS has maintained the policy of a modest and gradual appreciation of the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER) policy band.  In October 2007, the policy was tightened through a slight increase in the slope of the band.  The gradual appreciation of the S$ exchange rate over the past few years has helped to mitigate inflationary pressures. Since the last policy review, the S$NEER has fluctuated in the upper half of the policy band.  (Chart 1)  This occurred against the general weakness of the US$ and the concomitant strengthening of other currencies including the yen and euro.  Amidst the cuts in US interest rates by the Federal Reserve, the domestic three-month interbank interest rate fell from 2.75% as at end-August 2007 to 1.31% at the end of March 2008."

In the Philippines, the clean-up operations have started with emergency services and residents working to restore electricity and resume normal life in the capital Manila.
On Tuesday, the mighty storm slammed Manila and the main island of Luzon, unleashing floodwaters and fierce winds of up to 150km/h. According to the BBC, most deaths occurred in and around the capital.
Another 35 people are unaccounted for, said the Philippine disaster agency. About 108 people were rescued from the floodwaters as residents and local authorities responded quickly _ forcing evacuations of low-lying areas and setting up temporary shelters in safer grounds."
Typhoon,"An island south of Tokyo, Izu Oshima, was worst hit by Typhoon Wipha, suffering landslides and flooding.
Many people died when houses collapsed or were buried in mudslides. At least 50 people remain unaccounted for.
Work to protect the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant was carried out but the operators say it appears to have escaped the worst of the storm.
In Tokyo, flights were cancelled, bullet train services suspended and schools closed.
""It is the strongest typhoon in 10 years to pass the Kanto [Tokyo area] region,"" Hiroyuki Uchida, the Japan Meteorological Agency's chief forecaster, told journalists on Tuesday.
Typhoon Wipha has now been downgraded to a tropical storm as it moves north-east.
The storm brought strong winds and record rainfall on Wednesday morning.
Nearly 5 inches (12cm) of rainfall fell in just one hour on Izu Oshima island, some 120km (75 miles) south of Tokyo.
The storm sent large volumes of earth down mountainsides and caused rivers to burst their banks.
Television footage showed the remains of wooden homes buried in mud and covered in debris.
""I heard a crackling sound and then the trees on the hillside all fell over,"" a woman on the island told national broadcaster NHK television. ""Then mud slid as far as the house.""
Japanese media said the death toll had risen to 16 but 51 people remained unaccounted for on Izu Oshima.
Rescuers were struggling to access many areas, local reports said.
""City hall and fire officials are doing rescue work in places that are accessible,"" a local official told AFP news agency.
Extra police officers and soldiers as well as helicopters have been sent to the island - a popular tourist destination with more than 8,000 residents - to help with the rescue effort.
In Tokyo, a woman died after falling in a river and a search was under way for two young boys last seen on a beach, reports said.
About 400 domestic and international flights were also cancelled in the capital, Kyodo news agency said.
Nearly 20,000 people were ordered to leave and thousands of schools shut as a result of the typhoon, Reuters news agency reported.
Around midday (03:00 GMT), the typhoon passed close to Fukushima, where contaminated water used to cool reactor cores is being stored in temporary tanks.
Plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Company said it had to pump out rain water from around the storage tanks, but added that its radiation readings were within a safe limit.
The storm had caused the plant no new problems, a spokesman said."
other,"The Australian economy has performed strongly in the recent period, with favourable outcomes being recorded on several fronts. Output growth has picked up and this has been accompanied by continued strength in incomes and falling unemployment. At the same time, despite high levels of capacity utilisation and tight labour market conditions, there has been some moderation in underlying inflation.These developments have taken place against a background of continued strength in the global economy. Most expectations are that growth of the world economy this year will again be above average, though a little below last year's pace. The US economy is now in a period of more moderate growth, with activity being dampened by a downturn in the housing sector. There remain uncertainties over the US outlook, particularly relating to developments in the sub-prime mortgage market, but the indications to date are that the spillover from the housing downturn has been limited. In other parts of the world, conditions have generally remained strong. China's rapid growth has continued, with the pace increasing further in the March quarter. The euro area is now recording its fastest growth for some time and the Japanese expansion is proceeding at a good pace, though growth in other parts of east Asia seems to have eased recently."
wildfires,"Alaskan fire crews are fighting two tundra fires sparked by lightning in the southwest of the state, which has experienced a warm winter with little snow, according to AP.
By Monday the fires had covered 63 square miles of the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge, the AP report said, but weekend rain helped quell the spread. The fires are burning in a biologically diverse area, home to nesting waterfowl and a variety of plant species.
“There’s lots of vegetation,” Fish and Wildlife Service fire ecologist Lisa Saperstein said. “And where you have vegetation, it’s fuel.”
Tundra fires are sometimes allowed to burn out on their own if they don’t threaten infrastructure. In this case, fire information spokesman Tim Mowry said, crews weren’t sent to fight one of the fires until it grew to almost 20 square miles in size. As of Monday, the fires remained about 50 miles away from the town of Bethel, AP reported.
Saperstein said that tundra fires are rarer than forest fires in southwest Alaska, but do still occur.
Areas with less snow have less moisture in the ground, putting them at greater risk of fire. A 2013 report by the University of Alaska Fairbanks Cooperative Extension Service states that Alaska may see a growth in tundra fires in the coming century due to climate change."
drought,"The severe drought in North Island, New Zealand-- the worst in 50 years in some areas-- has prompted the Auckland Council's Emergency Committee to introduce mandatory water restrictions, which will be effective across the region beginning May 16, 2020.
This year's dry spell has hit hard and wide, according to the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) meteorologist, Ben Noll. NIWA's figures show that the areas of Whangarei, Whitianga, Hamilton, Tauranga, Whakatane, Napier, Taupo, and Auckland have had their driest January to April on record.
In response to the worsening drought, the Auckland Council's Emergency Committee voted unanimously on Thursday, May 7, to introduce mandatory water restrictions to take effect across the region next week.
""We really need Aucklanders to come together and reduce the amount of water we are using. As a city, we have done a good job to date, but given we have only had 36 percent of our usual rainfall we need to do more,"" said mayor Phil Goff.
""The last month has shown that if we put our mind to it, we can make the changes we need to help our city and that is what I am asking for of Aucklanders now with these water restrictions.""
He continued, ""The first stage of restrictions will ban the use of outdoor hoses and water-blasters. It will also prohibit the watering of sports fields, plants, or paddocks unless an irrigation system is fitted with soil moisture or rain sensors, and require car washes to operate only if they use recyclable water.""
Goff reminded Auckland citizens that if they don't save water, the council will have to implement stricter restrictions in the future.
""I hope Aucklanders will understand the need to adhere to these measures, but if we have to, we have a range of enforcement options available for those who choose to ignore the restrictions.”
The proposed restrictions cover outdoor water use as it can be observed, but none of the three stages impose restrictions on drinking water or sanitary use of water in households, as well as operations that use water for emergency, health, and biosecurity measures."
other,"In the March 2018 round of the Reserve Bank¡¯s survey, professional forecasters expected real gross domestic product (GDP) growth to pick up marginally from 7.2 per cent in Q3:2017-18 to 7.3 per cent in Q1:2018-19 and remain at 7.2 per cent in Q2-Q4 (Chart I.9 and Table I.4).Taking into account the baseline assumptions, survey indicators and model forecasts, real GDP growth is projected to improve from 6.6 per cent in 2017-18 to 7.4 per cent in 2018-19 _ 7.3 per cent in Q1, 7.4 per cent in Q2, 7.3 per cent in Q3 and 7.6 per cent in Q4 _ with risks evenly balanced around this baseline path.5 For 2019-20, the structural model estimates indicate real GDP growth at 7.7 per cent, with quarterly growth rates in the range of 7.4-7.9 per cent, assuming a normal monsoon, and no major exogenous/policy shocks (Chart I.10).Risks to the baseline growth scenario need to be monitored carefully. First, the uncertainty associated with the pace and timing of normalisation of monetary policy in the US and other major AE central banks has led to recurrent bouts of volatility in international financial markets which may have an adverse impact on capital flows and overall investment sentiment, including for EMEs through the ¡°finance¡± channel. Second, protectionist measures in the US and the generalised threat of a trade war can exacerbate volatility in global financial markets, with spillovers to domestic financial markets and adverse implications for the growth outlook. Large revisions in past data on national accounts statistics also pose a challenge to forecasts (Box I.1)."
wildfires,"The wildfire in northern Alberta charred more than 500,000 hectares of land, six times the size of New York City, since it hit Fort McMurray in early May.
It forced widespread evacuations and triggered a prolonged energy shutdown that has cut Canadian oil output by a million barrels a day.
The fire's footprint now exceeds the total area burned during Alberta's entire 2015 fire season, and flames spread on Thursday into the neighbouring province of Saskatchewan, though no evacuations were ordered there so far.
Cooler weather with light rain significantly helped firefighters and air quality over the past two days, provincial authorities said.
""Firefighters continue to dig in and hold the line around the community and protect critical infrastructure,"" Alberta Wildfire manager Chad Morrison told reporters.
""We'll have good firefighting days ahead.""
Mr Morrison said 1,000 fresh firefighters would be brought to the area over the next two weeks, making a total of about 2,100 personnel backed by bulldozers and aircraft dumping flame retardant.
The weather offered a glimmer of hope for crude operations, with Statoil saying on Friday that production had increased at its Leismer project.
Other companies said they had restarted limited operations or were ""cautiously optimistic"" of doing so soon.
Still, many operations remain shut due to the blaze, which comes on the back of a two-year slump in global crude prices."

This resulted in widespread flooding and landslides in multiple provinces of Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam.  Severe Tropical Storm SAUDEL is forecasted to hit Central Viet Nam on 25 October 2020. This will be the third tropical cyclone to impact the central provinces within three consecutive weeks.

Typhoon,"As per forecasts discussed in our blog last week, Cyclone Phailin struck the east coast of India over the weekend with winds estimated at near 130 mph.
It brought a strong storm surge along the coast and more than 230 mm (9 inches) of rain was recorded as the cyclone passed.
The cyclone was of a similar strength to one which struck just a little further up the coast in 1999, which claimed more than 10,000 lives.
Excellent forecasts for Phailin, combined with well executed warning and evacuation procedures, meant the loss of life was much less this time around.
Phailin became a tropical storm a little more than three days before landfall, but computer models were able to give far greater warning than this.
Medium range prediction models suggested a higher risk of cyclone formation in the Bay of Bengal a full nine days before Cyclone Phailin struck.
At six days ahead, shorter range models were predicting that the north-eastern coast of India could be under threat, although the timing was not certain at that stage.
Four days ahead, computer models were able to pinpoint the location and timing of landfall to a high degree of accuracy _ all before the storm was strong enough to be named.
Cyclone Phailin originated from a disturbance in the far west Pacific basin and was one of a series of tropical storms seen in this region recently."
drought,"More anthills than blades of grass are visible in some of the cracked earth around Junction. The year-long drought has plagued the town — as it has the rest of the state — and for a painful, six-week stretch, Junction banned all outdoor watering.
Some 4.5 inches of rain earlier this month increased the flow of the Llano River, two forks of which meet at the town. But the water is still pretty low — and four panelists at the Texas Water Symposium last week brought some unwelcome news to the townspeople: It’s not going to get any better anytime soon.
“As the state climatologist, people ask me, ‘When’s it going to rain?’” said John Nielsen-Gammon, one of the panelists, who is a professor of meteorology at Texas A&M University and the state's climatologist.
The answer, according to Nielsen-Gammon, is “eventually,” but chances are the drought will last another year, possibly even another decade.
The weather, or lack thereof, can be attributed to La Nia, a cyclical weather pattern resulting in cooler waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Meteorologists say that although La Nia had faded by the summer, it has now returned and is strengthening.
In the past 12 months, Texas has seen 11.1 inches of rainfall on average, according to Nielsen-Gammon, and it broke a heat record for the country that was previously set during the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. Texas AgriLife Extension Service estimates the cost of the drought to be about 5.2 billion, and that estimate — already out of date because it was compiled two months ago — doesn’t include the impact to several kinds of crops and the forestry industry.
Junction, known as the land of living waters, has seen some of its streams dry up. In August, town officials say, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality told Junction to cease outdoor water use of any kind when the town of Llano downstream reported it was close to running out of water."
other,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi again urged members of Congress to not visit Afghanistan or neighboring countries after at least 12 US service members and dozens of civilians were killed on Thursday, noting that the Departments of Defense and State have ""explicitly stated"" that such trips would ""unnecessarily divert needed resources"" from evacuating Americans and Afghan allies.
""It should be clear that any Member presence presents a danger and an opportunity cost of resources, regardless of whatever value that Members consider they may add by such trips,"" the California Democrat said in a letter to lawmakers.
Pelosi's letter came a few days after Michigan Republican Rep. Peter Meijer and Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton went on an unauthorized trip to Kabul's airport, where they said they wanted to conduct oversight of the evacuation.
Their colleagues and the Biden administration criticized the effort as dangerous and a strain on the military as it feverishly works to comply by the administration's August 31 deadline for the US to complete its withdrawal.
Pelosi said in her letter Thursday that more than 100,000 people have been evacuated from Afghanistan since the end of July and that Congress ""must and will continue to be briefed"" by the administration about its efforts. She added that she and other congressional leaders were briefed by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Thursday and that Congress ""remains deeply concerned about the security and humanitarian situation."""
other,"The second advance estimates for 2020-21 released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on February 26, 2021 placed India¡¯s real gross domestic product (GDP) contraction at 8.0 per cent during the year. High frequency indicators _ vehicle sales; railway freight traffic; toll collections; goods and services tax (GST) revenues; e-way bills; and steel consumption _ suggest that gains in manufacturing and services activity in Q3:2020-21 extended into Q4. Purchasing managers¡¯ index (PMI) manufacturing at 55.4 in March 2021 remained in expansion zone, but lower than its level in February. The index of industrial production slipped into marginal contraction in January 2021, dragged down by manufacturing and mining. Core industries also contracted in February. The resilience of agriculture is evident from foodgrains and horticulture production for 2020-21, which are expected to be 2.0 per cent and 1.8 per cent higher respectively than the final estimates of 2019-20.Headline inflation increased to 5.0 per cent in February after having eased to 4.1 per cent in January 2021. Within an overall food inflation print of 4.3 per cent in February, five out of twelve food sub-groups recorded double digit inflation. While fuel inflation pressures eased somewhat in February, core inflation registered a generalised hardening and increased by 50 basis points to touch 6 per cent.System liquidity remained in large surplus in February and March 2021 with average daily net liquidity absorption of _5.9 lakh crore.

Typhoon,"Tropical storm Cristobal a possible landfall threat to Gulf coast Tropical storm Cristobal has formed in the Bay of Campeche as the third named storm of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season. Cristobal is forecast to head into the Gulf of Mexico, with a course towards the United States Gulf Coast and a landfall as a strengthening tropical storm, or perhaps even as hurricane Cristobal, now seen as a possibility. Updated 07:00 BTS Jun 3rd: Tropical storm Cristobal has formed out of a low pressure remnant that formed after a Pacific tropical storm named Amanda crossed over Central American country of Guatemala and crossed Mexico. Once the low pressure remnant emerged over the Bay of Campeche it became a tropical depression and then was soon upgraded to tropical storm Cristobal. Tropical storm Cristobal is currently packing 60 mph sustained winds and higher gusts, with minimum central pressure of 994 mb. Having spent recent hours circling close to the Mexican coastline, Cristobal has shifted southeast and is likely to make landfall crossing the southern Bay of Campeche coast later today. After a time inland, the forecast models show Cristobal moving back north and emerging back over the Bay of Campeche around Thursday night and into Friday. Forecast models then show Cristobal moving steadily north across the Gulf, which does mean it could be the first landfall threat to insurance and reinsurance market interests of the 2020 Atlantic storm season. The storm is now forecast to head slowly out into the Gulf of Mexico after meandering for a time near the shore, with strengthening likely and many forecast models are showing storm Cristobal heading towards the U.S. Gulf Coast and strengthening, with a slim chance currently of reaching hurricane status before its arrival. The immediate threat is severe rainfall to Mexico, with totals of 10 to 20 inches and isolated maximum amounts of 25 inches expected over parts of the Mexican states of Tabasco and Campeche. More broadly, 10 to 15 inches of rain is expected over parts of the Mexican states of Chiapas, Veracruz, Quintana Roo, Yucatan and Oaxaca, while rainfall of 10 to 15 inches, with isolated amounts of 25 inches, is expected along the Pacific coasts of Chiapas, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Some of these Pacific areas have already experienced up to 20 inches of rain, so ground is sodden and there is a risk of life-threatening flash floods and mudslides. After tropical storm Cristobal emerges back into the Gulf there remains significant uncertainty over how well organised it will be and whether it will make it to the U.S., the probability appears to have declined overnight. Many forecast models continue to point towards a more central Gulf Coast landfall scenario, but there is still significant uncertainty and range in the forecast path for Cristobal, as well as in terms of potential intensity. You can view a recent forecast model run showing the intensity guidance for tropical storm Cristobal below, sourced from TropicalTidbits.com."
flood,"US aids central Vietnam $100,000 to cope with floods The U.S. will provide Vietnam $100,000 in response to Storm Linfa battering the central coast, its ambassador to the country announced. These funds will be provided by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to Vietnam Red Cross Society (VNRC) to address the immediate humanitarian needs of vulnerable communities in areas most affected by tropical storm Linfa, Ambassador Daniel J. Kritenbrink said Saturday.  Storm Linfa is the sixth tropical storm to hit Vietnam in 2020 and made landfall on October 11.  Prior to Storm Linfa, the central region had already suffered days of severe flooding, resulting from a combination of a cold spell moving down from the north and an intertropical convergence zone stretching from the Indian Ocean to the Philippines.  The region got no respite from rains and floods as storm Nangka hit on Wednesday, followed by a tropical depression Friday night.  As of Saturday, flooding had adversely affected over 136,000 households - resulting in at least 60 deaths. These include two people killed when a landslide buried a group of workers at a hydropower plant in Thua Thien Hue Province and 13 others killed by another landslide while attempting to rescue the victims. 15 workers hit by the first landslide are still missing."
Typhoon,"Six tourists, including two young children, have been killed in a freak storm in Greece.
Trees and pylons were ripped up, vehicles overturned and a sea of debris strewn everywhere as the storm tore through the northern Halkidiki peninsula on Wednesday night.
A total of seven people were killed and about 140 more were injured, although most of them not seriously, police said.
Two elderly Czech tourists died after high winds overturned their vehicle, while an eight-year-old boy and his mother from Romania were killed when an outdoor restaurant’s lean-to roof collapsed.
A man and a young boy, both Russians, also died when a tree fell near their hotel.
A body found at sea was identified as that of a missing fisherman.
The 62-year-old’s body was located by an air force helicopter 6.8 nautical miles off the coast.
Government spokesman Stelios Petsas said 23 people remained in hospital on Thursday, including one woman who was in a critical condition in intensive care.
A state of emergency was declared in the region, a three-finger peninsula near the northern city of Thessaloniki popular with tourists in the summer."
other,"Since the third bi-monthly statement of August 2015, global growth has moderated, especially in emerging market economies (EMEs), global trade has deteriorated further and downside risks to growth have increased. In the United States, industrial production slowed as capital spending in the energy sector was cut back and exports contracted, weighed down by the strength of the US dollar. Consumer spending stayed buoyant, however, amidst steadily improving labour market conditions. In the Euro area, a fragile recovery strengthened, supported by domestic consumption, less slack in the labour market and improving financial conditions engendered by ultra-accommodative monetary policy. Economic activity in Japan, however, is faltering under the weight of weak private consumption and exports, with both business and consumer confidence subdued. EMEs are caught in a vortex of slowing global trade volumes, depressed commodity prices, weakening currencies and capital outflows, which is accentuating country-specific domestic constraints. China¡¯s intended rebalancing from investment towards consumption is being hit by the stock market meltdown, slower industrial production and weaker exports. The devaluation of the renminbi on August 11, while mild, has unsettled financial markets across the world. Brazil and Russia are grappling with recession and runaway inflation, while South Africa is facing tightening structural constraints which threaten to tip it into a downturn.Since the Chinese devaluation, equity prices, commodities and currencies have fallen sharply. Capital flight from EMEs into mature bond markets has pushed down developed market yields, and risk spreads across asset classes have widened. Although volatility ebbed in early September and capital flows returned cautiously to some EMEs, sentiment in financial markets remains fragile. The September 17 decision of the Federal Open Market Committee to stay on hold in response to global conditions and weak domestic inflation lifted financial markets briefly, but overall financial conditions are yet to stabilise."
other,"In October last year, MAS increased slightly the slope of the S$NEER policy band, with no change to the level at which the band was centred.  This policy decision was made in light of upside risks to inflation amidst sustained high levels of domestic economic activity.  At the same time, the policy band was widened slightly to accommodate volatility across international financial markets.Since then, the S$NEER (Chart 1) has appreciated gradually within the upper half of the policy band.  This took place in the context of a general strengthening in regional currencies given broad-based weakness in the US$ and continued investor interest in higher-growth Asian and emerging markets.  Amidst conditions of abundant global liquidity, the domestic three-month interbank rate has eased further since end-October last year to 0.44%."

The earthquake was initially recorded at magnitude 6 at a depth of 10 km (6.2 miles), the GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences earlier said.
The Philippines Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Philvolcs) said it recorded the depth at 15 km, adding that the earthquake was tectonic.
The Southeast Asian country is on the geologically active Pacific Ring of Fire and experiences frequent earthquakes, particularly in the south."
other,"The Fed responded rapidly and dramatically to keep the U.S. economy from descending into depression. Monetary policymakers reduced the benchmark fed funds rate to near zero; promised to more than double the size of the Fed's balance sheet by engaging in large-scale asset purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, with the intent of reducing longer-run interest rates; and restarted or created a number of special purpose vehicles (SPVs), which are off the Fed's balance sheet, to stabilize a broad array of financial markets.[1] The U.S. Treasury has worked closely with the Fed to backstop lending and increase leverage, providing $454 billion to cover potential losses from the Fed's lending programs to private firms under the CARES Act (an acronym for Coronavirus, Aid, Relief, and Economic Security). With leverage estimated at 10 to 1, the Fed may lend as much as $4.54 trillion¡ªnone of which would show up as part of the federal deficit (see Ip and Torres).By monetizing much of the new federal debt and engaging in credit allocation, the Fed risks sacrificing monetary control and its independence. Of course, the Board of Governors could increase the rate of interest it pays on excess reserves to keep inflation at bay. However, in so doing, it would deprive the Treasury of revenue to help reduce budget deficits.The more serious issue for the Fed's credibility and independence is the drift into fiscal space. As Charles Plosser, former CEO and president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia has warned: ""Independence is drifting away and after this [Covid-19] crisis it will be easier and easier for politicians to seek Fed participation in off-budget fiscal actions.""[2]The Fed's decision to set up SPVs to purchase corporate and municipal debt opens the door for all sorts of mischief (see Timiraos). Likewise, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) now accepts more risky assets, including commercial mortgage securities and collateralized loan obligations. As such, the Fed will be buying ""the worst shopping malls in the country and some of the most indebted companies."" Consequently, ""the opportunities for losses will be that much greater,"" according to an editorial in the Wall Street Journal."
other,"The Congress established the Federal Reserve, set its monetary policy objectives, and provided it with operational independence to pursue those objectives. The Federal Reserve's operational independence is critical, as it allows the FOMC to make monetary policy decisions based solely on the longer-term needs of the economy, not in response to short-term political pressures. Considerable evidence supports the view that countries with independent central banks enjoy better economic performance over time.However, in our democratic society, the Federal Reserve's independence brings with it the obligation to be accountable and transparent. The Congress and the public must have all the information needed to understand our decisions, to be assured of the integrity of our operations, and to be confident that our actions are consistent with the mandate given to us by the Congress.On matters related to the conduct of monetary policy, the Federal Reserve is one of the most transparent central banks in the world, making available extensive records and materials to explain its policy decisions. For example, beyond the semiannual Monetary Policy Report I am presenting today, the FOMC provides a post-meeting statement, a detailed set of minutes three weeks after each policy meeting, quarterly economic projections together with an accompanying narrative, and, with a five-year lag, a transcript of each meeting and its supporting materials. In addition, FOMC participants often discuss the economy and monetary policy in public forums, and Board members testify frequently before the Congress.

other,"House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Thursday vowed that President Joe Biden will face a ""reckoning"" for his handling of the US' exit from Afghanistan but stopped short of calling for his resignation or impeachment over the episode -- as some congressional Republicans have -- according to a source on a call between the leader and House GOP members.
McCarthy, who told his colleagues he had spoken to Biden earlier that day, also said during the call that the focus right now needs to be on getting Americans out of Afghanistan safely and suggested that GOP demands for Biden's immediate ouster are counterproductive, sources on the call told CNN.
The California Republican pressed Biden on the number of Americans who were still in Afghanistan, as well as military equipment, according to a source on the call.
""We are going to hold every single person accountable,"" McCarthy told members on the call.
The call, taking place hours after two explosions outside Kabul's airport killed 13 US service members and dozens of Afghans, according to the Pentagon and Afghanistan's Ministry of Public Health, comes as Republicans intensify their anger at the President over the chaotic situation in the country, with some pinning blame squarely on him and directly calling for his ouster.
Biden has noted that the US withdrawal was set in motion by former President Donald Trump's deal with the Taliban and vowed to not pass on a war entering its 20th year to a fifth US president -- a stance he reiterated in remarks Thursday evening.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki, when asked on Thursday about Republican calls for Biden to resign in the wake of the bombings, told reporters that ""it's not a day for politics.""
""This is a day where US service members, 12 of them, lost their lives at the hands of terrorists,"" Psaki said during the White House press briefing before another US death was announced. ""It's not a day for politics, and we would expect that any American, elected or not, would stand with us in our commitment to going after and fighting and killing those terrorists, wherever they live.""
Earlier Thursday, McCarthy had called on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to bring Congress back into session ""so that we can be briefed thoroughly and comprehensively by the Biden administration"" and pass a bill to prohibit the withdrawal of any more troops ""until every American is out of Afghanistan."""
other,"India's north-eastern state of Assam is advising locals against travelling to neighbouring Mizoram in the wake of violent clashes at the border.

Six policemen from Assam died and 80 others, including officials, were injured on Monday when police from the two states fired at each other.

Officials from both sides, including chief ministers, have accused each other of provoking the violence.

Although there has been no fresh violence, tensions continue.

Mizoram has accused Assam of mobilising police along the border, and has asked the federal government to intervene.

Assam has said it has withdrawn its forces, but Mizoram is yet to do so. It also alleged, in its travel advisory, that video footage showed civilians from Mizoram carrying automatic weapons along the border.

The advisory cited ""personal safety"" as the main reason and asked Assamese people who live in Mizoram to ""exercise utmost caution"".

The violence follows months of tensions over a long-running border dispute. The federal government has been trying to mediate a truce between the states since 1994."
other,"We review a growing literature that incorporates endogenous risk premiums and risk-taking in the conduct of monetary policy. Accommodative policy can create an intertemporal tradeoff between improving current financial conditions at a cost of increasing future financial vulnerabilities. In the United States, structural and cyclical macroprudential tools to reduce vulnerabilities at banks are being implemented, but may not be sufficient because activities can migrate and there are limited tools for non-bank intermediaries or for borrowers. While monetary policy itself can influence vulnerabilities, its efficacy as a tool will depend on the costs of tighter policy on activity and inflation. We highlight how adding a risk-taking channel to traditional transmission channels could significantly alter a cost-benefit calculation for using monetary policy, and that considering risks to financial stability-as downside risks to employment-is consistent with the dual mandate."
other,"On the domestic front, economic activity lost momentum in Q3 of 2015-16, pulled down by slackening agricultural and industrial growth. The north-east monsoon season ended in December with a deficiency of 23 per cent relative to the long period average (LPA). By end-January, rabi sowing was mildly deficient relative to a year ago, as well as to the quinquennial average in respect of all crops, except coarse cereals. Rural incomes will continue to be supported by allied activities such as dairy and horticulture, which now contribute as much to GDP as food grains.In the first two months of Q3 of 2015-16, industrial activity slowed in relation to the preceding quarter. This mainly reflects weak investment demand with some deceleration of capital goods production. Stalled projects continue to remain high, and there is a decline in new investment intentions, perhaps on the back of low capacity utilization. While revenue growth in manufacturing has been modest, the fall in costs, partly because of a decline in commodity prices, and partly because of improvements in manufacturing efficiency, have resulted in relatively stronger profitability. The Reserve Bank¡¯s industrial outlook survey suggests a modest expansion of activity likely in Q4. In January 2016, the manufacturing purchasing managers¡¯ index (PMI) expanded to a four-month high on, inter alia, resumption of output by firms affected by the December floods as well as on new domestic and export orders.Lead indicators of the services sector are mixed. Construction activity is still tepid, as evidenced by weak growth in cement production, though the pick-up in road construction bodes well for future activity, especially if supported by construction in the major proposed industrial corridors. Railway freight growth is still weak, though it may reflect lower transport needs for inputs like coal, and competition from roadways. However, the services PMI rose to a ten-month high in December on improvement in new business orders and upbeat expectations."
other,"In light of the effects of the continuing public health crisis on the economy and the associated risks to the outlook, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent since March 2020, when the global pandemic led the Committee to quickly lower the target range to the effective lower bound (figure 49).15 In its revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, issued in August, the Committee reaffirmed its commitment to achieving maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run and noted that ""following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time"" so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. (See the box ""The FOMC's Revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy."") The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved and has indicated that it expects it will be appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."

Typhoon,"American forces were dispatched to the Philippines as the Pacific island country struggled to cope Sunday after one of the most powerful storms in recorded history killed thousands — possibly as many as 10,000 — and wreaked damage far worse than expected.
“At the request of the government of Philippines, Secretary Hagel has directed U.S. Pacific Command to support U.S. government humanitarian relief operations in the Philippines in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan,” the Department of Defense said in a statement late on Saturday night.
The first wave of U.S. force — a team of 90 Marines and sailors — flew to Philippines on Sunday to assist with search and rescue operations and provide air support, the Marines said in a statement.
On Sunday afternoon, U.S. President Barack Obama released a statement saying:
“Michelle and I are deeply saddened by the loss of life and extensive damage done by Super Typhoon Yolanda. But I know the incredible resiliency of the Philippine people, and I am confident that the spirit of Bayanihan (communal work) will see you through this tragedy. The United States is already providing significant humanitarian assistance, and we stand ready to further assist the government’s relief and recovery efforts. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the millions of people affected by this devastating storm.”"
other,"MAS re-centred the S$NEER policy band upwards in April this year, with no change to the slope and width of the band, amidst tight factor markets and strong pressures on domestic costs and prices.  This was the third consecutive tightening move since April 2010, aimed at ensuring price stability in the medium term, while keeping growth on a sustainable path.From April to early September 2011, the S$NEER (Chart 1) had generally appreciated and remained within the upper half of the policy band.  This reflected the broad-based weakness in the US$ and investor interest in higher-growth economies.  However, the S$NEER has since fallen to the lower half of the band, reflecting a pullback in investor risk appetite on concerns over the deepening debt crisis in the Eurozone and softer growth prospects for Asia.  The domestic three-month interbank rate eased further after April, but has increased to 0.44% as of early October."
earthquake,"Sand Point’s docks and road damaged in 7.8 quake A magnitude-7.8 Aleutian earthquake late Tuesday night prompted tsunami warnings in communities across coastal Alaska, from Homer to Unalaska.  Sand Point is a fishing community of about a thousand people, located about 550 miles southwest of Anchorage in the eastern portion of the Aleutian Chain. Earthquake damage closed both its city docks, which it uses to land the M/V Tustumena ferry and freight boats, and damaged the road to the harbor. The floor sank in a warehouse on Sand Point’s old dock, creating a large crack across the length of the cement, according to City Administrator Jordan Keeler. He said a team of engineers will inspect the damage in the next week or so, and he’s confident that it looks worse than it actually is.  “We have two docks total and they are both closed, effective immediately until we can get an inspection to verify the extent of the damage to both the new dock and the old dock,” Keeler said.  In the meantime, closing down the docks could mean that freight shipments will be cancelled until they reopen. That could impact the island community’s ability to get fresh food, he added."
other,"Economic activity expanded at a moderate pace in the first half of 2010 after picking up in the second half of 2009. Some of the increase in real gross domestic product (GDP) in the first half of the year came from a continued turn in the inventory cycle. But more broadly, activity was bolstered by ongoing stimulus from monetary and fiscal policies and generally supportive financial conditions. In the labor market, payrolls rose modestly and hours per worker increased; nevertheless, employment remained significantly below pre-recession levels and unemployment receded only slightly from its recent high. Meanwhile, consumer price inflation edged lower."
drought,"Parts of southern Madagascar are under the worst drought conditions since at least 1981. The region is now in its fifth year of drought which wiped out harvests and hampered access to food. In three months to January 2021, there was less than 50% of the normal quantity of rainfall. In addition, up to 60% of harvests are expected to be lost in the coming months.
Southern Madagascar recorded another below-average cumulative rainfall this season, particularly in the Alaotra Mangoro, Analamanga, Haute Matsiatra, and Ihorombe regions.
This is the fifth below-average rainy season reported in southern Madagascar in the last six years, with the Grand Sud affected by its most severe drought since 1981.
The worst affected are children and women, with three out of four children quitting school, mostly to help their parents forage for food.
As of May 12, there are at least 70 000 children who are acutely malnourished and the number is rising daily, Welthungerhilfe (WHH) reports.
If rapid emergency assistance is not provided, there is a risk that the famine will spread, endangering the lives of up to a million people, WHH said.
Marlene Müller, WHH Programme Director described the situation in the south as dramatic.
""Our colleagues in the south report that some fields have turned to dust and sand because of the lack of rain,"" said Müller.
""The small farmers normally harvest their crops at this time of year to feed their families. Instead, the children must go hungry because they are not getting enough to eat. People are feeding on leaves, berries, and locusts. The small farming families have no way to get enough healthy food, or to earn an income.""
""They have no reserves left. Without rapid assistance from outside, they are threatened by starvation.""
Over the past six years -- 2015/16 - 2020/21 -- southern Madagascar has experienced five below-average rainy seasons. The past two consecutive below-average seasons have led to a severe reduction in staple food production and declined livestock herd size and body condition, FEWS reported."
Typhoon,"Typhoon Talas dumped record amounts of rain Sunday in western and central Japan, killing at least 20 people and stranding thousands more as it turned towns into lakes, washed away cars and triggered mudslides that obliterated houses. At least 50 people were missing, local media reported.
Evacuation orders and advisories were issued to 460,000 people in the region, which is hundreds of miles (kilometers) from the country's tsunami-ravaged northeastern coast.
At least 3,600 people were stranded by flooded rivers, landslides and collapsed bridges that were hampering rescue efforts, Kyodo News agency reported.
Public broadcaster NHK showed a bridge swept away after intense rain caused a river to swell with brown torrents. People holding umbrellas waded through knee-deep water in city streets and residential areas.
The typhoon dumped record amounts of rain in some areas, and more was expected. It was the country's worst storm since one in 2004 that left 98 people either dead or missing, the Yomiuri newspaper said. By Sunday, Talas had been downgraded to a tropical storm.
Ten people were killed and 32 were missing in Wakayama prefecture alone, police said. One landslide there buried three homes; a woman was killed and four people were missing, but a 14-year-old girl was rescued from the debris.
In nearby Nara prefecture, seven people were reported missing after their homes were swept down a river, NHK said. A 73-year-old man died in Nara when his house collapsed in a landslide, police said.
The storm damaged Nijojo castle in the ancient city of Kyoto, tearing a large piece of plaster from the gate wall. The castle, a popular tourist destination, is designated an important cultural treasure."
other,"In April 2006, MAS reaffirmed the policy of a modest and gradual appreciation of the S$NEER policy band.  This policy stance, which has been in place since April 2004, has contributed to the low inflation environment amidst the robust economic conditions of the past few years.The S$NEER has stayed in the upper half of the policy band since the last policy review.  (Chart 1)  This reflected a number of factors, including the weak US$ sentiment, strong investment inflows into emerging Asian markets, as well as a relatively buoyant Singapore economy.  In particular, both short-term and long-term capital inflows had increased significantly in the first half of this year.  More recently, the S$NEER eased in mid-September, due in part to a strengthening of the US$ following the G7 meeting last month.After a strong rebound last year, the three-month domestic interbank rate rose further to 3.56% in June 2006, before declining to 3.44% as at end-September.  Notwithstanding the general rise in interest rates, the demand for credit has picked up, particularly in industries such as construction and transport & communications."
other,"The rule of thumb for monetary policymakers has long been that if inflation is below official target ranges, short-term interest rates should be set at a level that spurs spending and investment. This approach has meant that once interest rates reach or approach zero, central banks have little choice but to activate large asset-purchase programs that are supposed to stimulate demand. When circumstances call for it, policymakers default to the predetermined scripts of neo-Keynesian economic models.But in too many cases, those scripts have led us astray, because they assume that monetary policy has a measurable and foreseeable impact on demand and inflation. There is plenty of reason to question this assumption.For starters, households have not responded to ultra-low interest rates by saving less and spending more. If savings no longer yield a return, people can¡¯t afford big-ticket items or pay for retirement down the road. Likewise, companies today are faced with so much uncertainty and so many risks that ever-lower costs of capital have not enticed them to invest more.It¡¯s easy to see why, despite the data, predetermined formulas are attractive to monetary policymakers. The prevailing wisdom holds that in order to return the inflation rate to a preferred level, any slack in the economy must be eliminated. This requires pushing interest rates as low as possible, and when these policies have run their course (such as when rates dip toward the negative), unconventional instruments like ¡°quantitative easing¡± must be deployed to revive growth and inflation. The paradigm has become so universally accepted _ and the model simulations underpinning central banks¡¯ decisions have become so complex _ that few are willing to question it. For individual central banks or economists, to do so would be sacrilege.Central banks do not completely deny the economic costs that these policies imply: exuberance in financial markets, financing gaps in funded pension systems, and deeper wealth inequality, to name just a few. But these costs are deemed an acceptable price to pay to reach the clearly defined inflation level."
other,"UK food producers and supermarkets are warning that empty shelves could persist through the year-end holiday season unless the government acts to ease a shortage of workers and truck drivers caused by Brexit and the coronavirus pandemic.
McDonald's (MCD) has already been forced to take milkshakes off its menu in the United Kingdom and Nando's has closed 45 restaurants because it was running out of its signature dish peri peri chicken. But suppliers are warning of further disruption that means Brits may have to go without holiday staples such as turkey and pigs in blankets when they celebrate the first Christmas after Brexit took full effect.
National chicken production has already been cut back by 10%, according to the British Poultry Council, which says that 16% of industry jobs are not currently filled. Christmas turkey production will be slashed by a fifth, the industry group estimates.
""When you don't have people, you have a problem — and this is something we are seeing across the whole supply chain. The labor crisis is a Brexit issue, and one that has been widely reported across the food and drink sector,"" Richard Griffiths, chief executive of the British Poultry Council, said in a statement.
Supermarkets are warning that shortages could worsen ahead of the crucial holiday shopping period. Richard Walker, the managing director of supermarket chain Iceland, told BBC Radio on Wednesday that stores are already running short of some products including bread and soft drinks. Meanwhile, the chain is struggling to build stock needed for the peak season.
""The shortages consumers are seeing from the likes of Nando's and McDonald's in recent days and weeks highlight the immense impact this [truck driver shortage] is having on businesses,"" Walker said in a statement. ""The real worry is that time is quickly running out as we approach the extremely busy Christmas period, during which a strong supply chain is vital for everyone."""
other,"Critics have praised Billie Eilish's hotly-anticipated second album Happier Than Ever for its unflinching portrayal of life as a teenage pop megastar.
The follow-up to her 2019 debut When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?, it addresses the pressures of fame, as well as weighty issues facing young women, including sexual coercion.
Reviewers said the record is ""defiant"" despite its ""muted"" tone.
The Guardian's Alexis Petridis gave the ""universally great"" album four stars.
He said that ""on perhaps the most anticipated album of 2021, Eilish uses subdued yet powerful song writing to consider how fame has seeped into every corner of her life.
""Listening to a pop star complaining about being a pop star is usually enervating. It says something about Eilish's skill as a song writer that, in her hands, the topic feels genuinely affecting.""
This is partly, he wrote, because despite her stratospheric success, Eilish continues to express her fears with relatable intimacy as pop's anti-hero."
other,"It¡¯s important to remember, however, that there¡¯s no guarantee that the short seller¡¯s expectation of a stock¡¯s market price decline will actually occur. If Stock A¡¯s market price instead increases to $150 per share when the borrowed shares must be returned, then that investor loses $50 per share from having to purchase shares at a higher price to return to the original share lender, thus paying the price for an incorrect expectation of share decline. That¡¯s how markets work and should work.  Accordingly, short sales are perfectly logical and legitimate transactions for traders who believe that a company¡¯s stock is overvalued. Indeed, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) determined short sales account for fully 49 percent of all listed equity share volume, and The Wall Street Journal¡¯s ¡°Business World¡± guru Holman Jenkins highlights how there¡¯s nothing salacious or even extraordinary about them.  Moreover, short sales serve a critical signaling role in markets and our economy, which is why efforts to restrict or even prohibit them are so dangerous. Contrarian short-sellers challenge conventional market wisdom, and thereby help identify potential bubbles, overpriced stocks, and wise investment opportunities. The stocks in question might be overpriced due to underlying improper internal business practices, as was the case with Enron, Tyco, and Worldcom. In other instances, the subject stocks might be overpriced due to looming technological innovations or market changes, and short selling signals approaching downturns like the 2008 housing market collapse to the rest of the world."
earthquake,"A strong earthquake killed at least six people and damaged buildings on Indonesia's main island of Java and shook the tourist hotspot of Bali, officials said Saturday. No tsunami warnings were posted.
The U.S. Geological Survey said the magnitude 6.0 quake struck off the island's southern coast at 2:00 p.m. local time (0700 GMT). It was centered 45 kilometers (28 miles) south of Sumberpucung town of Malang District in East Java province, at a depth of 82 kilometers (51 miles).
Rahmat Triyono, the head of Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami center, said in a statement the undersea earthquake did not have the potential to cause a tsunami. Still, he urged people to stay away from slopes of soil or rocks that have the potential for landslides.
Falling rocks killed a woman on a motorcycle and badly injured her husband in East Java's Lumajang district, said Raditya Jati, spokesperson for the National Disaster Mitigation Agency.
He said dozens of homes were damaged across the district, and rescuers had retrieved two bodies from the rubble of collapsed homes in the district's Kali Uling village. Two people were also confirmed killed in an area bordering Lumajang and Malang districts, while one person found dead under rubble in Malang.
Television reports showed people running in panic from malls and buildings in several cities in East Java province
Indonesia's search and rescue agency released videos and photos of damaged houses and buildings, including a ceiling at a hospital in Blitar, a city neighboring Malang. Authorities were still collecting information about the full scale of casualties and damage in the affected areas.
It was the second deadly disaster to hit Indonesia this week. On Sunday, a downpour triggered by Tropical Cyclone Seroja killed at least 165 people and damaged thousands of houses. Some were buried in either mudslides or solidified lava from a volcanic eruption in November, while others were swept away by flash flooding.
Indonesia, a vast archipelago of 270 million people, is frequently struck by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis because of its location on the ""Ring of Fire,"" an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin.
In January, a magnitude 6.2 earthquake killed at least 105 people and injured nearly 6,500, while more than 92,000 displaced, after striking Mamuju and Majene districts in West Sulawesi province."

The US Fed raised its policy rate by 25 bps each in December 2017 and March 2018 meetings. The March 2018 projections of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants suggest that the Fed could hike the policy rate two more times in 2018. In contrast, the ECB has maintained its ultra-accommodative policy stance and kept its rates at a record low. The strong euro is weighing on inflation and keeping it below the target. The Bank of Japan has continued with its ultraaccommodative stance as inflation has remained well below the target (Chart V.7a).Monetary policy stances remained diverse in EMEs, with many central banks in key EMEs reducing policy rates. Central Bank of the Russian Federation cut rates thrice _ in December, February and March _ with inflation developments remaining favourable, while Brazil has been cutting rates aggressively on underwhelming inflation. South Africa cut its policy rate in March on subsiding inflation. The People¡¯s Bank of China has left its benchmark one-year lending and deposits rates unchanged since October 2015, preferring to influence borrowing costs through liquidity operations and inter-bank market rates. Among other EMEs, Indonesia has kept its policy rate unchanged since the rate cut effected in September 2017. Turkey kept its policy rate unchanged as inflation remained elevated. Mexico raised its policy rate twice in December and March on rising inflation concerns (Chart V.7b)."
Typhoon,"The storm, named Bolaven, buffeted the west coast of South Korea with winds of up to 170 kilometers (106 miles) per hour, knocking out power to more than 200,000 homes.
According to South Korean emergency services, coast guard rescuers were able to save 10 fishermen from two Chinese ships after their boats capsized near Jeju island, about 100 kilometers south of the mainland. Five fishermen were thought to have perished. Ten crew members remain missing.
In the dramatic rescue, coast guard members in wetsuits overcame high waves by firing a line-launcher to attach ropes to one of the ships. According to AFP, the other boat broke apart.
In southern Wanju county, the public administration ministry said a 48-year-old man was killed when strong winds flipped over a shipping container, while in the southwest city of Gwangju an elderly woman was killed when a church spire fell onto her house. The public administration ministry also said another elderly woman was killed in Seocheon county on the country's west coast when she was blown off a roof.
Elsewhere, South Korea's transport ministry said that almost 250 flights, both international and domestic, had been cancelled since Monday, and that all 87 sea ferry services had been temporarily suspended. The US and South Korean military also decided to call off large-scale joint military exercises that began last week. The United States has a large military presence in South Korea."

The storm — known as Tropical Storm Nuri in China — will travel across the South China Sea this weekend, maintaining tropical storm status. As of 11 a.m. EDT Friday (11 p.m. Friday Hong Kong time), its sustained winds were 40 mph, with gusts of 50.
The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has issued a T1 tropical cyclone warning. This indicates that a tropical cyclone is centered within 500 miles (800 km) of Hong Kong, which may affect the city and its ports.
Winds and swells in Hong Kong are expected to gradually increase Saturday. The HKO will consider issuing the T3 strong wind warning depending on how badly conditions deteriorate. Meteorologists with the HKO are predicting gale force winds up to 54 mph for Saturday, flirting with severe tropical storm status (55 to 73 mph).
There’s a slim chance Nuri could strengthen into a typhoon — winds of at least 74 mph, like an Atlantic hurricane."
other,"A historical decomposition of inflation shows that large and sequential supply side shocks, emanating essentially from food group, have defined the overall change in headline inflation trajectory since Q3:2016- 17. In H1:2018-19, several factors impacted inflation _ a favourable food supply shock; an adverse oil price shock; and soft rural wage growth in spite of the quickening of agricultural activity and indications of firming up of rural demand (Chart II.6a).The pick-up in services inflation was led by elevated house rentals on the back of increase in HRA for central government employees. Inflation in other items of services _ education, transport and medical _ also firmed up. From July, however, goods inflation _ especially in respect of perishables _ pulled down overall inflation, helped by subdued month-on-month changes and favourable base effects (Chart II.6b).In terms of weighted contributions, the food group contributed 25.2 per cent to overall inflation during April-August 2018 in contrast to 8.9 per cent a year ago. The average contribution of food inflation to overall inflation in the last five years has been 47 per cent. Within food, inflation in cereals, which has a weight of 9.7 per cent in the CPI and 21.1 per cent in the food and beverages group, remained benign at sub- 3 per cent level during H1:2018-19, with production boosted by two consecutive years of record harvests, and stocks being well above buffer norms. The food inflation trajectory was largely shaped by vegetables, fruits, pulses and sugar during H1:2018-19, with its unexpected slump defying the usual seasonal uptick, especially in prices of vegetables during July-August (Charts II.7 and II.8)."

This policy stance was assessed to be appropriate given the broadly stable outlook for GDP growth and MAS Core Inflation.Since October 2017, the S$NEER has appreciated in the upper half of the policy band, apart from a brief period of decline in early 2018. This development reflected, in part, broad-based US dollar weakness and depreciation in a number of regional currencies against the S$. The three-month S$ SIBOR rose from 1.1% as at end-October 2017 to 1.5% at the end of the year, before falling in January 2018. It subsequently resumed its upward trend to reach 1.4% as at end-March."
earthquake,"SANTIAGO, CHILE - A 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck Saturday off the coast of Antarctica, with authorities issuing a tsunami warning for Chile's Eduardo Frei base on the frigid continent, emergency officials said.
The quake struck at 8:36 p.m. local time (2336 GMT) about 210 kilometers east of the base at a depth of 10 kilometers, Chile's National Emergency Office (Onemi) said, urging evacuation from ""the beach area of the Antarctic"" ahead of a possible tsunami.
The Chilean air force's base is the country's largest in Antarctica and includes a village, hospital, school, bank, post office and chapel.
The maximum population in summer is 150 people, and the average population in winter is 80.
An unrelated 5.9-magnitude earthquake struck near Santiago on Saturday night, but Onemi said no significant damage or impact was reported.
Chile is one of the most seismically active countries in the world. An 8.8 magnitude temblor in Concepcion on February 27, 2010, left more than 500 dead.
The country suffered the most powerful earthquake ever recorded 60 years ago — measuring 9.6 magnitude — in Valdivia."
other,"A new and more realistic monetary paradigm would discard overly rigid rules that embody the fallacy that monetary policy is always effective. It would give central banks more room to incorporate the risks and costs of monetary policies. With such a paradigm, central banks could move away from negative interest rates and large-scale asset purchases. They would define their inflation targets more flexibly, to avoid being forced into action whenever ¡°uncertainties¡± such as declining oil prices or required wage adjustments cause inflation to move above or below 2%.Perhaps most important, a new paradigm would acknowledge the limits of central banks¡¯ power and foresight. That would remove an alibi that governments too often hide behind to avoid introducing the structural reforms that really matter for long-term growth."
other,"In the unsecured call money market, private banks and primary dealers are the major borrowers, and cooperative banks and public sector banks are the major lenders. In terms of intra-day activity, a distinct U-shaped pattern is discernible, with the thickest part of trading _ more than 60 per cent of daily call money transactions _ occurring in the first hour (9-10 am) when primary dealers are most active as borrowers, and in the last hour (4-5 pm) when the call money market becomes the only source of market liquidity for banks and primary dealers. In both these time segments, public sector banks are the largest lenders. Co-operative banks accounted for 39 per cent of call money lending during the second half of 2017-18, down from 46 per cent in the first half.The demonetisation-induced slosh of liquidity hung heavily over the market in October and November. Amplified by the effects of the Reserve Bank¡¯s forex operations, it continued to impart a downside bias to the weighted average call rate (WACR), as in the preceding two quarters (Chart IV.1). By mid-December, however, liquidity tightened with advance tax outflows. Restrained government spending impacted call money market conditions from February and firmed up interest rates. As net liquidity absorption under the LAF steadily shrank through the second half of 2017-18, the spread between the WACR and the policy repo rate narrowed from (-)13 basis points in September 2017 to (-)5 basis points in March 2018 (Chart IV.2). With the narrowing of the LAF corridor to 50 basis points in April 2017 from 100 bps earlier, volatility in the call money market has reduced, while the volume has remained broadly unchanged at less than 10 per cent of the total overnight market (Charts IV.3 and IV.4)."

There were no immediate reports of injuries. The earthquake struck at 5:33 a.m. local time on Tuesday and was centered in Lake Kh_vsg_l in northern Mongolia, about 55 kilometers (34 miles) from the border with Russia, or 288 km (179 miles) southwest of Irkutsk. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) put the earthquake’s magnitude at 6.7, down from an earlier estimate of 6.8. It said the quake struck at a depth of just 10 km (6 miles) and was felt across the region on both sides of the border. The area near the epicenter is not heavily populated but is home to a number of villages near the lake, including Hatgal and Turt, which have a combined population of up to 5,000 people. There were no immediate reports of casualties. A 40-year-old resident in Darkhan, a city about 423 kilometers (263 miles) southeast of the epicenter, was woken up by the earthquake. “It was the strongest I’ve felt in my whole life,” the resident told BNO News. Indra Ganbaatar was also sleeping when the earthquake was felt in the capital Ulaanbaatar. “I felt a very strong tremor and woke up,” Ganbaatar said. “My whole bed was shaking. It was really scary. I was really scared.” Nil-Erdene Bayanburd, also from Ulaanbaatar, felt the quake as well. “Our dangly lights and lamps were swinging slightly, the desk was pretty shakey and everyone felt it in different regions across Ulaanbaatar,” Bayanburd said. Tuesday’s tremor was one of the strongest earthquakes to hit northern Mongolia in recent history."

The magnitude 6.9 quake hit offshore 99 kilometres (62 miles) southeast of Russia‘s Kuril Islands, the US Geological Survey (USGS) said on Thursday. It also struck off the coast of Japan’s northern main island of Hokkaido, according to Japan’s meteorological agency.  The agency said it was centred about 60 kilometres (100 miles) below the ocean’s surface and east of Etorofu island _ a Russian-held island that is also claimed by Japan. Officials said it was unlikely to cause injuries or damage because of its depth and distance from the coast."
wildfires,"At least 100 homes were destroyed and 700 residents were evacuated because of a wildfire in the Texas panhandle, authorities said.

“With the wind blowing the way it is, and the hot spots, the wind keeps switching from one direction to another so it's almost impossible [to fight],” Leggett said. “Plus, until daylight or they [have] got a lot better visibility, it's gonna be tough.”
Hutchinson County Emergency Management Coordinator Danny Richards said emergency crews from 26 counties were assisting. The fire was about 50 percent contained early today, he said, with a cold front giving firefighters optimism that the fire would be contained this morning.
Richards told ABC News that the fire had possibly burned more than 1,000 acres.
“It’s a disaster, and many people have lost their homes,” Richards said."
earthquake,"Reykjavik (CNN)Even for a volcanic island accustomed to the occasional tremor, this has been an unusual week for Iceland. According to the Icelandic Meteorological Office, around 17,000 earthquakes have hit the southwestern region of Reykjanes over the past week.
The largest quake, a magnitude 5.6 on the Richter scale, occurred on the morning of February 24. It was the loudest in a swarm that continues to rattle residents in the nearby capital city of Reykjavík and the municipalities around it, where two-thirds of the Icelandic population lives. Two larger earthquakes -- over magnitude 5.0 -- also hit on February 27 and March 1.
The quakes have caused little damage so far, though Iceland's Road and Coastal Administration has reported small cracks in roads in the area and rockfalls on steep slopes near the epicenter of the swarm.
""I have experienced earthquakes before but never so many in a row,"" Reykjavik resident Aueur Alfa ólafsdóttir told CNN. ""It is very unusual to feel the Earth shake 24 hours a day for a whole week. It makes you feel very small and powerless against nature."""
drought,"the ongoing drought could bring danger slithering right into your yard.
The dry conditions mean the most venomous snakes in Central Florida are on the move.
Herpetologist Bob Cross said low water levels in many lakes and swamps means snake sightings are more likely to happen in neighborhoods.
“It’s very frightening to think that they’re that they’re that close to a house,” Longwood resident Candy Bauer. ""I don't feel the same about my backyard.""
She found a cottonmouath in her backyard last night and called Cross to relocate the animal.
“Usually when people saw that, it’s a harmless water snake,"" Cross said. ""But in this case, the lady was right.""
He said the dry weather is forcing the cottonmouths and other snakes to seek water elsewhere.
""He’s going to be traveling like the gators,” Cross said.
He said a bite from a cottonmouth would cause severe pain and swelling.
""We'd be calling 911 and a helicopter for you,"" Cross said.
The snake found in Bauer’s yard will be sent to a facility in DeLand which will use it to produce anti-venom."
wildfires,"Green leaves have popped out on trees throughout interior Alaska, but the dry vegetation below is putting wildfire responders on edge.
Grasses still brown from a lack of spring rain, combined with high temperatures and low humidity, have made the region a tinderbox. The Yukon Flats, the Tanana River Valley and the Copper River Basin remain under “red flag” alerts and burn bans because of the high danger of fire.
“We still have a lot of dead, dry grass that could burn,” said Tim Mowry, information officer at the Alaska Interagency Coordination Center in Fairbanks. A meteorologist described the conditions as “an insanely dry air mass sitting on top of us,” Mowry said.
Temperatures this week edged into the high 70s and low 80s with low humidity, evaporating precious moisture from already dry undergrowth. The conditions are expected to last into Memorial Day weekend.
The same weather system is drying out southcentral Alaska and even making coastal rainforest on the Panhandle susceptible to forest fire, Mowry said.
In the last decade, an average of 1,875 square miles of forest has burned annually in Alaska. Many of the largest fires started by lighting in remote areas.
The state so far has recorded 27 wildfires, including nine still active, but they’ve covered only 5.3 square miles.
They include the Bolgen Creek Fire covering almost 1 square mile along the Steese Highway between Circle and Central. Fire officials reported Wednesday afternoon that the 179 people assigned to the fire had it 60 percent contained.
The Seaton Roadhouse Fire, burning on both sides of the Alaska Highway about 50 miles northwest of the Canada border, on Thursday was estimated at nearly 500 acres, or just under 1 square mile.
Traffic on the state’s highway to Lower 48 states was slowed to about 10 mph through a half-mile section of highway, and a pilot car led motorists through smoke.
The state Division of Forestry responded with aircraft — a water-scooping airplane, three retardant tankers and a helicopter dropping water — plus six ground crews.
All but one 2015 fire were caused by humans."
Typhoon,"At least 20 people were killed as Typhoon Goni lashed the Philippines over the weekend, and about 13,000 shanties and houses were damaged or swept away in the eastern island province that was first hit by the ferocious storm, officials said Monday.
Goni blasted into Catanduanes province at dawn Sunday as a super typhoon with sustained winds of 225 kilometers (140 miles) per hour and gusts of 280 kph (174 mph). But it weakened considerably after making landfall and shifted direction to spare the capital, Manila, before blowing out into the South China Sea.
The Office of Civil Defense said at least 20 people were killed in Catanduanes and nearby Albay province.
Catanduanes, an island province of more than 260,000 people that is often lashed by Pacific storms, was isolated after losing power and communications due to Goni and another typhoon that had hit a week earlier. But officials there managed to connect to the outside world on Monday after disaster-response authorities flew to the devastated island with satellite phones.
Catanduanes Gov. Joseph Cua and other officials said the typhoon whipped up 5-meter (16-foot) storm surges and damaged or swept away about 13,000 houses. Many residents fled to safety from their homes as the typhoon approached.
More than 66,000 other houses and huts were damaged elsewhere in the region, officials said.
Cua described the onslaught as “severe” and reported that some coastal areas were swamped by frightening storm surges.
About 80% of the electricity posts on the island were toppled and roads linking the province’s 11 towns remained impassable, Cua said.
An army general on the island appealed for more troops to help distribute food packs and water to residents. He added that the army camp was destroyed by the typhoon and soldiers have camped out at the airport, which remained open.
An air force cargo plane was to deliver food packs, drinking water, blankets and other relief goods to the province.
The typhoon also devastated the nearby province of Albay, where heavy rains washed down boulders and mudflows from Mayon Volcano, engulfing about 150 houses in a single community in the town of Guinobatan, Albay Gov. Al Francis Bichara said."
wildfires,"Wildfires continue to rage in Texas as extremely dry and windy conditions have turned the entire state into a giant tinder box where the smallest spark can set acres ablaze.
To date over a million acres have been affected and Texas Governor Rick Perry is requesting Major Disaster Declaration for the state of Texas as a result of the continuing wildfire dangers. In a letter sent to President Barack Obama over the weekend, the governor identified 252 Texas counties presently threatened or impacted by wildfires.
Since wildfire season began, Texas fire officials have responded to 7,807 fires across the state that have burned more than 1,528,714 acres and destroyed 244 homes. One firefighter has died and 18 others injured.
Near Strawn Texas, rancher Joel Stephens says fires have so far burned 1,200 acres of his family's ranch, but they've been lucky since nearly all their livestock are accounted for and the fire did not burn their house, hay or barns. There's still a threat though as winds switch direction. Stephens, who is also a firefighter, is prepared to take steps to save the home and barns should the fire start moving back.
He says the landscape around there resembles what you see with tornadoes. Some homes are devastated while others are intact almost like an oasis in the desert.
In some areas, town officials are packing up essential documents and closing courthouses as fires move closer. And homes in the fires path are being evacuated in order to save lives.
Firefighters from all over have moved into help control the blazes. ""When the fires first started, we had local firefighters, but now there are firefighters helping battle the blazes from other areas,"" says Stephens. And earlier this week the Texas Forest Service ordered additional aerial resources to help battle the wildfires
As Stephens was talking on the phone, he was watching fires blaze up again and moving with the changing wind directions. His ranch is still in danger, and unfortunately, the weather doesn't look like it will be changing anytime soon. But hopefully some unexpected showers will pop up soon and the winds will die down to help slow the movement of these fires."

The Dzukou range in which the majestic Dzukou valley, a tourist hot spot in Nagaland is located, caught fire on Tuesday afternoon.
Efforts to extinguish the wildfire in Dzukou range continued for the fifth day on Saturday, sources said. OSD of Nagaland State Disaster Management Authority, Johnny Raungmei said that IAF choppers were used to douse the fire on Friday.
On the Nagaland side, it is relatively controlled because of the preventive measure taken by the Kohima District Disaster Management Authority along with personnel from forest, police, fire and emergency services and volunteers from Southern Angami Youth Organisation. The fire has also spread to neighbouring Senapati district of Manipur.
”Based on the requisition by the state government, an IAF Mi-17V5 helicopter equipped with Bambi bucket for firefighting was used in Dzukou valley near Kohima,” said PRO (Defence) Kohima, Lt Col Sumit K Sharma. The IAF choppers conducted recce on Thursday, said Sharma, adding that the mission is still on and it would continue even on Saturday.
About the fire being completely doused, Raungmei said, ”We can’t rule out because as per the pilots there are multiple spots where the fire is burning”. Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) Kohima Rajkumar M said that as per the latest information from the Range Officer, Kohima, a stretch of about 5 km fire line has been cut in the priority area. As per the present situation, the main valley is safe from fire, he said."
other,"Retail inflation measured by the headline consumer price index (CPI) eased more than expected for the third consecutive month in October, driven down by a sharper than anticipated deflation in the prices of vegetables. Underlying this softer reading, however, was an upturn in momentum as prices rose month-on-month across the board. Still elevated prices of sugar and protein-rich items, coupled with a turning up of prices of cereals, pulses and processed foods pushed up the momentum of food prices, which partly offset the moderation in food inflation brought about by a strong favourable base effect. In the fuel category, inflation eased with the decline in LPG prices on an annual basis and a fall in electricity prices from a month ago. Inflation excluding food and fuel continues to show strong persistence. Although housing and personal care inflation softened marginally, the steady rise in inflation in respect of education, medical and health services, and transport and communication has imparted stickiness to inflation in this category.Liquidity conditions have undergone large shifts in Q3 so far. Surplus conditions in October and early November were overwhelmed by the impact of the withdrawal of SBNs from November 9. Currency in circulation plunged by _7.4 trillion up to December 2; consequently, net of replacements, deposits surged into the banking system, leading to a massive increase in its excess reserves. The Reserve Bank scaled up its liquidity operations through variable rate reverse repo auctions of a wide range of tenors from overnight to 91 days, absorbing liquidity (net) of _5.2 trillion. The Reserve Bank allowed oil bonds issued by the Government as eligible securities under the LAF. From the fortnight beginning November 26, an incremental CRR of 100 per cent was applied on the increase in net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) between September 16, 2016 and November 11, 2016 as a temporary measure to drain excess liquidity from the system. From November 28, liquidity absorption fell back and the Reserve Bank undertook variable rate repo auctions of _3.3 trillion on November 28. As expected, money market conditions tightened thereafter and the weighted average call rate (WACR) traded near the upper bound of the LAF corridor on that day before dropping back to the policy repo rate on November 30. All other rates in the system firmed up in sympathy, with term premia getting restored gradually. Through this episode, active liquidity management prevented the WACR from falling even to the fixed rate reverse repo rate, the lower bound of the LAF corridor. Liquidity management was bolstered by an increase in the limit on securities under the market stabilisation scheme (MSS) from _0.3 trillion to _6 trillion on November 29. There have been three issuances of cash management bills under MSS for _1.4 trillion by December 6, 2016. In the external sector, India¡¯s merchandise exports rebounded in September and October. The return to positive territory was supported by a pick-up in both POL and non-POL exports. After a prolonged fall for 22 months, imports rose in October on the back of a sharp rise in the volume of gold imports and higher payments for POL imports. Non-oil non-gold import growth also turned positive after a gap of seven months. For the period April-October, the merchandise trade deficit was lower by US $ 25 billion from its level a year ago. Accordingly, the current account deficit is likely to remain muted, notwithstanding some loss of remittances and software exports under invisibles. Net foreign direct investment has remained reasonably robust, with more than half going to manufacturing, communication and financial services. By contrast, portfolio investment outflows of the order of US $ 7.3 billion occurred in October-November from both debt and equity markets _ as in peer EMEs across the board _ reflecting a strong home bias triggered by the outcome of the US presidential election and the near-certainty of monetary policy tightening in the US. The level of foreign exchange reserves was US$ 364 billion on December 2, 2016."
other,"Over the course of this year, the recoveries in the United States and euro area economies have continued but growth has slowed in the Asian region. The slowdown in the Asian region has been associated with lower growth of global trade volumes and industrial production and has contributed to a decline in the prices of Australia's resource exports. Core inflation has generally been steady in both the advanced and emerging economies, but at rates below central banks' targets. Globally, monetary policy remains very accommodative and finance remains readily available to creditworthy borrowers.Chinese economic growth has eased over 2015, with weakness in construction contributing to a slowdown in the industrial sector. Although residential property prices have risen a little in recent months, sales have retraced some of the rise seen earlier in the year and real estate investment remains weak. In contrast, the pace of growth in consumption and in the output of the services sector has been maintained over 2015. Growth in infrastructure investment has moderated but remains high, supported by a pick-up in project approvals. The authorities have adjusted a number of policies to support demand, including a further easing of monetary policy in recent months."
Typhoon,"A powerful typhoon has battered the northern Philippines, toppling power lines and dumping heavy rain across mountains, cities and food-growing plains. At least one man was killed in a landslide and 45 fishermen are missing.
Typhoon Utor, described as the world's strongest so far this year, touched land in the mountainous eastern Aurora province with sustained winds of 109mph (175kmh) and gusts of up to 130mph.
Footage from ABS-CBN TV network showed a woman being swept away by a raging river in neighbouring Isabela province. The woman waved her hands for help as she struggled to hang on to debris while being buffeted by huge waves in the muddy waters. It was not immediately clear what happened to her.
""We have no official report yet, and we do not know if up to this time she has not been rescued,"" said Norma Talosig, a regional civil defence director. She said the woman lived alone in a low-lying area in San Agustin town and had refused to be evacuated.
In mountainous Benguet province, a 22-year-old man died on the way to hospital after he was pulled from a landslide that hit the roadside canal he was clearing, said regional civil defence official Andrew Alex Uy.
The typhoon triggered waves of up to 2.5 metres (8ft) and left scores of fishermen missing.
In northern Pangasinan province, 25 fishermen on board three boats failed to return home, said a provincial police spokesman, Senior Inspector Ryan Manongdo.
Twenty people from the eastern provinces of Catanduanes and Camarines Norte were also unaccounted for. Authorities were hoping they had taken shelter in coves and on nearby islands, said Bernardo Alejandro IV, the regional director for the office of civil defence.
""I hope they're just waiting for the typhoon to pass and will show up as soon as the weather clears,"" he said.
As of Monday afternoon, the typhoon had crossed the Philippines' main northern island of Luzon and was off the country's north-west coast with winds of 87mph and gusts of 106 mph, government weather forecaster Jun Galang said.
He said the typhoon may intensify over the South China Sea as it moves toward China. He said the storm carried a lot of rain but was moving fast, so the rainfall was not concentrated in one area. Utor was forecast to make landfall in Guandong, China, on Wednesday.
About 1,000 residents in the Bicol region of the central Philippines spent the night in shelters, while Aurora province was without power, the national disaster agency said. Radio stations reported roofs being blown off and a covered basketball court was washed away in Dinalungan town.
About 1,100 travellers remained stranded as passenger and cargo ferries were grounded. School classes in towns and cities on the typhoon's path were suspended, including in Manila, the capital. Several domestic flights were cancelled.
Utor, the Marshellese word for a squall line, is the 12th of about 20 storms and typhoons expected to hit the Philippines this year."
other,"President Joe Biden says US forces will end their combat mission in Iraq by the end of this year, but will continue to train and advise the Iraqi military.
The announcement came after Mr Biden held talks with Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi at the White House.
There are currently 2,500 US troops in Iraq helping local forces counter what remains of the Islamic State group.
Numbers of US troops are likely to stay the same but the move is being seen as an attempt to help the Iraqi PM.
The US presence in Iraq has become a major issue since top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani and the leader of an Iran-backed Shia Muslim militia were killed in a US drone strike in the capital Baghdad last year.
Political parties aligned to Iran have demanded the withdrawal of all forces from the US-led global coalition against IS, despite the continuing threat posed by the Sunni jihadist group.
Shia militias have meanwhile been accused by the US of carrying out hundreds of rocket, mortar and drone attacks on Iraqi military bases that host coalition forces in an apparent attempt to pressure them to leave.
For the US president, the announcement marks the end of another war that began under former President George W Bush. This year he said US troops would leave Afghanistan."
flood,"Blame game on after 60 mm rain in an hour floods Mumbai BJP leader Ashish Shelar said the first rain in Mumbai this season has exposed the BMC’s claim that 100 per cent nullahs have been cleaned. MUMBAI: Mumbai received about 60 millimetres of rainfall in an hour on Wednesday, leading to waterlogging in several places including Hindmata, Milan Subway and Sion. The flooding of the railway tracks led to brief suspension of suburban rail services.  Mayor of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) Kishori Pednekar blamed the railways for the flooding of the tracks and the adjoining areas. Pednekar said the Central Railway did not cooperate with the BMC, and therefore, the BMC could not conduct cleaning works in the nullahs and the adjoining areas that fall under the railways’ jurisdiction.  However, the Central Railway refuted her claim. Its spokesperson Shivaji Sutar said they have been in touch with the BMC officials to deliver the best possible services to the passengers. Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray visited the BMC’s disaster management room to take stock of the situation. BMC chief Iqbal Singh Chahal and Pednekar visited Hindmata."

drought,"Quick… If I say the word Florida, what images pop into your head? Palm trees, sandy beaches, rain and humidity?  However, rains were hard to come by this winter across Florida, leading to drought that currently ranks as the largest severe drought in almost five years for the state. As of May 4, an area of extreme drought has now been added to a half dozen counties.
In the latest update of the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 66% of the state was currently in some degree of drought. More than 39% of the state was in severe drought, 5% in extreme drought. That represents the largest portion of the state in severe drought since the beginning of June 2012.  And drought conditions have developed relatively rapidly as no part of the state was in severe drought as recently as only a month ago. What happened?
The better question is what didn’t happen. And the answer is rain. Rainfall totals during the winter were much below average. From December to February, central and most of southern Florida received 75% of its normal rainfall, with the driest areas seeing just 25-50%. And those months seem wet compared to the start of spring. In March, outside of localized areas in far southern Florida, the rest of the state recorded less than 50% of its normal rainfall, and large swaths of central and northern Florida were far lower, receiving less than 25% of their usual monthly rains. In absolute numbers, the driest areas saw less than an inch of rain in March. It was the ninth driest March on record back to 1895."

drought,"Manitoba farmer Chuck Fossay has never seen his fields this dry.
As he scoops up a handful of black top soil, it runs through his fingers like sand. 
""It's just bone dry. And there's nothing there to support the seed and the crop to grow,"" he said.
Farming near Starbuck, Man., about 20 minutes west of Winnipeg, Fossay is trying to get his canola into the ground. 
He's planting a little deeper this year, hoping to find moisture so the seeds can germinate and start growing.
He hopes that with some well-timed rain, he can still salvage a near-average crop but with conditions this dry, he said it's likely compromised before it's even planted.
""Dry is dry and nothing grows without water. That's just a fact of life. You need water to live. And if you don't have enough water, nothing grows,"" Fossay said.
""If we don't get a rain, a nice, general soaking rain probably the next two weeks, we're probably talking a crop failure out here in Manitoba."""
other,"Adjustments to the BI7DRR can also influence the exchange rate through the exchange rate channel.  A hike in the BI7DRR, for example, would increase the differential between interest rates in Indonesia and other countries.  A wider interest rate differential would attract non-resident investors to place capital in financial instruments in Indonesia seeking a higher rate of return. In turn, the foreign capital inflow would trigger rupiah appreciation, leading to cheaper imports and more expensive, or less competitive, exports from Indonesia, thus stimulating higher imports while simultaneously reducing exports.  Consequently, rupiah appreciation would ease inflationary pressures.   The impact of changes in interest rates on economic activity also influences public inflation expectations through the expectations channel.  Lower interest rates stimulate economic activity an increase inflation, with workers thus anticipating higher inflation and, hence, demanding higher wages.  Producers subsequently pass on the cost of higher wages to consumers by raising prices. The monetary policy transmission mechanism is characterised by a variable time lag.  The time lag associated with each transmission channel is different.  Under normal conditions, the banking industry will respond to increases/decreases in the BI7DRR by raising/lowering interest rates.  Notwithstanding, if the banking industry detects higher risk in the economy, the response to a downward BI7DRR movement is slower.  In addition, in the case of banking industry consolidation to increase capital, lower lending rates and increasing demand for loans do not necessarily increase bank lending in response.  On the demand side, consumers may not necessarily respond to lower lending rates in the banking industry through higher demand for loans if the economic outlook is weak.  Therefore, the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission is affected by external conditions, the financial sector and banking industry, as well as the real sector. __"
Typhoon,"Twenty-three people were missing as Typhoon Utor swept across the northern Philippines on Monday, ripping roofs off houses, tearing down power lines and triggering landslides in remote villages.
With wind gusts of 200 kilometres (124 miles) an hour, Utor was the most powerful storm to strike the Philippines this year and authorities were on alert for worst-case scenarios.
""This has the strongest sustained winds for the year,"" government weather forecaster Samuel Duran told AFP.
Hundreds of people die each year in the Philippines from the roughly 20 typhoons that strike the country annually.
There were no immediate reports of casualties from Utor on Monday morning, but the national disaster agency said it was concerned for 23 missing fishermen.
""They went out to sea before we declared that a storm was approaching,"" said National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council spokesman Reynaldo Balido.
""We are still hoping that within the day, they will return home. The practice in those areas is if a storm is approaching, they seek refuge somewhere.""
There were also concerns for remote towns and villages that had been isolated by the storm, with telecommunications networks to the areas out of order and roads cut off by landslides.
After building strength in the Pacific Ocean, Utor hit the northern regions of the main island of Luzon at 3:00 am on Monday (1900 GMT on Sunday).
Television footage from Aurora province, along the east coast of Luzon where Utor made landfall, showed uprooted trees that had fallen on top of houses, while roofs were ripped off some buildings.
The civil defence director for Aurora province, Josefina Timoteo, said reports had been received of more than 600 houses and 12 school buildings being damaged in one town, Dinalungan.
Alex Uy, the civil defence chief in charge of the northern mountain city of Baguio, said power outages were widespread across northern Luzon.
""The wind speed is strong enough to topple power lines. Even in our office, we have no electricity. We have to use a generator,"" Uy told AFP.
As of midday (0400 GMT), the storm was about half way across Luzon, passing over some of the most mountainous and isolated terrain in the country, moving westward towards the South China Sea.
It was expected to move out of the Philippines by late Monday, according to the weather bureau.
In Manila, the nation's capital, roughly 200 kilometres to the south of the storm, there was heavy rain overnight but no major flooding.
With more rain expected, many schools across the capital were closed on Monday.
Over a thousand people were killed when Typhoon Bopha hit the Philippines in December, the most devastating storm in the world for 2012."
wildfires,"Cool and relatively moist, Swedish summers aren’t known for promoting wildfire. Fires occur in most years, but not on the scale or intensity of the blaze that raged through boreal forests in August 2014.
It’s not clear how it got started, but fast-growing fire has consumed V?stmanland since July 31. In a week, the blaze grew to become the largest Sweden has seen in four decades. As of August 8, it had charred more than 150 square kilometers (60 square miles), killed one person, and forced thousands to evacuate their homes.
The Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat 8 captured this natural-color image of the fire on August 4, 2014. Multiple smoke plumes rise from the perimeter of the fire and blow northwest in the wind. Burned forest appears brown; unaffected forests are dark green; farmland is light green; and fallow fields are tan.
Hot and dry weather exacerbated the fire, stressing vegetation and priming it to burn. With a high-pressure system parked over Scandinavia, oppressive heat emerged across Sweden in July and August, bringing record or near-record temperatures to many towns and cities. In Sala, a city close to the fire, temperatures soared to 34.7°C (94.5°F) on August 5. Average temperatures are about 70°F (21°C) in early August.
Wildfires aren’t common or widespread in Sweden. According to a report published by the International Forest Fire News, only a few hundred hectares (100 hectares is equivalent to 1 square kilometer) generally burn during the nation’s wet summers, and a few thousand hectares burn during dry summers. That’s less than 0.02 percent of Sweden’s overall forest cover."

Typhoon,"Galveston, Texas: Hurricane Laura made landfall near Cameron in Louisiana on Thursday afternoon (AEST) as one of the region's worst hurricanes, threatening to devastate the US Gulf Coast with catastrophic storm surges, flash floods and powerful winds that could leave areas uninhabitable for weeks or months.
It came ashore as a category four storm with maximum winds of about 240km/h, according to the National Hurricane Centre. Laura is strong enough to rip down houses, uproot trees and cause power outages that could last weeks or even months.The storm is set to push a wall of water more than 6.1 metres high in some places on to shore, with potentially deadly effects - a catastrophic surge the centre earlier described as ""unsurvivable"".

other,"During the early 1980's, the Central Bank adopted monetary targeting as its monetary policy framework, and monetary aggregates became the key nominal anchor in the conduct of monetary policy. Under a monetary targeting framework, the changes in money supply are considered as primary causal factors affecting price stability. In general, two major definitions of monetary aggregates are considered in analysing monetary developments in Sri Lanka. The first is 'reserve money' consisting of currency issued by the Central Bank and commercial banks' deposits with the Central Bank. This is also called base money or high-powered money, as commercial banks can create deposits based on reserve money which are components of a broader definition of money supply, through their process of creating credit and deposits. The second is broad money defined as the sum of currency held by the public and all deposits held by the public with commercial banks. Studies have shown that the most appropriate monetary variable to analyse the relationship between the money supply and the general price level is the broad money supply.Given the rising volatility in money multiplier and velocity amid a weakening relationship between money supply and inflation, the role of monetary targets as a nominal anchor has become uncertain and also complicated the Central Bank¡¯s communication strategy. Accordingly, instead of reserve money, Central Bank currently uses average weighted call money rate (AWCMR) as its operating target under its enhanced monetary policy framework. However, although the Central Bank does not announce any monetary targets explicitly, broad money supply (M2b) remains the key indicative intermediate variable to guide monetary policy.The Central Bank conducts its Open Market Operations (OMO) within the corridor of interest rates formed by its policy rates i.e. the standing deposit facility rate (formerly the repurchase rate) and the standing lending facility rate (formerly the reverse repurchase rate), to achieve the intended inflation path. Policy rates are periodically reviewed and adjusted appropriately, if necessary, to guide the interest rate structure of the economy with a view to achieve the desired path of inflation."

Typhoon,"An approaching powerful typhoon has left at least one person dead, another missing and prompted the evacuation of more than 100,000 people as a precaution in the eastern and central Philippines, although the unusual summer storm is not expected to blow into land, officials said Monday.
Typhoon Surigae was about 500 kilometers (310 miles) east of Infanta town in Quezon province on Monday afternoon with sustained winds of 195 kilometers (121 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 240 kph (149 mph). It is forecast to slowly move northwestward and then veer eastward away from the northern Philippines around Thursday.
Vicente Malano, administrator of the government weather agency, said a high pressure area extending from China to Japan was blocking the typhoon from blowing inland.
“We’re lucky it’s not going to make landfall because if it hits land, it’s really going to be super devastating,” said Ariel Rojas from the weather agency.
The typhoon’s 900-kilometer (560-mile) band of rainclouds and strong winds nevertheless flooded at least 22 villages and caused power outages in four provinces. More than 3,200 people and 43 ferries and cargo ships were stranded in seaports after the coast guard suspended sea travel as the typhoon blew nearer, the government disaster-response agency and the coast guard said.

other,"Headline CPI inflation reached a peak of 5.2 per cent in December 2017 (4.9 per cent, excluding the estimated impact of HRA for central government employees), reflecting an unseasonal spike in the prices of vegetables and the full impact of the central government implementing the 7th Central Pay Commission¡¯s (CPC¡¯s) HRA award.

Cushioned by government spending and rural demand, manufacturing _ especially consumer non-durables _ and some categories of services, such as passenger vehicles and railway freight, have gradually recovered in Q2. The outlook for agriculture is robust. With merchandise exports slowly catching up to pre-COVID levels and some moderation in the pace of contraction of imports, the trade deficit widened marginally sequentially in Q2.Headline CPI inflation increased to 6.7 per cent during July-August 2020 as pressures accentuated across food, fuel and core constituents on account of supply disruptions, higher margins and taxes. One year ahead inflation expectations of households suggest some softening in inflation from three months ahead levels. Selling prices of firms remain muted, reflecting the weak demand conditions.Domestic financial conditions have eased substantially, with systemic liquidity remaining in large surplus. Reserve money increased by 13.5 per cent on a year-on-year basis (as on October 2, 2020), driven by a surge in currency demand (21.5 per cent). Growth in money supply (M3), however, was contained at 12.2 per cent as on September 25, 2020. Banks¡¯ non-food credit growth remains subdued. India¡¯s foreign exchange reserves stood at US$ 545.6 billion on October 2, 2020."
Typhoon,"Tropical Storm Fay makes landfall in New Jersey (CNN)Tropical Storm Fay made landfall Friday in New Jersey, about 10 miles north-northeast of Atlantic City, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm contains maximum sustained winds of about 45 mph, with higher gusts, but was weakening. It was moving north at 14 mph and should pick up speed through the evening and overnight as it moves through southeastern New York and western New England. Minor flooding was reported and there were no immediate reports of significant impact. As the system moves north over the next 24 hours, it will continue to bring a threat of flooding from New Jersey and Pennsylvania to New York and southern New England. Fay is expected to weaken to a tropical depression by Saturday morning, the NHC said."
other,"Since the MPC¡¯s meeting in February, lingering effects of the slowdown in the global economy in Q4 of 2020 have persisted, although recent arrivals of high frequency indicators suggest that a gradual but uneven recovery may be forming. The much anticipated boost to economic activity from the vaccination rollouts is being somewhat held back by new mutations of COVID-19, second and third waves of infections across countries and unequal access to vaccines more generally. World trade activity improved in Q4:2020 and January 2021. There are, however, concerns due to COVID-19-related fresh lockdowns and depressed demand in a few major economies, escalation in shipping charges and container shortages. Inflation remains benign in major advanced economies (AEs), although highly accommodative monetary policies and large fiscal stimuli have added to concerns around market-based indicators of inflation expectations, unsettling bond markets globally. In a few emerging market economies (EMEs), however, inflation is ruling above targets, primarily driven by firming global commodity prices. This has even prompted a few of them to raise policy rates. Equity and currency markets have been turbulent with the increase in long-term bond yields and the steepening of yield curves. More recently, however, calm has returned and major equity markets have scaled new peaks in March, while currencies are trading mixed against a generally firming US dollar. With the bond markets sell-offs, EME assets came under selling pressure and capital outflows imposed depreciating pressures on EME currencies in March."
flood,"More rain forecast for flood & landslide-ravaged Sri Lanka ECONOMYNECT – Rainfall is expected to temporarily increase over southwestern Sri Lanka over the next 48 hours, the Department of Meteorology said June 08 afternoon, requesting the public to take precautionary measures to minimse damage.  Sri Lanka is still reeling from extreme weather that has wreaked havoc in many parts of the country with 19 people dead and thousands displaced.  The Met Department said rainfall exceeding 75 milimetres is expected in parts of the Western, Sabaragamuwa and North Western provinces and in the Galle, Matara, Nuwara-Eliya, Mannar and Kandy districts.  Rainfall between 60- 95 millimetres have been forecast for parts of the Anuradhapura, Batticaloa, Colombo, Galle, Jaffna, Kandy, Nuwara Eliya, Ratnapura, Trincomalee and Mannar districts.  Two more deaths due to adverse weather were reported yesterday, increasing the total to 19, the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) said."
other,"The Bundesbank¡¯s core business area is monetary policy. In cooperation with the European Central Bank (ECB) and the other euro-area central banks _ which together form the Eurosystem _ the Bundesbank has been given the mandate of maintaining price stability. The Bundesbank President is a voting member of the Governing Council of the ECB and takes part in the monthly monetary policy decision-making process. In doing so, he draws on the expertise of the Bundesbank¡¯s economists, statisticians and monetary experts.A stable currency is the foundation of a healthy economy. It protects savers and income earners from the erosion of wealth while promoting growth and employment. The Governing Council of the ECB defines price stability as an increase in the euro area¡¯s average price level of below but close to two percent compared with the previous year. With the help of monetary policy measures, the Eurosystem indirectly exerts influence on general price developments. For this purpose, it changes the cost at which commercial banks can obtain cash and credit from the Eurosystem by altering the key interest rate. In so doing, it influences both the interest rates at which commercial banks lend money to each other and credit conditions for households and enterprises. Because the level of lending rates generally plays an important part in purchasing and investment decisions, monetary policy measures affect aggregate demand and ultimately also price developments."
Typhoon,"On 1 November 2020, Typhoon Goni made landfall as a super typhoon (Category 5) over Catanduanes with maximum sustained winds of 225 kilometers per hour and gusts of up to 280 kilometers per hour. Its the Philippines’ nineteenth named storm for year 2020. Typhoon Goni is considered as the strongest landfalling tropical cyclone in world recorded history.
At its peak strength on landfall on Catanduanes and Albay, Super Typhoon Goni caused widespread damage to high-risk structures and almost total damage to structures made of light materials in the highly exposed coastal areas. Many roof failures were observed in houses and industrial buildings. Electrical power distribution and communication services were severely disrupted. Water systems were severely damaged. Agriculture and livelihoods were severely affected. In one area, on the slopes, of Mayon Volcano there was a lahar flow that caused the near total destruction of one village."
earthquake,"Parts of Iceland were rocked by a 5.6-magnitude earthquake on Wednesday as residents reported shaking buildings and strong tremors.
The quake's epicentre was recorded about 25 miles away from Reykjavik, in the Reykjanes Peninsula region, on Iceland's southeast coast.
The effects of the quake, which struck at a depth of around six miles, were felt in Reykjavik and the surrounding areas.
It was not immediately clear if there had been any damage to property or injury to life.
“Spent the morning shaking around the office, geologists all running around like excited puppies. So much shaking,” Rob Askew, a geologist at the Icelandic Institute of Natural Science in Reykjavík, tweeted."
other,"The financial crisis prompted several important changes in monetary policy implementation. As part of its effort to counteract the economic effects of the crisis, the FOMC reduced its target for the federal funds rate in a number of steps from 5_ percent in mid-2007 to a range of zero to _ percent in December 2008. With short-term interest rates effectively constrained at the zero lower bound, the FOMC shifted the focus of its monetary policy implementation directives to the SOMA portfolio. Changes in the size and composition of the portfolio allowed for further easing of monetary conditions.In 2014, the FOMC indicated that there would be two main components to monetary policy normalization: gradually raising the target range for the federal funds rate to more normal levels and gradually reducing the SOMA's securities holdings. The FOMC outlined its intended approach to these objectives in a statement of Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, initially published in September 2014 and periodically updated with additional details.In December 2015, the FOMC raised its target range for the federal funds rate for the first time since the financial crisis and indicated that adjustments to short-term interest rates once again would be the primary tool for adjusting the stance of monetary policy. Yet with an abundant supply of reserve balances, implementation of monetary policy required a new operational approach, because small variations in the supply of reserves would no longer cause meaningful changes in the federal funds rate.In September 2017, the FOMC announced its intention to begin normalizing the SOMA portfolio in October 2017, by gradually and predictably reducing its reinvestment of principal payments received from SOMA securities."
drought,"Coyotes are stealing watermelons from backyard gardens, bees are attacking joggers trying to quench their thirst from drinking fountains, fighting for precious drops of water.
Texas state officials are planning now how to evacuate several endangered species at risk because of the record drought. The state is home to 86 threatened species.
Parched skies and relentless 100 degree heat are turning this summer into one of the worst in history here. Joggers run in the early morning before the heat intensifies; people working in downtown Houston seek shelter in the city's underground tunnel system rather than venturing out on the scorched city sidewalks. Football players practice in the morning to beat the heat, and children spend recess in air conditioned gyms at school.
The heat has driven wildlife into the open -- one homeowner southwest of Houston, who was wondering what was happening to his disappearing watermelon crop, set up a camera, and snapped a photo of a coyote in his backyard, stealing a watermelon.

drought,"The water crisis along the California-Oregon border went from dire to catastrophic this week as federal regulators shut off irrigation water to farmers from a critical reservoir and said they would not send extra water to dying salmon downstream or to a half-dozen wildlife refuges that harbor millions of migrating birds each year.
In what is shaping up to be the worst water crisis in generations, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation said it will not release water this season into the main canal that feeds the bulk of the massive Klamath Reclamation Project, marking a first for the 114-year-old irrigation system. The agency announced last month that hundreds of irrigators would get dramatically less water than usual, but a worsening drought picture means water will be completely shut off instead.
The entire region is in extreme or exceptional drought, according to federal monitoring reports, and Oregon’s Klamath County is experiencing its driest year in 127 years.
“This year’s drought conditions are bringing unprecedented hardship to the communities of the Klamath Basin,” said Reclamation Deputy Commissioner Camille Calimlim Touton, calling the decision one of “historic consequence.” “Reclamation is dedicated to working with our water users, tribes and partners to get through this difficult year and developing long-term solutions for the basin.”
The canal, a major component of the federally operated Klamath Reclamation Project, funnels Klamath River water from the Upper Klamath Lake just north of the Oregon-California border to more than 130,000 acres (52,600 hectares), where generations of ranchers and farmers have grown hay, alfalfa and potatoes and grazed cattle.
Only one irrigation district within the 200,000-acre (80,940-hectare) project will receive any water from the Klamath River system this growing season, and it will have a severely limited supply, the Klamath Water Users Association said in a statement. Some other farmers rely on water from a different river, and they will also have a limited supply.
“This just couldn’t be worse,” said Klamath Irrigation District president Ty Kliewer. “The impacts to our family farms and these rural communities will be off the scale.”
At the same time, the agency said it would not release any so-called “flushing flows” from the same dam on the Upper Klamath Lake to bolster water levels downstream in the lower Klamath River. The river is key to the survival of coho salmon, which are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. In better water years the pulses of water help keep the river cool and turbulent — conditions that help the fragile species. The fish are central to the diet and culture of the Yurok Tribe, California’s largest federally recognized tribe."
other,"As I noted earlier, the pace of recovery slowed last spring--to a rate that, if sustained, would have been insufficient to make meaningful progress against unemployment. With job creation stalling, concerns about the sustainability of the recovery increased. At the same time, inflation--already at very low levels--continued to drift downward, and market-based measures of inflation compensation moved lower as investors appeared to become more concerned about the possibility of deflation, or falling prices.Under such conditions, the Federal Reserve would normally ease monetary policy by reducing the target for its short-term policy interest rate, the federal funds rate. However, the target range for the federal funds rate has been near zero since December 2008, and the Federal Reserve has indicated that economic conditions are likely to warrant an exceptionally low target rate for an extended period. Consequently, another means of providing monetary accommodation has been necessary since that time. In particular, over the past two years the Federal Reserve has eased monetary conditions by purchasing longer-term Treasury securities, agency debt, and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) on the open market. The largest program of purchases, which lasted from December 2008 through March 2010, appears to have contributed to an improvement in financial conditions and a strengthening of the recovery. Notably, the substantial expansion of the program announced in March 2009 was followed by financial and economic stabilization and a significant pickup in the growth of economic activity in the second half of that year.In August 2010, in response to the already-mentioned concerns about the sustainability of the recovery and the continuing declines in inflation to very low levels, the FOMC authorized a policy of reinvesting principal payments on our holdings of agency debt and agency MBS into longer-term Treasury securities. By reinvesting agency securities, rather than allowing them to continue to run off as our previous policy had dictated, the FOMC ensured that a high level of monetary accommodation would be maintained. Over subsequent weeks, Federal Reserve officials noted in public remarks that we were considering providing additional monetary accommodation through further asset purchases. In November, the Committee announced that it intended to purchase an additional $600 billion in longer-term Treasury securities by the middle of this year."
flood,"Timor-Leste: UN agencies support response in wake of deadly floods United Nations agencies in Timor-Leste are supporting response efforts, as floods and landslides left widespread damage across the country, including in capital Dili.  According to media reports, at least 21 people died in the country and many more are missing. Large parts of Dili are inundated, with water level as high as two meters reported in some neighbourhoods.  Severe damage has also been reported to critical infrastructure, including roads, bridges and medical centres. Communication networks and electricity are said to be disrupted in some of the worst affected areas.  Roy Trivedy, UN Resident Coordinator in Timor-Leste said that UN agencies and partners are supporting the national response, adding that ""as an emergency response measure, [we] extend full support to the people and Government of Timor-Leste in this hour of need.""  ""We are deeply concerned about the communities, especially women and children, who are often most affected by natural disasters. We will work with the authorities to mobilize all possible resources to support the response"", Mr. Trivedy added."
Typhoon,"“The United Nations agencies in the Philippines, with their humanitarian partners, are supporting the Government and other responders in their efforts to assess the situation and respond rapidly with vital supplies, through the coordination system led by the local authorities,” said Emergency Relief Coordinator Valerie Amos.
This morning, the UN Disaster Coordination Team (UNDAC) arrived in the city of Tacloban, one of the most affected areas, and reported scenes of total devastation, with all roads from the airport to the town blocked. The UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Food Programme (WFP) have also mobilized their in-country teams to reach those affected.
The Philippines Red Cross said it has received reports of 1,200 deaths in two areas hit by the typhoon, a drastic increase from the three reported yesterday.
“Sadly, it is likely that this figure will rise,” Ms. Amos said. ""The Government estimates that some 4.3 million people are affected, across 36 provinces, and initial assessments show that thousands of homes have been destroyed, roads are impassable and people need food, water, shelter and power.”
According to UNICEF, up to 1.7 million children could be affected by Haiyan. The agency has already mobilized its staff to deliver pre-positioned emergency supplies, and is flying in some 60 metric tonnes of additional supplies from Copenhagen, including medical and shelter equipment. They are expected to arrive within the next three days.
“UNICEF's first priorities are focused on life-saving interventions _ getting essential medicines, nutrition supplies, safe water and hygiene supplies to children and families,” said UNICEF's representative in the Philippines, Tomoo Hozumi.
In addition, the World Food Programme (WFP) has mobilized $2 million for the response, and will be appealing for more funds as the needs become clearer. As a preliminary measure, 40 metric tonnes of high-energy biscuits will be flown in from Dubai in the coming days. These are often provided in the early days of a crisis as they are light to transport and do not need cooking. WFP is also looking at other food commodities to stabilize the nutrition situation.
“The devastation we saw in Tacloban today was shocking,” said WFP Representative and Country Director Praveen Agrawal. “People have lost their homes and livelihoods, and the damage to infrastructure is substantial.""
In a statement issued by his spokesperson, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he was deeply saddened by the extensive loss of life and the serious damage to the infrastructure of the country.
“The Secretary-General offers his sincere condolences to the people and Government of the Philippines, particularly to those who have lost family members, their homes or have been otherwise affected by this disaster,” the statement said.
Haiyan, known locally as Yolanda, is one of the strongest storms ever recorded, hitting landfall with sustained winds of 295 kilometres per hour (kph), placing it above the 252 (kph) threshold for a Category 5 hurricane, the highest category on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. The typhoon is expected to hit Viet Nam later today.
Haiyan is the third major crisis to hit the Philippines in just two months. In October, the Bohol earthquake affected more than 3 million people, triggering landslides engulfing entire homes, ripping apart bridges and tearing down centuries-old churches. Seven cities in three different provinces were initially affected. In September, tens of thousands were forcibly displaced by armed clashes in Zamboanga City in the southern part of the country."
drought,"The Czech Republic is experiencing a catastrophic drought, threatening their harvest and supply of water, Environment Minister Richard Brabec announced Wednesday, April 29, 2020. This has been the country's worst dry spell in 500 years.
A map presented by the minister showing that just 0.1 percent of the nation had a normal level of water in the soil in mid-April, while 75.4 percent is facing severe drought.
Rain and snowfall have been declining in the past decade while warming temperatures led to periods of dry spells in the land-locked country. This year, the combination of warm winter and lack of precipitation led to a ""catastrophic"" situation, said Brabec. Scientists also showed data that the country is in its worst drought in five centuries.
""We are facing an unprecedented drought period, both in its duration and its impact,"" he stated. ""Smaller rivers will dry out, there may be tens, perhaps hundreds of communities supplied by cisterns, because their sources may dry out.""
The situation is worsened as most rivers flow out of the country and by intensive farming. In its Communist era of forced collectivization, fields were joined into some of Europe's biggest single-crop units, while other dividers were pulled out. This has reduced the landscape's ability to retain water, leaving the country grappling to maintain sustainable water levels.
The dry spell and warmer temperatures also led to the bark beetle spread, which infested the nation in 2019, resulting in about 1.7 billion dollars worth of damage.
The Environment Ministry is appealing for financial assistance to fight the drought-- a move that could help harvests, such as grains and rapeseed.
Although the COVID-19 crisis is the country's most pressing issue currently, Brabec noted that climate change and drought will become the biggest problems in the following years.
""Unless there is a miracle that would bring a month-long continuous rain, we will see rivers and streams dry out and tens or hundreds of villages with no source of drinking water."""

More than 15,000 people have been temporarily displaced in 15 IDP sites, and figures are increasing.
The quake severely damaged buildings and houses, including a hospital that was completely flattened, trapping dozens of patients and staff in the rubble. Preliminary assessments indicate that 17 schools have been damaged.
Heavy rains in recent days have made access very difficult, blocking the main road to the affected areas.
The first priority is to search for survivors who have been trapped under the rubble, and to tend to the wounded.

other,"The High Powered Committee on Urban Cooperative Banks (UCB), chaired by Shri R. Gandhi, the then Deputy Governor of Reserve Bank, had, inter alia, recommended the voluntary conversion of large Multi-State UCBs into Joint Stock Companies and other UCBs which meet certain criteria into Small Finance Banks (SFBs). Taking these recommendations into consideration, it has been decided to allow voluntary transition of UCBs meeting the prescribed criteria into SFBs. The detailed scheme will be announced separately.In February 2018, banks and NBFCs were allowed to temporarily classify their exposures to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) registered Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), having aggregate credit facilities from these lenders up to _250 million, as per a 180 day past due criterion, subject to certain conditions. This was done with a view to ease the transition of MSMEs to the formalised sector post their registration under the GST.Having regard to the input credit linkages and associated issues, it has now been decided to temporarily allow banks and NBFCs to classify their exposure, as per the 180 day past due criterion, to all MSMEs with aggregate credit facilities up to the above limit, including those not registered under GST. Accordingly, eligible MSME accounts, which were standard as on August 31, 2017, shall continue to be classified as standard by banks and NBFCs if the payments due as on September 1, 2017 and falling due thereafter up to December 31, 2018 were/are paid not later than 180 days from their original due date.In view of the benefits from increasing formalisation of the economy for financial stability, the 180 day past due criterion, in respect of dues payable by GST registered MSMEs from January 1, 2019 onwards, shall be aligned to the extant norm of 90 day past due in a phased manner, whereas for entities that do not get registered under GST by December 31, 2018, the asset classification in respect of dues payable from January 1, 2019 onwards shall immediately revert to the 90 day norm."
other,"Since the last meeting of the MPC in April, global economic activity has continued to expand, though there has been some easing of momentum. Among advanced economies (AEs), the US economy began the year on a weak note on soft private spending and reduced residential investment; however, there seems to be a rebound in Q2:2018 with strong retail sales and improved employment data. The Euro Area growth decelerated in Q1; recent industrial production data as well as weak consumer and business sentiment suggest a loss of pace. The Japanese economy contracted in Q1, though it is expected to turn around in Q2 as indicated by recent data prints on exports and the manufacturing purchasing managers¡¯ index (PMI).Economic activity in major emerging market economies (EMEs) remained largely resilient. The Chinese economy maintained a strong momentum in Q1; more recent data on industrial production and PMI suggest that growth is likely to hold steady in Q2. The Russian economy appears to have picked up in recent months after a soft end to 2017; both manufacturing and services PMI rose in April. In South Africa, growth prospects have improved with the return of political stability as reflected in consumer confidence, manufacturing PMI and retail sales. In contrast, a stream of poor data from Brazil on high unemployment and soft industrial production show that the effects of recession linger."

Videos on the internet, apparently filmed by onlookers from buildings across the street from the French embassy, showed the gunman inside the guardhouse. He exchanged fire at very close range with police and men who appeared to be embassy guards.
Police said the attacker had first shot two police officers with a pistol at an intersection in the district, which houses a number of diplomatic missions. He took rifles from the fallen police officers, and headed on foot to the French embassy a few hundred meters away, firing randomly and occupying the guard house.

other,"Growth in economic activity in Australia's major trading partners has remained a little below average over the first half of 2016. Despite this, commodity prices overall have increased since the beginning of the year, partly because of reductions in supply by some high-cost producers of commodities, including iron ore and coal. The outlook for overall growth in Australia's major trading partners and the outlook for the terms of trade are little changed from three months ago. The terms of trade are forecast to remain close to current levels over the next couple of years. This is around 35 per cent lower than their peak in late 2011, but still well above levels that prevailed prior to the mining boom.In China, subdued growth in private sector investment has been only partially offset by additional policy measures to support demand. Conditions in the Chinese residential property market have eased a little recently, while growth in the services sector has remained relatively strong. The effects of the gradual easing in economic growth in China have been evident in a number of east Asian economies and emerging economies in other regions that have strong trade links to China. The outlook for the Chinese economy remains an important source of uncertainty for global growth and demand for commodities. A substantial slowing in demand in the Chinese property market would pose risks for property developers and related industries, including the steel industry. There is also uncertainty related to how the Chinese authorities will respond to the difficult trade-off involved in supporting growth and avoiding financial disruption in the near term, while achieving more financial discipline and broader reforms over the longer term."

As these are rolled out, health-related restrictions can be eased and many types of activity can return to something close to their pre-pandemic trends. In the near term, however, some momentum in the global economy has been lost, as infection rates have surged in a number of economies and lockdown measures have again become necessary. The recovery is likely to be bumpy and uneven, and dependent both on the health situation and ongoing fiscal and monetary policy support. Spare capacity will remain for some years, dampening inflationary pressures."

drought,"Governor Jerry Brown has ordered California to adopt permanent water conservation measures in response to a devastating five-year drought, including long-term bans on wasteful practices and mandatory reporting rules.
While the drought has become less severe in recent months – leading some communities and water agencies to abandon strict restrictions – Brown’s executive order on Monday made clear that the drought was not over and that California must transition its short-term emergency measures into a permanent conservation plan.
“Californians stepped up during this drought and saved more water than ever before,” Brown said in a statement. “But now we know that drought is becoming a regular occurrence and water conservation must be a part of our everyday life.”
Water officials on Monday also announced that the state is considering lifting a mandatory conservation order for cities and towns – an emergency rule adopted last year that requires at least 20% overall conservation by most water districts.
On 18 May, the state’s water resources control board will weigh a proposal to allow cities and water agencies to set their own conservation targets based on their projected shortages if the drought continues for three more years.
Under the new order from Brown, who adopted mandatory cuts for urban water use one year ago, California will “permanently prohibit wasteful practices, such as hosing off sidewalks, driveways and other hardscapes, washing automobiles with hoses not equipped with a shut-off nozzle, and watering lawns in a manner that causes runoff”, according to the governor’s office.
Urban water suppliers will also be required to permanently report data on water use, conservation and enforcement, and the state will develop new “water use efficiency targets” that go beyond a goal of 20% reduction by 2020 that officials originally adopted in 2009."
other,"The Australian economy remains on track to achieve lower unemployment and higher inflation over time. Supported by accommodative domestic monetary policy and a positive international outlook, GDP growth is expected to be a little above 3 per cent in both 2018 and 2019, which will reduce spare capacity. The unemployment rate is therefore forecast to decline, reaching around 5 per cent by end 2020. As the labour market tightens, wages growth and inflation should increase gradually. Temporary factors affecting administered prices are likely to hold inflation down in the very near term. Beyond the next quarter or so, the inflation outlook is essentially unchanged from three months ago.The global economic outlook remains positive, despite the recent increase in trade tensions. Output growth has been quite strong in a number of key trading partners in the June quarter. Global growth is expected to slow a little, but remain above trend, over coming years. At present, central banks in the major advanced economies are at different stages of their monetary policy cycles, with some reducing policy accommodation and others adding to it."
other,"The Bank has been expecting for some time that inflation will increase gradually over the period ahead, to be above 2 per cent. Recent data have been consistent with this expectation. Headline inflation in the March quarter was a little above 2 per cent and is now expected to be between 2 and 3 per cent throughout the forecast period. Underlying inflation increased in the March quarter, to around 1_ per cent. It is expected to increase further, to be around 2 per cent in early 2018. These forecasts are little changed from the previous Statement on Monetary Policy.A number of other factors have afforded increased confidence in the central forecast that inflation will increase gradually. The December quarter national accounts confirmed that the period of weakness in the middle of 2016 was only temporary. The stronger near-term global outlook now seems fairly well in train and the terms of trade have held up for a bit longer than earlier expected, which will provide a boost to national incomes."

Cal Fire fire captain Mike Mohler told NBC News with the lack of moisture, “You get explosive fire growth.”
The peak for California’s wildfires is usually summer into early fall, intensifying by late-September or October due to Santa Ana and Diablo winds, weather.com senior meteorologist Jon Erdman explained in an earlier story. The threat typically diminishes in the winter, which is considered the region's ""wet"" time of year, because of growing mountain snowpack and returning moisture. 
But during the last two winter seasons, the rain and mountain snow totals in the region were well below average. The lack of moisture is no more apparent anywhere else than it is in the California's Sierra Nevada mountain range, where snowpack has plunged to record lows.
“The outlook in California is pretty dire,” Wally Covington, a leading fire ecologist at Northern Arizona University told Grist. “It’s pretty much a recipe for disaster.”
In fact, while the national wildfire tally has been below average this year, the average in California has been 38% above average, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Over 4,000 acres have burned in California this year, which is almost double the amount at the same time last year. 
The community of Swall Meadows, nestled in the Eastern Sierra, is one example of the growing hazard of explosive fires, as they experienced a blaze that burned 35 homes and swept over 7,000 acres of land this past winter, San Jose Mercury News reported."
valcano eruption,"New Zealand volcano eruption: What you need to know about White Island SINGAPORE: White Island, one of New Zealand's most active volcanoes and a tourist attraction, suddenly erupted on Monday (Dec 9), spewing a plume of ash 12,000 feet (3,658m) into the sky. The eruption, although labelled “short-lived”, “not particularly big” and “almost like a throat clearing kind of eruption” by New Zealand’s geoscience agency GNS Science, has killed at least five and injured several others. Amid rescue efforts, here is a look at the volcanic island located 50km from the east coast of North Island."
valcano eruption,"Eritrean volcano eruption won’t disrupt Israeli air traffic Israel Meteorological Service says volcano shouldn't have an affect on air routes. Following a second _ and stronger _ eruption of the Dubbi volcano in Eritrea, the Israel Meteorological Service still maintains that there should be no affect on the nation’s air traffic. The volcano erupted for the first time in the East African country at 9 p.m. on Sunday, according to the Toulouse regional office of the Volcanic Ash Advisory Center, reportedly set off by a series of earthquakes."
Typhoon,"Tropical storm Arthur tracks NC coast. Cyclone Amphan threatens India/Bangladesh Tropical storm Arthur, the first named storm of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, formed at the weekend off the coast of Florida as an early reminder of the months to come. Arthur remains a weak tropical storm and is expected to near the North Carolina coast but then curve out to sea. Meanwhile, a much more dangerous tropical cyclone named Amphan is set to bring dangerous conditions to India and Bangladesh later this week, with the Category 4 equivalent strength storm set to bring hurricane force winds and a storm surge to a region populated by millions of people. Tropical storm Arthur: First, tropical storm Arthur which became an early pre-season tropical storm, as we suggested it would on Friday. Tropical storm Arthur is moving north in-line with the eastern seaboard of the United States, passing the Carolina’s. Tropical storm Arthur is forecast to come closest to the North Carolina coast around the Outer Banks, but then curve out into the Atlantic. Tropical storm Arthur currently has sustained winds of around 45 mph, with higher gusts, with tropical storm force winds extending out some 90 miles from the centre of the storm. The National Hurricane Center warns of tropical storm force winds for parts of the North Carolina coast, with how close Arthur eventually gets driving the strength of any wind gusts. In addition, rainfall of 1 to 3 inches is widely expected across parts of North Carolina, with isolated maximum amounts of 5 inches. Even if tropical storm Arthur came closer to shore, or made a landfall, it will not strengthen significantly before its closest pass to the North Carolina region it now seems. Arthur does not pose any real threat to insurance or reinsurance market interests at this time. But the storm is an early reminder of the season to come and will ensure reinsurance and insurance-linked securities (ILS) markets remain focused on the wind risk component of their renewals at this time of year."
other,"I will finish with an update on progress on regulatory reforms and supervisory actions to strengthen the financial system. In October, the Federal Reserve Board proposed a rule to strengthen the liquidity positions of large and internationally active financial institutions.1 Together with other federal agencies, the Board also issued a final rule implementing the Volcker rule, which prohibits banking firms from engaging in short-term proprietary trading of certain financial instruments.2 On the supervisory front, the next round of annual capital stress tests of the largest 30 bank holding companies is under way, and we expect to report results in March.Regulatory and supervisory actions, including those that are leading to substantial increases in capital and liquidity in the banking sector, are making our financial system more resilient. Still, important tasks lie ahead. In the near term, we expect to finalize the rules implementing enhanced prudential standards mandated by section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. We also are working to finalize the proposed rule strengthening the leverage ratio standards for U.S.-based, systemically important global banks. We expect to issue proposals for a risk-based capital surcharge for those banks as well as for a long-term debt requirement to help ensure that these organizations can be resolved. In addition, we are working to advance proposals on margins for noncleared derivatives, consistent with a new global framework, and are evaluating possible measures to address financial stability risks associated with short-term wholesale funding. We will continue to monitor for emerging risks, including watching carefully to see if the regulatory reforms work as intended.Since the financial crisis and the depths of the recession, substantial progress has been made in restoring the economy to health and in strengthening the financial system. Still, there is more to do. Too many Americans remain unemployed, inflation remains below our longer-run objective, and the work of making the financial system more robust has not yet been completed. I look forward to working with my colleagues and many others to carry out the important mission you have given the Federal Reserve."
other,"The Singapore economy will continue to expand, although at a slower and more sustainable pace after recovering robustly from the downturn.  At the same time, domestic cost pressures are rising, given the high level of resource utilisation in the economy and tight labour market in particular, as well as the diminishing boost from the cyclical uplift in productivity seen earlier this year.  Thus, the balance of risks is weighted towards inflation going forward.MAS will therefore continue with the policy of a modest and gradual appreciation of the S$NEER policy band in the period ahead.  However, the slope of the policy band will be increased slightly, with no change to the level at which the band is centred.  The policy band will at the same time be widened slightly in view of the volatility across international financial markets.  This policy stance will remain supportive of economic growth while seeking to cap CPI inflation at 2-3% in 2011 from 2.5-3.0% in 2010, and ensure medium-term price stability.  The MAS underlying inflation measure, which excludes the cost of accommodation and private road transport, is expected to average around 2% in 2010 and 2-3% next year."
drought,"Hundreds of millions of people could be left without access to water as climate breakdown causes Asia’s vast glaciers to shrink, researchers have found.
When the rains fail, glaciers in the high-mountain regions around the Himalayas are a life-saver, releasing 36 cubic kilometres of water _ the equivalent of 14 million Olympic swimming pools _ to drought-prone areas every summer.
Glacial loss in the region has been going on for a few decades. However, the rate has increased _ between 2000 and 2016, glaciers were shrinking 1.6 times faster than the period between 1951 to 2007.
“A lot of the climate projections suggest the melt will continue to accelerate,” lead researcher Dr Hamish Pritchard, a glaciologist from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), told The Independent.
Using climate projections, Dr Pritchard believes the glacier melt will start to slow in around 2050.
He added: “As we start to get drought stress hitting, there will be crop failures and a loss of livestock. It could cause people to migrate and if you can’t migrate, it might cause conflict as people will need to fight with their neighbours for food.”
This will hit areas such as the fertile Indus Valley, which has been inhabited by human civilisations for many thousands of years and today feeds 237 million people.
The increase in glacier melt is also causing a glut of water to come down, causing an increase in water consumption."
other,"In the business sector, profits continued to rise last year at a solid pace, boosted in part by continuing advances in productivity. Strong corporate balance sheets combined with expanding sales and favorable conditions in financial markets fostered a solid increase in spending on equipment and software last year. Investment in high-tech equipment rebounded, its increase spurred by further declines in the prices of high-tech goods. Expenditures for communications equipment, which had fallen off earlier this decade, showed particular strength for the year as a whole. In contrast, nonresidential construction activity remained soft.Although the financial condition of the business sector is generally quite strong, several areas of structural weakness are evident, notably in the automobile and airline industries. Despite these problems, however, favorable conditions in the business sector as a whole should encourage continued expansion of capital investment.For the most part, the financial situation of state and local governments has improved noticeably over the past couple of years. Rising personal and business incomes have buoyed tax revenues, affording some scope for increases in state and local government expenditures. At the federal level, the budget deficit narrowed appreciably in fiscal 2005. Outlays rose rapidly, but receipts climbed even more sharply as the economy expanded. However, defense expenditures, hurricane relief, and increasing entitlement costs seem likely to worsen the deficit in fiscal 2006."

wildfires,"Kangaroo Island is Australia’s third largest. Its glossy black cockatoos have been one of Australia’s conservation success stories. Thanks to a recovery program that began in 1995, their numbers in the wild increased from 150 to 400. Scientists responded by downgrading the birds’ status from critically endangered with extinction to just endangered.
But that all changed in January. Now this bird is part of an unfolding horror story.
Fires have raged across nearly 50 percent of Kangaroo Island. That’s their 4,400-square-kilometer (1,700-square-mile) isle off the coast of the state of South Australia. Flames destroyed the habitat for most of the birds. It’s unclear how many glossy black cockatoos survived. For those that did, food may now be scarce. These birds eat the seeds of a single tree species: the drooping she oak.
Many years of hard work to save these birds have gone up in smoke, says Daniella Teixeira. She’s a conservation biologist who works 2,184 kilometers (some 1,360 miles) away at Australia’s University of Queensland in Brisbane. This fire has brought “a big step backwards for the recovery team,” Teixeira concludes. And it’s something she understands well. She has studied and worked to protect these cockatoos for the last four years. Even if just one in every four of the birds died, she says, this subspecies could again be deemed critically endangered with extinction.
Similar stories are playing out across Australia. As of January 12, months of wildfires had burned nearly 11 million hectares (more than 42,470 square miles). That’s an area larger than the nation of Guatemala and a little bigger than the state of Tennessee. More than 2,200 homes have gone up in flames and 29 people died. And another two months of bush-fire season still remains. Already, the toll on animals and plants, many of which are unique — found nowhere outside Australia — boggles the mind."
other,"Since the MPC met in May 2020, global economic activity has remained fragile and in retrenchment in several geographies. While the uneasy and differently-paced withdrawal of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions in some countries enabled a sequential improvement in high frequency indicators during May-July, a renewed surge in COVID-19 infections in major economies and threats of a second wave of infections appear to have weakened these early signs of revival. Contractions in economic activity have been more severe in Q2:2020 than in Q1, and the near-term outlook points to a slow, uneven and hesitant recovery pushed into the second half of the year, with risks steeply slanted to the downside. Among advanced economies (AEs), output in the US and the Euro area underwent a deeper contraction in Q2:2020 than in the preceding quarter. Emerging market economies (EMEs) are expected to shrink in Q2 as reflected in high frequency indicators.Global financial markets have rebounded since end-March 2020 with intermittent pauses, shrugging off the volatility and sharp correction recorded in Q1:2020. Portfolio flows returned to EMEs in Q2 after a massive reversal, though there was moderation in July from the previous month¡¯s level. EME currencies have also appreciated in close co-movement, tracking weakening of the US dollar. Crude oil prices have remained supported on supply cuts by oil producing countries (OPEC plus) and improved demand prospects on the gradual easing of lockdown restrictions since May. Gold prices have rallied to an all-time high on August 5 on the back of safe haven demand. In AEs, benign fuel prices and soft aggregate demand have kept inflation subdued. In many EMEs, however, cost-push pressures arising from supply disruptions and demand revival have shown up in consumer prices in June 2020. Global food prices are elevated across the board."

Typhoon,"Tropical Storm Arthur Could Develop Off The East Coast This Weekend — 2 Weeks Before Hurricane Season Starts TOPLINE The National Hurricane Center says there is a 70% chance in the next five days, and a 40% chance in the next 48 hours, that the first official system in this year’s Atlantic hurricane season could develop off the U.S. East Coast — a full two weeks before the official start of a hurricane season forecasters show could be one of the most active in history. Clouds and thunderstorms currently moving between the Florida Keys and Cuba are “likely” to develop into a tropical or subtropical depression this weekend in the Atlantic Ocean and then move northeastward, according to the National Hurricane Center, though it is too early to tell exactly what the full impact could be on the East Coast. Should the system develop and sustained winds reach at least 39 mph, it would be given the name Arthur. The Atlantic hurricane season doesn’t officially start until June 1."
wildfires,"Fires have been raging through a ""unique, untouched pine forest"" on the Greek island of Evia as authorities fight to keep the flames under control.
Hundreds of people were evacuated from nearby villages as the fire broke out in the early hours of Tuesday and ravaged the dense forest.
""It's a huge ecological disaster,"" acting regional governor Kostas Bakoyannis told AFP.
More than 200 firefighters are helping to combat the blaze along with 75 fire engines, nine helicopters and seven planes, the news agency reports.
Italy and Spain have offered additional aircraft to help dump water on the forests, in an attempt to douse the flames on Greece's second-largest island.
Other wildfires broke out on the island of Thassos, as well as in the central region of Viotia and the Peloponnese. There was also a fire reported in Peania, a suburb of Athens.
Smoke has blanketed Athens, 110km (70 miles) from the island.
The fire broke out after a weekend that saw temperatures soaring near 40C (104F) with strong winds.
Newly-elected Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis cancelled his summer holiday plans and acknowledged that firefighters had ""given their all"" to tackle the flames, often with little sleep and food.
The regional governor, Costas Bakoyannis, told Skai TV the situation seemed to be improving after ""superhuman efforts"" to control the flames on Tuesday night.
The European Union's humanitarian commissioner, Christos Stylianides, said it ""remains difficult"", but suggested they might be able to ""to limit the ecological losses"".

The eruption of Mount Nyiragongo on Saturday night sent about 5,000 people fleeing from the city of Goma across the nearby border into Rwanda, while another 25,000 others sought refuge to the northwest in Sake, the U.N. children’s agency said Sunday. More than 170 children were still feared missing Sunday and UNICEF officials said they were organizing transit centers to help unaccompanied children in the wake of the disaster."
wildfires,"Alaska's heat wave is driving wildfires and melting glaciers, choking the state’s biggest cities with smoke and bloating rivers with meltwater.
In Anchorage, home to about 40 percent of Alaskans, the National Weather Service issued a dense smoke advisory on Sunday warning against prolonged outdoor activity, along with advisories for the elderly and the sick to stay indoors.
The culprit is the Swan Lake wildfire to the south in the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, which has burned since a June 5 lightning strike and consumed more than 68,000 acres, fire managers said.
To the north, in Fairbanks, fire officials ordered evacuations in two areas and told residents in a third to be prepared to leave because of the Shovel Creek Fire, which had grown to 5,568 acres by Sunday.
""People should GO, evacuate NOW. Leave immediately. DO NOT delay leaving,"" the evacuation order said. In all, there were 354 wildfires covering 443,211 acres in Alaska as of Sunday morning, according to state and federal fire managers.
Along with the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, which had multiple active fires, iconic spots with fires burning include Denali National Park and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Record warmth and near-record warmth in most of the state has created flammable conditions from the Canadian border in the east to the Bering Sea coast in the west.
Anchorage was one of the areas that saw record-breaking heat in June, which followed a record-warm spring for Alaska as a whole, said Rick Thoman, a Fairbanks-based climate scientist with the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy.
""This very warm weather, on top of the warm May, the very early snowmelt, then we had those two weeks of lightning strikes, it’s the classic setup,"" Thoman said.
Melting glaciers and mountain snowfields are bloating rivers and streams across a large swath of south central Alaska, the NWS said. The melt has brought water levels to flood stage at the Yentna River northwest of Anchorage on Sunday, said NWS forecaster Bob Clay."
wildfires,"On a dry October day this year, a stray lightning strike ignited a fire in Georgia’s Chattahoochee National Forest. The resulting wildfire, eventually stretching 11,000 hectares and burning for 6 weeks, marked an early start to the record-breaking fall fire season that the southeastern United States experienced this year. More than 50 major wildfires crawled through eight states, burned more than 40,000 hectares, and led to 14 deaths. The fires, which were more aggressive and more difficult to contain than usual, even produced smoke visible from space.
Now, with Appalachia’s wildfires fizzling out, fire scientists and fire managers are figuring out what they can learn from the conflagrations. In part, they hope to assemble data that might help them identify areas most at risk of dangerous fires, and encourage management practices—such as the use of prescribed burns—which could limit future outbreaks.
“We want to know how to move forward scientifically,” says Helen Mohr, a forester with the United States Forest Service (USFS) Southern Research Station who directs the Consortium of Appalachian Fire Managers and Scientists (CAFMS), based at Clemson University in South Carolina. “We want to inform scientists, managers, and communities how to keep their homes and forests safe.”
This fall’s wildfires were “really a perfect storm, so to speak,” says Donald Hagan, a forest ecologist at Clemson University. The blazes burned so quickly and out-of-control that counties in Kentucky, North Carolina, and Tennessee declared states of emergency and hundreds were hospitalized. One significant factor contributing to the fires’ speed and destruction is an extreme drought in the region, affecting states including Georgia, Tennessee, and North Carolina. That meant no rain to tamp down flames, and plenty of dry brush and wood that acted as fuel. In some areas, more than a century of fire suppression has allowed dead trees and other fuel to build up to dangerous levels, Hagan says. A lack of fire also allowed oily shrubs that burn easily, such as mountain laurel and rhododendron, to take over large swaths of forest. So when fires started, they tended to burn longer and spread more quickly, he says."
other,"The economic expansion in the United States gathered strength during 2003 while price inflation remained quite low. At the beginning of the year, uncertainties about the economic outlook and about the prospects of war in Iraq apparently weighed on spending decisions and extended the period of subpar economic performance that had begun more than two years earlier. However, with the support of stimulative monetary and fiscal policies, the nation's economy weathered that period of heightened uncertainty to post a marked acceleration in economic activity over the second half of 2003. Still, slack in resource utilization remained substantial, unit labor costs continued to decline as productivity surged, and core inflation moved lower. The performance of the economy last year further bolstered the case that the faster rate of increase in productivity, which began to emerge in the late 1990s, would persist. The combination of that favorable productivity trend and stimulative macroeconomic policies is likely to sustain robust economic expansion and low inflation in 2004."
other,"The exchange rate of the Indian rupee vis-¨¤-vis the US dollar has moved in both directions in recent months. Changing market perceptions about the pace and timing of monetary policy normalisation in the US, along with domestic inflation, fiscal slippage and current account balance developments, have been important factors driving exchange rate movements in the recent period and are likely to remain so in the near-term. With economic activity gathering pace in the euro area, uncertainty surrounding normalisation plans of the European Central Bank is likely to add to financial market volatility. The US macroeconomic policy mix _ easy fiscal policy in an environment when monetary accommodation is being withdrawn _ can accentuate market volatility. Assuming a depreciation of the Indian rupee by around 5 per cent relative to the baseline, inflation could edge higher by around 20 bps and the boost to net exports could increase growth by around 15 bps. On the other hand, with growth picking up in recent months, sound domestic fundamentals and the various initiatives taken by the Government to boost investment, India may continue to be an attractive destination for foreign investment, which could put upward pressures on the currency. An appreciation of the Indian rupee by 5 per cent in this scenario could soften inflation by around 20 bps and reduce growth by around 15 bps in 2018-19."
other,"In April 2015, MAS maintained the modest and gradual appreciation path of the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER) policy band, with no change to its slope, width and the level at which it was centred.  This policy stance, which has been in place since January 2015, was assessed to be appropriate in view of the moderate growth and inflation prospects.Following the Monetary Policy Statement (MPS) in April, the S$NEER appreciated amid a broad-based retraction in US$ strength.  Since July, however, the S$NEER has weakened and largely fluctuated in the lower half of the policy band.  This reflected renewed expectations of US monetary policy tightening and a rise in global risk aversion, mainly stemming from fears of a more significant downturn in China and other emerging market economies.  The three-month S$ SIBOR fell from 1.01% as at end-March 2015 to 0.82% by the end of June, before rising to 1.14% as at end-September 2015."
