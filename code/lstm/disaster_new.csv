1,"Deadly earthquake hits Indonesia: Dozens killed, hundreds injured","The earthquake unleashed dozens of aftershocks, some six kilometres northeast of the city of Majene,  causing heavy damage across the city, including to the five-story Mitra Manakarra Hospital where eight people were reportedly trapped inside.  
“The Governor’s office, two hotels, a mall, a community health centre, and over 300 houses also sustained damage”, said the spokesperson for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Jens Laerke. 
Local authorities have reported that 638 people have been injured and more than 18,000 have been temporarily displaced to 10 evacuation sites.  
However, these numbers are expected to increase as assessments continue.  
“The earthquake interrupted the access road between?Majene?and the provincial capital?Mamuju?in three different locations”, said Mr. Laerke.  
“Electricity, communications network and fuel supply have also been disrupted”, he added.
The OCHA spokesperson pointed out that the earthquake?followed?a 5.7 magnitude shock that rocked the same area on Thursday afternoon.? 
The chief of Indonesia’s Meteorology and Geophysics agency, Dwikorita Karnawati, warned that strong aftershocks could follow, telling a news conference that there had already been at least 26, after the two quakes had rocked the area, since Thursday afternoon. 
“The structures of the materials and rocks under the earth are unstable or weak after 28 tremors, and these may cause an underwater landslide and trigger a tsunami”, she said, recommending that people stay away from the coast if another strong quake strikes. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,Indonesia earthquake: dozens dead after tremors and landslides hit Sulawesi,"Thousands flee for safety and higher ground after island’s second quake in 24 hours
At least 37 people have been killed and hundreds injured following a strong earthquake that shook the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia early on Friday morning, prompting landslides and destroying houses.
Thousands of people fled their homes to seek safety when the 6.2-magnitude earthquake hit just after 1am local time on Friday morning. The epicentre was 6km north-east of Majene city in West Sulawesi.
Hundreds of buildings were destroyed or damaged, including a hospital, which collapsed with more than a dozen patients and staff trapped beneath it.
“The hospital is flattened,” said Arianto, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, from the rescue agency in Mamuju city, near Majene. Rescuers were also trying to reach a family of eight buried beneath the rubble of their destroyed home, he told AFP.
At least 37 people have been killed in Majene and Mamuju, and rescue workers fear the death toll will rise further. “Many of the dead are buried under rubble,” said Ali Rahman, the head of the local disaster mitigation agency in Mamuju. In Majene, 637 people were said to be injured.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More than 15,000 people have been temporarily displaced in 15 IDP sites, and figures are increasing.
The quake severely damaged buildings and houses, including a hospital that was completely flattened, trapping dozens of patients and staff in the rubble. Preliminary assessments indicate that 17 schools have been damaged.
Heavy rains in recent days have made access very difficult, blocking the main road to the affected areas.
The first priority is to search for survivors who have been trapped under the rubble, and to tend to the wounded.
This disaster comes nearly two and a half years after a massive earthquake and tsunami killed thousands in Central Sulawesi. Indonesia sits within the Pacific Ring of Fire, the world’s most disaster-prone area marked by floods, tsunamis and earthquakes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1,,"A strong earthquake has shaken central Chile, disrupting power and communications but causing no casualties or serious damage.
The quake had a magnitude of 7.1 and its epicentre was 70km (45 miles) northwest of Temuco with a depth of 25km, the US Geological Service said.
Hundreds of people in coastal areas fled to higher ground for fear of a tsunami, but no alert was issued.
An 8.8-magnitude quake in the same area last February caused huge destruction.
Chile's national emergency agency (Onemi) said there was no danger of a tsunami.
""Up until now we don't have any reports of injuries, there's no damage, just overloaded telephone lines and some partial power cuts,"" said Onemi's director, Vicente Nunez.
""We've told people to go back to their houses because there's no tsunami alert.""
The quake hit at 1720 (2020 GMT) and was centred about 600 kilometres (370 miles) southwest of the capital, Santiago.
The University of Chile's Institute of Seismology put the magnitude at 6.9.
Chile is still rebuilding after February's massive quake, which smashed infrastructure and triggered a tsunami that devastated several coastal towns, killing more than 400 people.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,,"A magnitude-6.8 offshore earthquake occurred in the South Pacific Ocean off central Chile at around 1839 Dec. 27. The epicenter was about 142 km (88 miles) northwest of Valdivia. The tremor occurred at a depth of about 10 km (6 miles), and moder-to-strong shaking was probably felt throughout central Chile. The quake likely damaged structures in nearby areas. Aftershocks are possible over the coming days.
Officials may temporarily shut down transportation infrastructure in the tremor zone to check for damage. Disruptions could occur during shutdowns. Utility outages are possible, particularly near the earthquake's epicenter. The event has not prompted any tsunami advisories.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,,"SANTIAGO, CHILE - A 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck Saturday off the coast of Antarctica, with authorities issuing a tsunami warning for Chile's Eduardo Frei base on the frigid continent, emergency officials said.
The quake struck at 8:36 p.m. local time (2336 GMT) about 210 kilometers east of the base at a depth of 10 kilometers, Chile's National Emergency Office (Onemi) said, urging evacuation from ""the beach area of the Antarctic"" ahead of a possible tsunami.
The Chilean air force's base is the country's largest in Antarctica and includes a village, hospital, school, bank, post office and chapel.
The maximum population in summer is 150 people, and the average population in winter is 80.
An unrelated 5.9-magnitude earthquake struck near Santiago on Saturday night, but Onemi said no significant damage or impact was reported.
Chile is one of the most seismically active countries in the world. An 8.8 magnitude temblor in Concepcion on February 27, 2010, left more than 500 dead.
The country suffered the most powerful earthquake ever recorded 60 years ago — measuring 9.6 magnitude — in Valdivia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,,"Early on Tuesday morning, a powerful magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck near the coast of Northern Chile. The first seismic activity recorded was located 48km from Huasco at 5.30am (UK time), according to US Geological Survey (USGS). Bolivia, Chile and Argentina were all affected.
The GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences reported that had been some damage and minor landslides but no apparent fatalities. Communities close to the coastline were evacuated, though fortunately, a tsunami was not triggered.
After the initial quake, aftershocks between magnitudes 5 and 6.1 were reported. Many more could be expected in the coming days, and even weeks. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no tsunami threat from the earthquake.
Chile's National Emergency Office of the Ministry of the Interior and Public Security said the event was unlikely to cause major disruption to services or infrastructure, though some places were disturbed. An image shared on social media shows a shaken supermarket after the event.
The quake was revealed to be at a depth of 10km (which equates to around 6.2 miles), and connected to underlying fault movement along a subduction zone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,,"An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 struck off southern Alaska's coast late Tuesday, shaking the Alaska Peninsula and briefly sparking tsunami concerns before officials said no destructive waves were coming.
The earthquake was centered in the Pacific Ocean about 60 miles southeast of Perryville on the sparsely populated Alaska Peninsula, striking around 10:12 p.m. local time (2:12 a.m. Wednesday ET).
The Alaska Peninsula protrudes from mainland Alaska and is flanked to the southwest by the Aleutian Islands.
Reports of significant damage, if any, weren't immediately available. A tsunami warning initially was issued for south Alaska and the Alaska Peninsula, but was canceled by early Wednesday, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The warning sent people to higher ground in cities like Sand Point, an island community of about 1,000 people off the peninsula, the Anchorage Daily News reported.
People in Sand Point gathered at a high school until shortly after midnight, when officials gave an all-clear, Jordan Keeler, an Anchorage-based city administrator, told the newspaper.
""The first wave didn't materialize, which is a great thing,"" Keeler, who was in contact with staff in Sand Point, told the Anchorage Daily News. No reports of major structural damage were made on the island, Keeler told the newspaper.
""We've canceled the (tsunami) advisories because it doesn't look like it's becoming a large wave or any larger,"" National Tsunami Warning Center Director James Gridley said, according to CNN affiliate KTUU.
Strong shaking was reported on the peninsula, the USGS said. Light to weak shaking was reported around Kodiak, about 300 miles northeast of the quake's center, and in Anchorage, some 530 miles from the center, according to the USGS.
In Kodiak, a city of about 6,000 people, a long line of cars headed up a mountain after residents learned of the tsunami warning late Tuesday, John Cannon told KTUU.
Police were ""trying to clear the lower areas down by the harbor,"" he said.
""You (could) hear the tsunami alarms. It's rather eerie,"" he told KTUU.
This quake's depth was 28 kilometers, or 17 miles, the USGS said -- relatively shallow.
""Anything below 70 kilometers is considered a shallow quake,"" CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar said. ""That's important, because shallow earthquakes often cause the most damage, compared to the ones that are deeper, regardless of the strength.""
More than 20 aftershocks followed the quake late Tuesday to early Wednesday, ranging from magnitudes of 2.8 to 6.1.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,,"CANBERRA, Australia -- A strong, deep earthquake shook inland Papua New Guinea on Friday, and officials said there were no immediate reports of casualties or major damage.
Shaking was felt in the capital Port Moresby but not strongly.
The U.S. Geological Survey said the 7.0 magnitude quake was 80 kilometers (53 miles) deep. Shallower quakes tend to cause more surface damage.
The epicenter was close to Morobe Patrol Post, with a population of 15,000 in Morobe province. Locals reported on social media the wharf at Morobe Patrol Post had “cracked in half.""
Some damage was reported on social media in coastal villages. Residents were advised to go inland if there were any sign of tidal changes or irregular ocean patterns.
Mark Maniaol, a hotel employee in Lae, the capital of Morobe and the country's second-largest city, said he left the quake but it was not severe. He was not aware of any damage in the city.
The Morobe Provincial Disaster Office Director Charley Masange said he did not expect to receive damage reports from the epicenter until Saturday.
“The epicenter is in the mountains. Not many people live there and it's very remote so it takes a long time to get information,” Manage said. “I'm not expecting major damage.”

Weak-to-light shaking was probably felt throughout Morobe Province, eastern sections of Eastern Highlands Province, southeastern areas of Madang Province, and western parts of Western New Britain Province. There have been no initial reports of damage or casualties as a result of the earthquake. It could take several hours until authorities can conduct comprehensive damage assessments, especially in remote areas. Aftershocks are possible over the coming days.
Officials may temporarily shut down transportation infrastructure in the tremor zone to check for damage. Minor disruptions could occur during shutdowns, but service will likely resume quickly if officials find no damage. Utility outages are possible, particularly near the earthquake's epicenter and coastal areas of affected provinces. Landslides are possible in mountain areas and could block roads, exacerbating ground transport disruptions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1,,"A strong 7.3-magnitude earthquake struck off Japan's east coast late Saturday, rattling the region hit by the powerful 2011 quake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown just weeks before the disaster's 10th anniversary.
The quake produced powerful shaking along parts of Japan's eastern coast, and was felt strongly in Tokyo, but triggered no tsunami alert.
Kyodo news agency reported at least 30 people injured, but gave no further details.
There were no immediate reports of significant damage, though local news broadcast images of a landslide on a highway.
Japan's meteorological agency said the quake hit at 11:08 pm (1408 GMT) at a depth of 60 kilometres (37 miles) in the Pacific off Fukushima -- near the epicentre of the 2011 killer quake which triggered a towering tsunami and killed more than 18,000 people.
The agency initially reported the strength of the quake as 7.1, but later revised the figure upwards. It said the quake was considered an aftershock of the massive 2011 temblor.
Aftershocks continued to rattle the region in the hours afterwards and officials cautioned local residents to be vigilant. A handful of people were reported to have sought shelter at evacuation centres.
""We are working quickly to collect information but we still have no details to announce. There were some unconfirmed reports about landslides but we are still checking,"" Mikihiro Meguro, an official from the Fukushima prefectural government, told AFP.
Around 950,000 homes lost power throughout the affected region, but no abnormalities were reported at the Fukushima nuclear plant, which melted down in the wake of the 2011 tsunami.
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga was called to his office, and broadcaster NHK said the government would set up a special liaison office to coordinate with affected regions.
""All messed up""
Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato addressed reporters after midnight and said evaluations were under way.
""As far as damage, casualties and structural damage are being assessed,"" he said, adding that sections of the bullet train had been suspended due to power outages.
""Surveys are being done at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant,"" he said.

1,,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- One of the biggest earthquakes to hit the South Pacific in modern history forced thousands of people in New Zealand to evacuate and triggered tsunami warnings across the world Friday, but it did not appear to cause injuries or major damage because it struck in remote ocean.
The magnitude 8.1 quake was the largest in a series of tremors that hit the region over several hours, including two earlier quakes that registered magnitude 7.4 and magnitude 7.3.
The earthquakes triggered warning systems and caused traffic jams and some chaos in New Zealand as people scrambled to get to higher ground, but their remoteness meant they did not appear to pose a widespread threat to lives or infrastructure.
The largest quake struck about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) off the coast of New Zealand. One of the earlier quakes hit much closer to New Zealand and awoke many people as they felt a long, rumbling shaking.
“Hope everyone is ok out there,” New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern wrote on Facebook during the night.
After the largest quake, civil defense authorities in New Zealand told people in some coastal areas to immediately get to higher ground. They said a damaging tsunami was possible, and waves could reach up to 3 meters (10 feet).
Emergency Management Minister Kiri Allan told reporters that people had followed the advisory.
“They felt the long or strong earthquakes and they knew to grab their bag and head into the highlands,” she said. “I can only thank and acknowledge the tireless efforts of the men and women from up and down the coast who knew how to act, when to act, and what to do.”
She warned that the threat could remain throughout much of the afternoon and people should not return home until authorities gave the all-clear. Allan said evacuations took precedence over coronavirus distancing measures.
The U.S. Tsunami Warning System also cautioned the quake could cause tsunami waves of up to 3 meters (10 feet) in Vanuatu and up to 1 meter (3 feet) in Australia, Fiji, French Polynesia and as far away as Mexico and Peru.
The U.S. Geological Survey said it was centered near the remote Kermadec Islands at a depth of 19 kilometers (12 miles).
The agency said in a report that the quake occurred at the intersection of the Pacific and Australia tectonic plates and eclipsed the largest quake previously recorded in the region, a magnitude 8.0 in 1976.
It said the interaction between the plates creates one of the most seismically active regions in the world, and it has recorded 215 quakes there above magnitude 6.0 over the past century.
Jennifer Eccles, an earthquake expert at the University of Auckland, said the quake was at the top end of the scale for those involving only the Earth's ocean crust.
“This is about as big as it gets,” she said.
She said most quakes larger than magnitude 8.0 tend to occur when a section of more robust continental crust is involved.
The U.S. Geological Survey said the magnitude 7.4 quake was likely a “foreshock” that contributed to the larger quake but that the first quake that hit closer to New Zealand was too far away in time and distance to have directly contributed.
Officials in New Zealand had hours earlier issued a tsunami warning for coastal areas after the first quake struck off its northeastern coast at about 2:30 a.m. Friday. There were no immediate reports of serious damage or casualties, and the warning was lifted just before the largest quake hit.
The U.S. Geological Survey said the first quake was centered at a depth of 21 kilometers (13 miles) under the ocean about 174 kilometers (108 miles) northeast of the city of Gisborne.
It was widely felt in New Zealand, and residents in the major cities of Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch reported being shaken awake.

1,,"AS SO often with earthquakes, this one started almost imperceptibly. It was lunchtime, and people in Tokyo are apt to take tremors lightly. It took just a frozen heartbeat, though, for that to change. One of us was seated at a coffee shop along a huge slab of oak that sat 14. It shook so violently, people raced outside. Another of us was next to a busy kitchen; metal pots shook, then crashed off the shelves, and with the noise diners came rushing up from tables in the basement and out into the streets. Within minutes, Tokyo's narrow alleys were choked with people, some visibly shocked, most eerily quiet, listening to the clanking power lines overhead, and quite understandably bereft without mobile-phone signals. As I walked onto one of the shopping boulevards of Omote-Sando, a sea of evacuees from the buildings that run along it let out a roar of fear when a second—and then a third—aftershock hit. As cars swayed, and trees lurched overhead, you could feel the power of the beast writhing underneath Japan.
The country has long prepared for something like this—and it showed. Friends quickly offered advice. Stay in open spaces; when back at home, fill up your bath and your rice cooker, so that there is plenty of food and water in reserve. Though phone signals were mostly dead (apparently to leave bandwidth for emergency services), the internet functioned. That meant e-mail and Skype worked, and Facebook and Twitter conveyed news, tips and just the sort of offbeat information that is uplifting in the face of adversity (according to one Facebook rumour, this being Japan, airlines are generously offering cheap flights for anyone wanting to leave the country).

Despite what may be the world's most intensive effort to map faults and assess risks by a notoriously earthquake-prone and earthquake-conscious nation, such a strong quake was not anticipated for the region, says University of Tokyo geophysicist Robert Geller.
The earthquake occurred 130 kilometers east of Sendai and 373 kilometers northeast of Tokyo, along or very near the boundary between two tectonic plates, where the Pacific plate is being drawn under the Japanese islands. Movement along plate boundaries is known to be capable of producing major earthquakes. And Japan's latest national seismic risk map gave a 99% chance of a magnitude-7.5 or greater quake occurring in that area in the next 30 years, Geller says.
Although today's quake technically satisfies that prediction, the logarithmic scale used for measuring the power of earthquakes means that a magnitude-8.9 earthquake releases well over 100 times more energy than does a magnitude-7.5 quake.

The earthquake’s epicentre was near Lyttelton, just 10 km south-east of Christchurch’s central business district. It occurred nearly six months after the 4 September 2010 earthquake.
The earthquake struck at lunchtime, when many people were on the city streets. More than 130 people lost their lives in the collapse of the Canterbury Television and Pyne Gould Corporation buildings. Falling bricks and masonry killed another 11 people, while eight died in two city buses that were crushed by crumbling walls. Rock cliffs collapsed in the Sumner and Redcliffs area, and boulders tumbled down the Port Hills, with five people killed by falling rocks.
Although not as powerful as the magnitude 7.1 earthquake on 4 September 2010, this earthquake occurred on a shallow fault line close to the city, so the shaking was particularly destructive.
The earthquake brought down many buildings damaged the previous September, especially older brick and mortar buildings. Heritage buildings that suffered heavy damage included the Provincial Council Chambers, Lyttelton’s Timeball Station, the Anglican Christchurch Cathedral and the Catholic Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament. Two-thirds of the buildings in the central business district were subsequently demolished, including the city’s tallest building, the Hotel Grand Chancellor.
Liquefaction was much more extensive than in September 2010. Shaking turned water-saturated layers of sand and silt beneath the surface into sludge that squirted upwards through cracks. Thick layers of silt covered properties and streets, and water and sewage from broken pipes flooded streets. House foundations cracked and buckled, wrecking many homes. Irreparable damage necessitated the demolition of several thousand homes, and large tracts of suburban land were subsequently abandoned, with 8,000 properties bought by the government and razed.",https://nzhistory.govt.nz/page/christchurch-earthquake-kills-185,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There’s a slim chance Nuri could strengthen into a typhoon — winds of at least 74 mph, like an Atlantic hurricane.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"Hurricane Iota Makes Landfall In Nicaragua, Region Braces For 'Catastrophic' Impact","Hurricane Iota has made landfall in Nicaragua as a Category 4 storm, with the Central American region bracing for the possibility of catastrophic damage.
Iota crossed into Nicaragua near the town of Haulover, approximately 15 miles south of where Hurricane Eta also struck as a Category 4 on Nov. 3.
Nicaragua, along with Honduras, Guatemala, and southern Belize, which are flanked by the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean, are still trying to recover from the widespread devastation caused by Hurricane Eta, which left tens of thousands homeless.
At the time, Eta was the strongest storm to ever hit Nicaragua in the month of November.
The National Hurricane Center has warned of ""catastrophic winds, life-threatening storm surge, and torrential rainfall"" across Central America from the latest storm.
When it made landfall, Iota had sustained winds of 155 mph – a Category 4 hurricane, but by 4 a.m. ET, it had lost strength, becoming a Category 2 storm, with winds at 105 mph, according to the U.S.-based National Hurricane Center. The storm was centered about 10 miles east-northeast of El Pia, Nicaragua. Before making landfall, Iota reached Category 5 for a time.
Besides Iota's incredible strong winds — expected to rip apart roofs and shatter some buildings completely — it is also bringing a massive storm surge, rain and flooding. Water is always the biggest killer in any tropical event and this will be no exception; Iota is a ""bigger"" storm than Eta in terms of how wide the windfield is. That means more people will feel the effects of the storm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,Hurricane Iota Now a ‘Catastrophic’ Category 5 Storm,"U.S. forecasters say Hurricane Iota has strengthened to a catastrophic Category 5 storm as it nears landfall with Nicaragua.
In its latest report, the National Hurricane Center says Iota is closing in on Nicaragua, where it is expected to bring “catastrophic winds, life-threatening storm surge, and torrential rainfall.”
Iota, currently packing maximum sustained winds of 260 kilometers per hour, is expected to make landfall in almost the exact location where Hurricane Eta came ashore two weeks ago.
Authorities in Honduras and Nicaragua rushed to evacuate their respective citizens from coastal areas Monday ahead of the storm.
""What's drawing closer is a bomb,"" Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez said at a news conference alongside Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei.
Hurricane Eta killed at least 50 people, destroyed buildings, knocked out power and caused flooding and landslides.
Iota is the record-breaking 30th named storm of the 2020 hurricane season. Along with Eta, it marks the first time that two major hurricanes have formed in the month of November.
It is also the 10th named storm to strengthen by more than 55.5 kph in a 24-hour period. Meteorologists attribute the effect to warm waters in the southern Caribbean.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,Hurricane Laura: Most dangerous hurricane to hit the US this season,"While it is difficult to link any individual tropical cyclone to climate change, the UN World Meteorological Organization (WMO) expects to see more powerful storms in future as a result of global warming. 
Laura is the seventh named storm to landfall in the US this season, which has just begun what is traditionally its most intense period. It intensified within 24 hours from a Category 1 to a strong Category 4 on the Saffir Simson hurricane scale.
According to news reports, some 1,500 people are being sent into Louisiana for rescue and clean up missions, including troops from the National Guard. 
Winds of up to 150 mph caused severe damage, including the death of at least six people, and left half a million homes without power.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards tweeted that the hurricane has left roads flooded and wildlife displaced, warning people to stay vigilant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,Hurricane Laura death toll climbs to 14 in the US,"Fourteen people are now confirmed dead in the United States after Hurricane Laura battered southern states.
Ten of the victims were in Louisiana and four in Texas.
Winds of up to 150mph (240km/h) caused severe damage, with power cuts to more than half a million homes and a chemical fire from an industrial plant.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards has asked the federal government for immediate financial assistance in dealing with the fallout.
President Donald Trump will travel to the two states on Saturday to meet with people affected by the hurricane, the White House said.
Laura has now been downgraded to tropical storm status, but heavy rain is still falling on several states.
In Haiti, which was earlier badly hit by storms Marco and Laura, at least 31 people are now reported to have died",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,Unsurvivable surge': Laura makes landfall on Texas-Louisiana border,"Galveston, Texas: Hurricane Laura made landfall near Cameron in Louisiana on Thursday afternoon (AEST) as one of the region's worst hurricanes, threatening to devastate the US Gulf Coast with catastrophic storm surges, flash floods and powerful winds that could leave areas uninhabitable for weeks or months.
It came ashore as a category four storm with maximum winds of about 240km/h, according to the National Hurricane Centre. Laura is strong enough to rip down houses, uproot trees and cause power outages that could last weeks or even months.The storm is set to push a wall of water more than 6.1 metres high in some places on to shore, with potentially deadly effects - a catastrophic surge the centre earlier described as ""unsurvivable"".
It could inflict more than US15 billion (20 billion) in insured losses.
It is just a few kilometres per hour short of the most powerful storm category possible, and it's matching the previous record-breaker, the Lost Island Hurricane of 1856.
Some additional strengthening is possible before Laura reaches the north-west US Gulf of Mexico coast, the centre said. It's coming with more power than Hurricane Harvey when it made landfall in Texas in 2017.

2,,"Thick mud and debris coated many villages around the Philippine capital on Friday after a typhoon killed at least 42 people and caused extensive flooding that sent people fleeing to their roofs, officials said.
Troops, police, coast guard and disaster-response teams rescued tens of thousands of people, including many who flooded radio and TV networks and social media with desperate pleas for help.
Floodwaters receded and the weather cleared in many areas after Typhoon Vamco blew out into the South China Sea on Friday, but the military said it was still rescuing people trapped in some flooded communities.
Amphibious assault vehicles usually used in counter-insurgency operations were deployed for the rescue work, military chief of staff Gen. Gilbert Gapay said in a meeting with disaster-response officials.
“We’ll continue to look for the missing, help in damage assessment,” Gapay said.
The national police reported that the death toll had risen to at least 42 with 20 missing. The government’s main disaster-response agency, which waits for provincial reports and follows a laborious process of verifying casualties, reported a much lower death count, causing confusion.
Among the dead were at least 12 villagers who were dug out from mud and rockslides in the northern provinces of Cagayan and Nueva Vizcaya, police said.
After slamming into northeastern Quezon province, Vamco gained strength with sustained winds of 155 kilometers (96 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 255 kph (158 mph). It blew north of metropolitan Manila overnight Wednesday, toppling trees and power poles, swelling rivers, flooding residential communities and setting off landslides and storm surges.
In hard-hit Marikina city in the capital region and the towns of Rodriguez and Cainta in nearby Rizal province, several villages were inundated by water that reached the second and third floors of many houses, prompting hundreds of residents to flee to their roofs and call TV and radio networks or post desperate messages on social media. The panic was exacerbated by widespread power outages and loss of internet access.
Videos of Marikina showed a thick coat of muddy water covering roads and staining houses and cars. Residents carried appliances and furniture from their homes and used pails and shovels to remove the mud after the water receded.
In a televised meeting of Cabinet and disaster-response officials Friday, a reporter asked where President Rodrigo Duterte was, prompting an annoyed response from his spokesman.",https://apnews.com/article/floods-typhoons-typhoon-vamco-philippines-manila-4fd174fa6aa35c7d98fe4b1700e11ddc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,,"A typhoon swelled rivers and flooded low-lying areas as it passed over the storm-battered northeastern Philippines, leaving at least 13 people dead and 15 others missing, officials said Thursday.
The Philippine National Police reported the casualty figures, but gave no details.
Typhoon Vamco passed north of Manila between Bulacan and Pampanga provinces, toppling trees and knocking out power. Officials said earlier that nearly 200,000 people had been evacuated, some forcibly, from vulnerable coastal and low-lying areas.
Officials said about 1.9 million households were without power in Metro Manila and nearby provinces. Many electricity poles were toppled, power lines were knocked down and power transformers were damaged.
President Rodrigo Duterte took a break from an online summit of Southeast Asian leaders to fly by helicopter over the affected areas.
“As president I guarantee you that your government will do its best to provide assistance in the form of shelters, relief goods, financial aid and post-disaster counseling. Rest assured, the government will not leave anybody behind. We will get through this crisis,” Duterte said in a televised address.
Rescue teams were deployed to flooded areas in Rizal province, coast guard chief Adm. George Ursabia told DZBB radio.
Marikina city Mayor Marcie Teodoro said fierce winds knocked down power lines overnight, leaving many areas without power and internet service. Heavy rains also flooded many areas and the Marikina River was swollen. Many people in Marikina city were waiting to be rescued from roofs.
“There are many areas that historically don’t get flooded but now they are swamped, like city hall,” he told DZBB radio.
Mark Timbal, spokesman for the government’s disaster response agency, said 363 rescue teams had been deployed consisting of 1,000 rescuers with at least 40 rubber boats.
The typhoon had maximum sustained winds of 130 kilometers per hour (80 mph) with stronger gusts Thursday morning. It was moving west-northwest at 30 kph (19 mph) and was headed for the South China Sea.
The government’s main disaster-response agency had pleaded to the media to relay typhoon alerts in northeastern areas devastated by an earlier typhoon, Goni, saying the agency’s messages could not be sent by cellphones due to damaged telecommunications systems.
Goni, one of the strongest typhoons in the world this year, left more than 30 people dead or missing and damaged or destroyed more than 270,000 houses, many in coastal villages. Tens of thousands of people remain displaced.
The Philippines is hit by about 20 typhoons and tropical storms each year.

2,,"At least 20 people were killed as Typhoon Goni lashed the Philippines over the weekend, and about 13,000 shanties and houses were damaged or swept away in the eastern island province that was first hit by the ferocious storm, officials said Monday.
Goni blasted into Catanduanes province at dawn Sunday as a super typhoon with sustained winds of 225 kilometers (140 miles) per hour and gusts of 280 kph (174 mph). But it weakened considerably after making landfall and shifted direction to spare the capital, Manila, before blowing out into the South China Sea.
The Office of Civil Defense said at least 20 people were killed in Catanduanes and nearby Albay province.
Catanduanes, an island province of more than 260,000 people that is often lashed by Pacific storms, was isolated after losing power and communications due to Goni and another typhoon that had hit a week earlier. But officials there managed to connect to the outside world on Monday after disaster-response authorities flew to the devastated island with satellite phones.
Catanduanes Gov. Joseph Cua and other officials said the typhoon whipped up 5-meter (16-foot) storm surges and damaged or swept away about 13,000 houses. Many residents fled to safety from their homes as the typhoon approached.
More than 66,000 other houses and huts were damaged elsewhere in the region, officials said.
Cua described the onslaught as “severe” and reported that some coastal areas were swamped by frightening storm surges.
About 80% of the electricity posts on the island were toppled and roads linking the province’s 11 towns remained impassable, Cua said.
An army general on the island appealed for more troops to help distribute food packs and water to residents. He added that the army camp was destroyed by the typhoon and soldiers have camped out at the airport, which remained open.
An air force cargo plane was to deliver food packs, drinking water, blankets and other relief goods to the province.
The typhoon also devastated the nearby province of Albay, where heavy rains washed down boulders and mudflows from Mayon Volcano, engulfing about 150 houses in a single community in the town of Guinobatan, Albay Gov. Al Francis Bichara said.",https://apnews.com/article/typhoons-south-china-sea-philippines-storms-typhoon-goni-90748529b120afdab9b041d64af1f043,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,,"A super typhoon blew into the eastern Philippines with disastrous force Sunday, killing at least 10 people and triggering volcanic mudflows that engulfed about 150 houses before weakening as it blew away from the country, officials said.
Typhoon Goni blasted into the eastern island province of Catanduanes at dawn from the Pacific with sustained winds of 225 kilometers (140 miles) per hour and gusts of 280 kph (174 mph), threatening some provinces still recovering from a deadly typhoon that hit a week ago.
Goni barreled through densely populated regions and threatened to sideswipe Manila, which shut down its main airport, but shifted southward Sunday night and spared the capital, the government weather agency said.
At least nine people were killed in the hard-hit province of Albay, including a father and son. Villagers fled to safety as the typhoon approached, but the two apparently stayed put in the community in Guinobatan town where about 150 houses were inundated by volcanic mudflow.
“The child was found 15 kilometers (9 miles) away,” Albay Gov. Al Francis Bichara told DZMM radio, adding that the boy was swept away by mudflows and found in the next town.
He did not say whether there were any other residents trapped by the rampaging mudflows in the community and added that downed communications made it hard for people to communicate. The Office of Civil Defense reported that three Guinobatan residents were missing, but it was not immediately clear if they were from the mudflow-hit community.
The other deaths in Albay included a villager who was pinned by a fallen tree. One person was killed in Catanduanes province.

Ricardo Jalad, who heads the government’s disaster-response agency, had feared that the typhoon could wreak major damage due to its enormous force. The Philippine weather agency reinforced those concerns, saying that within 12 hours after the typhoon’s landfall, people could face “catastrophic, violent winds and intense to torrential rainfall.”
Residents were warned of possible landslides, massive flooding, storm surges of up to 5 meters (16 feet) and powerful winds that can blow away shanties. But after hitting a mountain range and repeatedly slamming into coastal provinces, the typhoon gradually weakened, although it remained potentially deadly as it blew out into the South China Sea, forecasters said.
One of the most powerful typhoons in the world this year, Goni evoked memories of Typhoon Haiyan, which left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million in the central Philippines in November 2013.",https://apnews.com/article/typhoon-goni-typhoons-weather-philippines-manila-a67059837bae9f3f4d68adf69c1fe66f,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alerts for strong winds, waves, high tides, rainfall and lightning were issued for Amami Oshima alongside evacuation orders.
There were no immediate reports of any injuries in Okinawa, home to more than half of the roughly 50,000 U.S. troops based in Japan under a bilateral treaty.

2,,"Hurricane Delta, which made landfall about 11 miles (about 18 kilometers) from where the devastating Hurricane Laura hit a little more than a month earlier, cost 2.9 billion in the United States and was linked to six deaths in the U.S. and Mexico, according to a report from the National Hurricane Center.
The report released Tuesday details the hurricane’s origins, trajectory and things such as wind speed and storm surge when it made landfall in southwestern Louisiana.
The Center releases similar reports on every named storm that hits during a season. The reports on some of the 2020 season’s most devastating hurricanes - including Laura, Iota and Zeta - have yet to be published.
In the United States, two people died as a direct result of Delta — a 19-year-old woman and a 49-year-old man who both drowned in rip currents near Destin, Florida — and there were two indirect deaths associated with electrocutions and fires. In Mexico, there were two indirect deaths — an electrocution and a fall — linked to the hurricane.
The Center classifies deaths as direct or indirect. Direct deaths are those considered directly tied to the storm such as drowning in storm surge or being in a house that collapses from wind. Someone who dies of a heart attack during a storm or is electrocuted by a downed power line, for example, is considered an indirect death.
The hurricane came ashore as a Category 2 storm with winds of 97 miles per hour (156 miles per hour) and produced a storm surge that got up to nine feet (2.7 meters) in some areas east of where it made landfall near Creole, the report said. While Laura’s earlier damage came through devastating winds, Delta produced huge rain totals in some areas particularly between Lake Charles and Alexandria. Nearly 18 inches of rain fell in LeBleu Settlement northeast of Lake Charles, the report said.
The Center also released a report Tuesday on Hurricane Marco. That storm, which came days before the much more destructive Laura made landfall on August 27, was originally thought to have made landfall at the mouth of the Mississippi River on Aug. 24 based on satellite imagery. But in the report, the Center said further research suggests it stayed just south and did not actually make landfall. There were no reports of casualties linked to the storm and only minor damage.
The 2020 Atlantic hurricane season set multiple records while producing a record 30 named storms. There were so many that the list of 21 conventional names was exhausted and the Greek alphabet was used for only the second time.

Iota had intensified into an extremely dangerous Category 5 storm early in the day, but the U.S. National Hurricane Center said it weakened slightly to Category 4, with maximum sustained winds of 155 mph (250 kph). Its center made landfall about 30 miles (45 kilometers) south of the Nicaraguan city of Puerto Cabezas, also known as Bilwi.
Iota already had been hitting the Caribbean coasts of Nicaragua and Honduras with torrential rains and strong winds.
Iota came ashore just 15 miles (25 kilometers) south of where Hurricane Eta made landfall Nov. 3, also as a Category 4 storm. Eta’s torrential rains saturated the soil in the region, leaving it prone to new landslides and floods, and that the storm surge could reach 15 to 20 feet (4.5 to 6 meters) above normal tides.
In Bilwi, business owner Adán Artola Schultz braced himself in the doorway of his house as strong gusts of wind and rain drover water in torrents down the street. He watched in amazement as wind ripped away the metal roof structure from a substantial two-story home and blew it away like paper.
“It is like bullets,” he said of the sound of metal structures banging and buckling in the wind. “This is double destruction,” he said, referring to the damages wrought by Eta just 12 days earlier.
“This is coming in with fury,” said Artola Schultz.

It will move between the Azores and the Canary Islands towards Madeira this weekend, bringing a high chance of wet and windy conditions, before potentially hitting England, Wales and southern Ireland early next week.
It is the 29th named storm of the hurricane season, meaning that 2020 has now broken the old record of 28 named storms in 2005. Meteorologists say another could strike in the Caribbean in the coming days.
So far, storm Theta has maximum sustained winds of 50 MPH (85KM/H), but forecasters say it may strengthen slightly in the next 12 to 24 hours.
If Theta continues on its predicted trajectory, it will be felt most strongly across the Bay of Biscay, the La Manche region and throughout England and Wales, bringing with it the possibility of severe winds and heavy rains.
However, there are currently no coastal watches or warnings in effect; it’s still unclear whether the centre of the storm will hit land.
Cyclones within the Atlantic ocean become known as “tropical storms” and receive a name, when their wind speeds exceed 39 MPH. Only if the wind speed exceeds 75 MPH, do they become known as “hurricanes”. 
Tropical storms like Theta are a relatively rare occurrence in Europe, but 2020’s extreme season has seen storms hitting Western parts of Europe with increased frequency and bringing regional flooding, winds and damage.

Ripping tarps from already damaged roofs and scattering debris piled by roadsides, Hurricane Delta inflicted a new round of destruction on Louisiana as it struck communities still reeling after Hurricane Laura took a similar path just six weeks earlier.
Delta hit as a Category 2 hurricane, with top winds of 100 mph (155 kph) but rapidly grew weaker. It dwindled within hours to a weak Category 1 storm with 75 mph (120 kph) winds. Still, forecasters warned of danger from storm surge and flash floods across much of southwestern Louisiana and parts of neighboring Texas.
Delta made landfall Friday evening near the coastal town of Creole — a distance of only about 15 miles (24 kilometers) from where Laura struck land in August, killing 27 people in Louisiana. The earlier storm damaged nearly every home and building in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Piles of moldy mattresses, sawed-up trees and other debris still lined the streets.
Mayor Nic Hunter said tarps were flying off homes across the city.
“I’m in a building right now with a tarp on it and just the sound of the tarp flapping on the building sounds like someone pounding with a sledgehammer on top of the building,“ Hunter said as he rode out the storm downtown. ”It’s pretty intense.”

Jack said the tarp cover the roof damage caused by Laura hadn’t blown off. His windows were covered to protect against flying debris.

2,,"Another busy hurricane season appears likely, although it won’t be as bad as last year, according to a prediction released Wednesday by AccuWeather, a private weather forecasting service.
The prediction calls for seven to 10 hurricanes. Three to five of these are expected to reach major hurricane strength, which means winds of at least 111 mph.
“Current indications are this will be another above-normal season,” said Dan Kottlowski, AccuWeather’s lead hurricane forecaster. “This can translate into high impacts on the United States.”
The season still is unlikely to be as busy as last year’s record-breaking season, which generated 30 storms, including 13 hurricanes, subjecting the United States to 12 direct hits and exhausting the storm names selected for that year.
But the danger to the U.S. east coast may be higher this year because of the weakening of the Bermuda high, a high-pressure zone that last year stiff-armed many storms into the Gulf of Mexico. This year, the Bermuda high’s rim could be farther northeast, allowing storms to curve north earlier and strike the east coast.
The Accu-Weather forecast cited warm Atlantic temperatures as one factor in the prediction of an active season.

For now, the main focus is across the western North Pacific Ocean where a super typhoon has its eyes set for parts of South Korea and the Japanese island of Okinawa. The good news about Super Typhoon Sanba is that it will likely gradually weaken as it pushes to the north. However, the storm will likely pack a punch across South Korea.
Sanba, which was the 17th tropical depression to form in the western North Pacific Ocean developed on September 11, 2012. Within two days, Sanba hit ideal conditions to strengthen into a Category 5 hurricane, which we call a “Super Typhoon” in the western Pacific. “Super-typhoon” is a term utilized by the U.S. Joint Typhoon Warning Center for typhoons that reach maximum sustained 1-minute surface winds around 130 knots or 150 miles per hour. If you compare this to the Saffir-Simpson scale, it would be a very strong category 4 or 5 hurricane in the Atlantic basin. Yesterday, Sanba moved over very warm waters and was able to develop maximum sustained winds of 175 mph with gusts approximately around 200 mph. Just as a reference to give you an idea how strong Sanba truly is, an EF-4 tornado has sustained winds around 168-199 mph.

3,Australian wildfires declared among the 'worst wildlife disasters in modern history',"Nearly 3 billion animals were affected by Australia's worst wildfire season that burned from last July through March, scientists announced Tuesday — a figure almost three times higher than original estimates.
The report released Tuesday and commissioned by the World Wide Fund for Nature Australia said more than 46 million acres were scorched. An estimate in January said 1.25 billion animals were affected.
""This ranks as one of the worst wildlife disasters in modern history,” Dermot O’Gorman, the organization's chief executive officer, said in a statement. ""It’s hard to think of another event anywhere in the world in living memory that has killed or displaced that many animals.""
Ten researchers from Australian universities and wildlife groups involved in the report have been looking at both the impact of the fires and the possible ways to protect ecosystems in the future.
The affected wildlife includes 143 million mammals, 2.46 billion reptiles, 180 million birds and 51 million frogs.
""It's almost impossible to comprehend how many individuals that actually means,"" Lily van Eeden, a researcher at the University of Sydney and a co-author of the report, told NBC News.
The jump in the estimated animals affected compared to the January report is due to a wider geographic area being studied and new data on wildlife, she said.
Despite the increased scope of the research, Van Eeden cautioned, the estimate is still ""quite conservative.""
Invertebrate species — such as spiders and butterflies — were not included and neither was a range of wildlife that lives in waterways like turtles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,Wildfires: Australia needs national monitoring agency,"Just before the COVID-19 pandemic, bush fires in Australia destroyed more than 3,000 homes and burnt millions of hectares of vegetation. The crisis exposed the nation’s fire monitoring system as being unfit for purpose. Precise real-time information about the area burnt and the intensity of the fires was not available when it was needed.
Australia does not have a central system for gathering and storing essential information about bush fires. State and territory governments, and even agencies within states, have different approaches. This worked fine when fires were smaller. But those in the 2019–20 season crossed multiple state borders.
The blazes engulfed a huge geographic range and burnt for a duration and intensity that was beyond the experience of communities and fire managers1. Many Australians endured five months of smoke pollution that breached national air-quality standards. Usually, people would experience shorter bouts covering smaller areas2.
The extraordinary scale and intensity of the fires were driven by climate conditions not seen in a century: three years of drought, including three consecutive, anomalously dry winters3. This weather is consistent with predictions that global warming will result in conditions that increase the risk of fire4,5. Studies have linked extreme bush-fire seasons over the past few years to anthropogenic climate change
Debate over the cause of the bush fires became politically charged. Fire scientists and managers had to stem misinformation from politicians and the media suggesting that the fires were not unusual historically and were not linked to climate change. There were even suggestions that the fires were the result of arson, or of inappropriate land management8–10. Staggering environmental consequences were claimed, including greenhouse-gas emissions that were exceeded only by those in China, the United States, India, Russia and Japan, and the loss or displacement of more than one billion native vertebrates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the fire season began months ago during the southern hemisphere winter, 23 people have died. With six people missing in Victoria state, the authorities fear the death toll will rise. Among the fatalities are volunteer firefighters, including a young man who died when his 10-tonne truck was flipped over in what officials have described as a ""fire tornado"".

Although recent cooler conditions and rain have brought some respite, more than 50 fires are still burning in the states of New South Wales and Victoria.
Hot and windy conditions are forecast to return to many parts of New South Wales this weekend and authorities in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) have declared a state of emergency as massive bushfires rage south of Canberra.

3,California's wildfire hell: how 2020 became the state's worst ever fire season,"Impossibly fast and ferocious blazes burned a staggering 4.1m acres, making for an‘astonishing and horrifying’ year
On a deadly 24-hour march through the Sierra Nevada in September, the flames of what would become the North Complex fire raced through more than 200,000 acres of dense timber, destroyed a historic schoolhouse and overtook a beloved camp for children with cancer.
Also in its path was the remote settlement of Berry Creek, where Daniel Salazar, 27, found himself once again facing an unprecedented, out of control blaze. Less than two years earlier, Salazar had escaped the Camp fire, which killed his grandparents and 83 others in and around the town of Paradise.
In the Sierra Nevada and across California in late summer and early fall this year, firefighters and residents fought a losing battle against impossibly fast and ferocious blazes.
It was the state’s worst wildfire season on record. By the end of it, the flames had killed 31 people, destroyed or damaged more than 10,000 buildings and burned a staggering 4.1m acres. The North Complex fire was responsible for more than 300,000 acres of scorched land, killing 16 people in its wake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,"California's Wildfires Have Become Bigger, Deadlier, and More Costly. Here's Why","Large wildfires raging throughout California have claimed at least 44 lives statewide, destroyed thousands of structures and prompted hundreds of thousands to evacuate. A fire actively burning in Northern California took at least 42 lives, becoming the deadliest fire on state record.
Large fires have scorched populated areas of California over the past week, including the Camp Fire, north of Sacramento, which incinerated the entire town of Paradise, and the Woolsey Fire, which burns northwest of Los Angeles. Firefighters on Monday also battled the Rocky Peak fire, which sprung up near where the Woolsey fire began and forced the shutdown of the Route 118 freeway. The Camp Fire has become one of California’s most destructive fires in at least a century, according to the Associated Press.
Wildfires are a natural and annual occurrence in California, typically appearing toward the end of the long, dry summers. In four out of five cases, people provide the igniting spark. At the same time, the environment has also become more flammable. As the state grows hotter and increasingly subject to prolonged droughts, and as more people live in high risk areas, the fires simply get bigger, more severe and more costly to put out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,,"A giant bushfire on the edge of Sydney, which has blanketed the city in smoke causing a spike in respiratory illnesses and the cancellation of outdoor sports, will take weeks to control but will not be extinguished without heavy rains, firefighters said.
Thousands of weary firefighters, who have been battling wildfires for a month, have been fighting nearly 100 blazes in New South Wales state.
The mega fire north of Sydney, Australia‘s largest city, was created on Friday when several fires merged and was now burning across 335,000 hectares.
“We need flooding rain to put these fires out. That’s really what is going to stop it,” said the New South Wales Rural Fire Service. “These will take many weeks to put out.”
Wildfires are common in Australia during the hot summer, which begins in December, but this year the fires started much earlier, blamed on soaring temperatures, dry winds and arson.
A three-year drought has left much of Australia tinder dry.
The fires around Sydney have been pumping such vast amounts of smoke into the air that they appear as significant rain on the radars, the Bureau of Meteorology said on Twitter.
New South Wales Health said late on Friday that some 1,140 people had sought medical assistance for breathing issues or asthma in the past week – a quarter more than in a typical week. NSW Ambulance fielded about a third more calls.
Six people have been killed, nearly 700 houses burnt down and millions of hectares of land razed.

3,,"A massive brushfire, the worst in Israel’s history, raged unchecked for more than eight hours Thursday, burning thousands of acres of land, forcing villages to evacuate, and killing up to 40 people when their bus was engulfed in flames. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the blaze as “a catastrophe, the likes of which we have not yet known”.
He appealed to Russia, Cyprus, Greece and Italy for help in putting out the fire, which began on the slopes of the Carmel hill, southeast of Israel’s port city of Haifa, and rapidly spread.
Cyprus and Greece agreed to dispatch firefighting helicopters.
Some nine hours after the blaze was estimated to have begun exhausted firefighters, those from Haifa reinforced by teams from all over Israel, and by soldiers, were still struggling to bring it under control, but without success.
“We’ve lost control of the fire,” a spokesman for Haifa’s firefighting services was quoted as saying.
Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovich said it was impossible to say when the fire could be brought under control. However, firefighters were speculated that as the fire spread west a major road linking Haifa with Tel Aviv to the south could act as a natural firebreak, or, failing that, the sea would.
At least 22 people were confirmed dead, but other accounts put the number as high as 40.
The fatalities were prison guards who had been drafted to help evacuate the 500 prisoners from a jail in the path of the flames. Their bus, with 50 people on board, was trapped by a falling tree and 40 of them burned to death. The others were injured.
The fire had been far from the road when the bus first set off, but spread about 1,500 metres in less than three minutes.",https://wildfiretoday.com/2010/12/02/wildfire-in-israel-kills-40/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

“Anybody, whether they’re businesses, whether they’re residences, camping or anything else, everybody has been evacuated from the area,” said Bureau of Land Management spokeswoman Cass Cairns.
By Monday evening, winds with gusts of 20 mph to 30 mph had pushed the fire northeast from the intersection of U.S. 50 and Colorado 9 over 700 acres. Smoke and poor visibility closed U.S. 50 6 miles west of Ca?on City.
The Fremont County Sheriff’s Office called 177 businesses and residents asking them to evacuate. Cairns said it was unclear how many structures had burned or whether any were homes.
Smoke from the fire burning in an area known as Parkdale could be seen and smelled in Colorado Springs on Monday night.
The National Weather Service issued a red flag warning for the region, advising that strong winds and relatively low humidity might cause the fire to spread.
About 50 firefighters were battling the fire on the ground, supported by a fleet of aircraft dropping flame retardant, Cairns said. These included one large air tanker, a single-engine plane, a large helicopter and a smaller helicopter.
Mike Bandera, general manager of the Royal Gorge Bridge, said the historic bridge was not threatened but that homes along Fremont County Road 61 were evacuated.
Bandera said he first saw the flames about 1:30 p.m. Monday, jumping as high as 20 feet into the air.
Overnight, firefighters will continue to monitor the blaze and create fire breaks to minimize the spread. They will fight the fire depending on the direction it is headed, how active it is and on firefighter safety, Cairns said.
Meanwhile, the fire sparked by lightning in the Great Sand Dunes National Park a few weeks ago has engulfed 4,700 acres. Strong winds stoked the blaze.
On the Western Slope, a 170-acre blaze was burning on the Roan Plateau, 10 miles northwest of Rifle.
“It’s a fairly remote, rugged area and not threatening any structures,” said Dave Boyd, spokesman for the Upper Colorado River Interagency Fire Management Unit.

He also praised firefighters for their bravery after two died and several were badly injured in forest fires this week.
He said the government had activated the European Union's Civil Protection Mechanism to get additional firefighting equipment and was doing all in its power to prevent wildfires from spreading further. Scorching heat and winds were ""particularly adverse"" this year, he said.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas painted a grim portrait of the drought's impact on agriculture:
""Comments from bankers noted widespread negative impacts of the dry conditions -- low or nonexistent yields for many dryland crops, stress to irrigated crops and very poor pasture conditions,"" the bank said in its second-quarter survey of credit conditions.
The Dallas Fed also noted that many ranchers are sending their cattle to the slaughterhouse earlier than they normally would, pressured by bone-dry pastureland.
""Respondents in several regions mentioned that farmers will likely collect crop insurance money to offset drought losses,"" the bank said. ""There were numerous reports of ranchers liquidating their cattle herds due to inadequate grazing conditions and a lack of surface water.""
Miller said farmers are slaughtering cattle so they don't have to keep feeding them, since the Texas hay harvest has been ravaged by the drought.
""Ranchers are trying to sell their cattle because they don't have feed or hay,"" he said. ""Feed prices are just ridiculous. We're trucking hay in from Missouri.

""I know it's difficult because everybody's really concerned about their home and whether there's damage, or burnt to the ground and what's salvagable,"" he said.
""It has to be done orderly, because it is a very large area and we want to make sure that anybody coming back here is safe.""
Stelmach struck a task force of governmental ministries and agencies to deal with the immediate needs of the community and to provide support services to the residents of Slave Lake over the coming days, weeks and months.
Stelmach said he spoke with Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who offered assistance. Stelmach said provincial employees are at the evacuation centres to get an idea of what sort of help the burned-out residents need.

The RCMP said the Town of Slave Lake is on fire and many homes have burned down. The fire is apparently out of control, engulfing about half of the town.
The fires are in the north and east portion of the town, but winds are slowing down, giving officials hope the fires could be brought under control.
But residents are describing chaos.
""It's horrible; it's just going to spread because houses are ten feet apart,"" Myrna Franklin told CTV Edmonton. ""Our house is out of town, I don't know if it's gone yet or not.""
The Town of Slave Lake has issued a mandatory evacuation order and there have been reports that police are arresting anyone who does not comply.
""We are asking people who are able to travel and have the fuel to get to Athabasca, to leave the community,"" Mayor Karina Pillay said. ""If they do not have transportation or fuel we are asking them to come down to the Northern Lakes College (evacuation centre) and register with us.""
Earlier Sunday, the highways leading out of the town were blocked, forcing officials to tell people to flee to parking lots, the beach or any other wide-open green space.
But one highway is running late Sunday, and residents are now told to get out. Traffic is moving out, but at a slow pace.
There have been no reports of injuries yet, but communication is troublesome as power keeps going out. The local radio station was issuing emergency reports until it succumbed to fire.
There are about 200 firefighters in the town but conditions are lined up against them. Wind gusts of up to 100 kilometres an hour, have made water-bombers ineffective.
The first fire broke out to the southwest of Slave Lake, at about noon local time on Saturday.

In a letter sent to President Barack Obama over the weekend, the governor identified 252 Texas counties presently threatened or impacted by wildfires.
Since wildfire season began, Texas fire officials have responded to 7,807 fires across the state that have burned more than 1,528,714 acres and destroyed 244 homes. One firefighter has died and 18 others injured.
Near Strawn Texas, rancher Joel Stephens says fires have so far burned 1,200 acres of his family's ranch, but they've been lucky since nearly all their livestock are accounted for and the fire did not burn their house, hay or barns. There's still a threat though as winds switch direction. Stephens, who is also a firefighter, is prepared to take steps to save the home and barns should the fire start moving back.
He says the landscape around there resembles what you see with tornadoes. Some homes are devastated while others are intact almost like an oasis in the desert.
In some areas, town officials are packing up essential documents and closing courthouses as fires move closer. And homes in the fires path are being evacuated in order to save lives.
Firefighters from all over have moved into help control the blazes. ""When the fires first started, we had local firefighters, but now there are firefighters helping battle the blazes from other areas,"" says Stephens.

""We lost everything,"" said Willie Clements, whose two-story colonial home in a housing development near Bastrop was reduced to a heap of metal roofing and ash. A picket fence was melted. Some goats and turkeys survived, but about 20 chickens and ducks were burned to death in a coop that went up in flames. On Tuesday, Clements and his family took a picture of themselves in front of a windmill adorned with a charred red, white and blue sign that proclaimed, ""United We Stand.""

Most of those deaths are concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa, where an estimated 157,000 people die as a result of being exposed to such fires annually, with southeast Asia ranking second with 110,000 deaths.
""I was surprised at our estimate being so high when you consider that the exposure to fire smoke is quite intermittent for most people,"" said lead author Fay Johnston of the University of Tasmania.
""Even in southeast Asia and Africa, (fire) is a seasonal phenomenon. It is not year round,"" Johnston said at the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting in Vancouver where she presented her research.
The study, which Johnston said was the first of its kind to attempt to estimate a death toll from wildfires and landscape burns, was published Saturday in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives.
Researchers looked at the number of deaths from all causes in areas that were exposed to heavy smoke and landscape fire between 1997 and 2006.
They used satellite data and chemical transport models to assess the health impacts of particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers, a major byproduct of landscape fire smoke.
The number of deaths from wildfires came in far below the previously estimated global tolls for indoor air pollution at two million people per year and urban air pollution at 800,000.
However, the study authors said their findings indicated that ""fire emissions are an important contributor to global mortality.""

3,," In the tinder-dry U.S. West, where campfires, fireworks and even lit cigarettes are banned across public lands, another fire-starting culprit remains free of most restrictions: guns.
This year, officials believe target shooting or other firearms use have sparked at least 21 wildfires in Utah and nearly a dozen in Idaho. Shooting is also believed to have caused fires in Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico.
Officials have been asking the public to scale back shooting as legions of firefighters contend with one of the busiest and most destructive wildfire seasons to ever hit the West.
But many in the region avid proponents of the Second Amendment right to bear arms, so most state lawmakers are hesitant to enact any formal restrictions.
""We're not trying to pull away anyone's right to bear arms. I want to emphasize that,"" said Louinda Downs, a county commissioner in fire-prone Davis County, Utah. ""We're just saying, target practice in winter. Target practice on the gun range. When your pleasure hobby is infringing or threatening someone else's right to have property or life, shouldn't we be able to somehow have some authority so we can restrict that?""
The state's Republican Gov. Gary Herbert took the unusual step of authorizing the top state forest official to impose gun restrictions on public lands after a gunfire-sparked fire. Herbert said his decision doesn't limit gun rights, but is a common-sense response to dry conditions.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/guns-blamed-for-sparking-some-wildfires-in-west/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Springs Fire had burned more than 28,000 acres of rugged, brush-covered terrain by late afternoon and was 20% contained, the state's fire agency reported.
Forecasters said a weekend of increased humidity should help teams fighting the early-season blaze make gains Saturday.
""It's a total turnaround from what we had,"" said Kurt Kaplan, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Oxnard. ""It should be a much better day for firefighters tomorrow.""
At midday Friday, the temperature hit a record 96 in Camarillo, where the blaze began, about 50 miles north of Los Angeles.
Thousands of residents had already evacuated the Ventura County fire, including 118 families ordered from a premier Navy base because of heavy smoke after flames jumped the scenic highway.
The fire began Thursday during the morning rush hour near U.S. 101, which is the major commuter route into Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley. After reaching the coast overnight, the fire headed back inland Friday.
The fire had damaged 15 homes and destroyed at least 25 outbuildings and other property by midday. Large animals and livestock were being taken to the county fairgrounds.
No operations were affected Friday morning at the sprawling Naval Base Ventura County, which was already operating on an ""essential mission"" basis. The base has a population of more than 19,000 personnel and operates two runways, a sea-test range and deep-water port.
The evacuation order only affected the San Miguel housing unit for the Point Mugu air station. ""This is due to smoke, rather than fire, concerns,"" public affairs officer Kimberly Gearhart announced on the base's Facebook page.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Tasmania Fire Service (TFS) says the out-of-control blaze has spread south of Murdunna and has active fire edges back to Forcett and Dodges Ferry.
The service says Taranna is currently being affected by the fire and it is too late for residents to leave the town.
It is understood a number of properties near Eaglehawk Neck have been lost.
The peninsula remains cut off with the Arthur Highway closed until further notice.
Phil Douglas from the TFS says people need to keep off the highway near the Forcett and Nubeena areas.

U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Julie Thomas says no injuries or damage to structures were reported.
The Clark County Department of Air Quality extended a health advisory for smoke and ground-level ozone through Sunday around Las Vegas.
Some 600 firefighters were battling the blaze with the help of an aerial assault involving five helicopters and five air tankers, but they’re hampered by steep, rugged terrain, temperatures in the upper 90s and wind gusts of up to 40 mph.

3,," A wildfire is burning out of control on North Mountain in Pendleton County in the Monongahela National Forest. More than 80 foresters and local firefighters are battling the blaze that started on Sunday near Upper Tract.
“[The fire] started on private land and it’s moved west/northwest on to national forest land, southwest of Petersburg,” according to Sarah Hankens with the U.S. Forest Service.
The blaze is 20 percent contained. It’s being called the North Mountain Fire and so far has destroyed 720 acres.
Bob Beanblossom with the U.S. Forest Service said crews are having a hard time reaching some parts of the fire because of the terrain in the Potomac Highlands.
“It is steep, rocky terrain. There are a lot of standing, dead trees that firefighters have to be careful of. It does certainly pose some hazards.” Beanblossom said half the battle is reaching those remote areas.
The fire is so large, the U.S. Forest Service has called in crews from out west.
“We have a lot of folks here from the Monongahela National Forest but there are crews from as far west as Oregon, Idaho and Washington,” explained Beanblossom.
Even more foresters are set to arrive from Tennessee, Virginia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Wisconsin.
Most of the fire is contained within the national forest and that’s where crews want to keep it.
“There is private property adjacent to the forest, not too far from where the fire is located,” said Hankens. “We do have personnel out on the fire line assessing both direct and indirect ways to create fire lines to try and keep the fire on national forest.”
So far, that part of Pendleton County has not seen any of the rain or snow much of the state received Tuesday morning. However, the humidity is high and that’s keeping the flames from spreading faster.

The fire was called in at about 10:15 a.m. Thursday and fire fighters arrived on the scene by 11 a.m. Additional fire departments were called to help battle the blaze, which started at the intersection of Iron County Road 73 and Highway 32. The fire continued to move east on Highway 32 throughout the night and into Friday morning.
Increased winds from the southeast pushed the fire over Highway 32 where another section of land, just west of Council Bluff Lake, was devastated, forcing the highway’s closure. It has been closed from highway 49 south to Route A.
Council Bluffs campground is still open as of press time, but may be difficult to get to, and the campground could be closed if it becomes necessary.
""What is really driving this fire is low humidity and high temperatures. This creates a situation where the fire is actually pushing itself. It is essentially creating its own wind. This is a situation we see often out west, such as in the Colorado Fires, but not usually in Missouri,"" said Susan Zornek-Stevens, U.S Forest Service Public Information Officer.
There were some residential structures within a mile of the fire, but no residents had been evacuated as of press time. Officials say they will take that precaution if the fire spreads any closer to those homes.
Jody Eberly with the Mark Twain National Forest said things are so dry, the fires are getting into the tops of the trees as well.
She is cautioning people to be extra careful. With conditions this dry, even throwing a cigarette out of a car window or on the ground from the sidewalk can quickly start a large fire that could endanger many homes and lives.

The 7,000-hectare (17,000-acre) blaze, which has a 80-kilometer (50-mile) perimeter, began on Monday and raged through the night near the town of Wooroloo, with the shires of Mundaring, Chittering, Northam, and the city of Swan affected.
“Firefighters have done a remarkable job in some of the most challenging conditions that we’ve experienced in the metropolitan region for some time,” Western Australia state Department of Fire and Emergency Services Commissioner Darren Klemm said.
“Tragically, 59 properties have been lost in this fire and that number may increase as we continue to assess the extent of the damage,” Klemm added.
Six firefighters sustained minor injuries, Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported. No other injuries were reported.
The fire doubled in size overnight and burned through 7,366 hectares (18,202 acres) of farm and woodland, officials said.
State Premier Mark McGowan said 80% of all properties at Tilden Park near Gidgegannup on Perth’s northeast rural fringe have been lost.
McGowan said a large aerial tanker was flying from the Australian east coast to help fight the blaze.
“This is an extremely dangerous fire and a serious situation. Weather conditions are extremely volatile,” McGowan said.
“Please do everything you can to keep you and your family safe and look after each other,” he added.

Here, we take a close-up look at five of these numbers: where they come from, and whether they're for real.
The most obvious way to communicate the scale of a fire disaster — and compare it to other fires — is by focusing on the area of land the fire that has burned.

3,,"Nearly three billion animals – mammals, reptiles, birds, and frogs – were killed or displaced by Australia’s devastating 2019-20 bushfires.
It’s almost three times an earlier estimate released in January.
The breakdown is 143 million mammals, 2.46 billion reptiles, 180 million birds, and 51 million frogs.
Those figures are revealed in an interim report entitled Australia’s 2019-2020 Bushfires: The Wildlife Toll, commissioned by the World Wide Fund for Nature and believed to be world first research.
Ten scientists from the University of Sydney, University of New South Wales, University of Newcastle, Charles Sturt University, and BirdLife Australia contributed the majority of the work.
The project is being led by Dr Lily Van Eeden and overseen by Professor Chris Dickman, both from the University of Sydney.
While results are still being finalised, the headline figure of nearly three billion animals impacted is unlikely to change.
“The interim findings are shocking. It’s hard to think of another event anywhere in the world in living memory that has killed or displaced that many animals. This ranks as one of the worst wildlife disasters in modern history,” said WWF-Australia CEO Dermot O’Gorman.
“When you think about nearly three billion native animals being in the path of the fires it is absolutely huge, it’s a difficult number to comprehend,” said Professor Dickman.
While the scientists cannot say how many animals died, Professor Dickman said the prospects for animals which escaped the flames were “probably not that great” because of a lack of food and shelter or being forced into habitat already occupied.
In January, Professor Dickman, working with WWF scientists, produced an early estimate that 1.25 billion animals were impacted. However, that calculation focused only on the states of New South Wales and Victoria.
Dr Van Eeden said for this project the team examined a fire impact area of 11.46 million hectares.
“We believe a continent-wide assessment of the number of animals that might be impacted has never been done in Australia before or anywhere else in the world. Other nations can build upon this research to improve understanding of bushfire impacts everywhere,” Dr Van Eeden said.
Mr O’Gorman said with extreme fires becoming more frequent because of climate change the interim findings “give other countries a window into the future of mega fires and their devastating impact on wildlife”.
He said the research had also been released in time to be considered by the review of Australia’s flagship environment law – the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act.
“Following such a heavy toll on Australia’s wildlife, strengthening this law has never been more important. WWF will continue to advocate for policies that benefit both people and nature, restore what has been lost, and ensure we build back a more resilient Australia,” Mr O’Gorman said.
Professor Dickman said the research shows people that mega fires are changing the environment and depleting native biodiversity and change is necessary.
“How quickly can we decarbonise? How quickly can we stop our manic land clearing? We land clear at a rate that’s one of the highest in the world,” Professor Dickman said.
The recommendations in the interim report call for addressing knowledge gaps on wildlife densities and responses to fire, improving habitat connectivity to help mobile species escape fire, identifying and protecting unburnt habitat crucial to threatened species, improving fire prevention and management, and establishing rapid response teams to help species impacted by fire.

3,,"In the wake of the enormous fires that have razed huge swathes of drought-stricken Australia, scientists fear that when rains eventually fall, they will wash charred debris into rivers, dams, and the ocean, killing wildlife and even tainting the drinking supplies of major cities, such as Sydney.
For many weeks, ash, soot, and blackened gum tree leaves have collected along the shorelines of Sydney’s beaches, clogging the waves and lapping in the tide. Originating in fires blazing in forested areas to the west, the debris has been carried on the breeze along with the pungent bushfire smoke that blanketed Australia’s largest city for much of December.
But what has carried on the wind is just a taste of the huge quantities of debris that are likely to wash into rivers once there are heavy downpours. As of press time, more than 26 million acres—an area bigger than Portugal—have now burned, mostly in the continent’s southeast. That includes areas of land known as catchments—also called watersheds—where rainfall begins its earthly journey into specific rivers, lakes, and dams.
It is an ecological disaster unprecedented in Australia’s history, and that spells trouble for drinking water supplies, coastal ecosystems, and the freshwater rivers that support iconic Australian wildlife, such as the platypus.

Climate scientists are currently examining data from the disaster, which destroyed swathes of southeastern Australia, to determine to what extent they can be attributed to rising temperatures.
In a special edition of the journal Nature Climate Change, Australian researchers examined several other aspects of the blazes, including investigations into their extent and possible causes.
One study showed that between September 2019 and January 2020 around 5.8 million hectares of broadleaf forest were burned in New South Wales and Victoria.
This accounts for roughly 21 percent of the nation's forested area, making this fire season proportionately the most devastating on record.
""Halfway through Spring 2019 we realised that a very large part of the eastern Australian forest could be burned in this single season,"" Matthias Boer, from the Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment at Western Sydney University, Penrith, told AFP.
""The shock came from realising that this season was off the charts globally in terms of the percentage of the continental section of a forest biome that burned.""
Boer said his study almost certainly underestimates the extent of forest loss as the island state of Tasmania was not covered in the data.

Fires raging in Australia since September have killed 24 people, destroyed more than 1,500 homes, and razed 6 million hectares of land, leaving more than 500 million animals dead. The bushfires, which are among the worst in the country’s history, have been fuelled by record temperatures — 41.9 °C on 17 December — and several months of intense droughts.

The number of forest fires in Brazil's Amazon rainforest increased 28% in July in comparison to last year, the country's National Institute for Space Research reported Saturday.
Brazil holds around 60% of the Amazon basin region and environmentalists say this area is vital to containing the impact of climate change.
The state agency recorded 6,803 fires in the Amazon last month, compared to 5,318 in the same month of 2019.
Environmentalists were alarmed by the figure, particularly because August traditionally marks the beginning of the fire season in the region. Many now fear that a repeat of the large surge in fires that devastated the area last August could occur this year again.
 ""More than 1,000 fires in a single day is a 15-year record and shows the government's strategy of media-spectacle operations is not working on the ground,"" Greenpeace spokesman Romulo Batista said in a statement.

Satellites in September recorded 32,017 hotspots in the world’s largest rainforest, a 61% rise from the same month in 2019.
In August last year, surging fires in the Amazon captured global headlines and prompted criticism from world leaders such as France’s Emmanuel Macron that Brazil was not doing enough to protect the rainforest.
On Tuesday, the US Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, called for a world effort to offer $20bn to end Amazon deforestation and threatened Brazil with unspecified “economic consequences” if it did not “stop tearing down the forest”.
President Jair Bolsonaro lambasted Biden’s comment as a “cowardly threat” to Brazil’s sovereignty and a “clear sign of contempt”.
Data from Inpe released on Thursday showed that in 2019, fires spiked in August and declined considerably the month after, but this year’s peak has been more sustained. Both August and September of 2020 have matched or surpassed last year’s single-month high.
“We have had two months with a lot of fire. It’s already worse than last year,” said Ane Alencar, science director for Brazil’s Amazon Environmental Research Institute (Ipam).
“It could get worse if the drought continues. We are at the mercy of the rain.”
The Amazon is experiencing a more severe dry season than last year, which scientists attribute in part to warming in the tropical North Atlantic Ocean pulling moisture away from South America.
The entire Amazon, which spans nine countries, currently has 28,892 active fires, according to a fire monitoring tool funded in part by the US space agency, Nasa.
The fires in September are not only burning recently deforested areas and farmland, where ranchers set them to clear land, but are also increasingly burning virgin forest, a worrying trend that suggests the rainforest is becoming drier and more prone to fire.
Roughly 62% of major Amazon fires were in forests in September, compared with only 15% in August, according to an analysis of satellite images by the US-based non-profit Amazon Conservation.
The warming of the North Atlantic is also helping drive drought in the Brazilian Pantanal, the world’s largest wetland, which has suffered more fires this year than ever previously recorded, according to Inpe data.
A Federal University of Rio de Janeiro analysis found that 23% of the wetlands, which are home to the densest population of jaguars in the world, has burned.

Since Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro took office, governmental measures to curb illegal fires have shown little impact, as flames and deforestation erase vast swathes of the world's biggest rainforest.
Most fires in the Amazon are set by land-grabbers and wildcat ranchers, seeking to transform parts of the rainforest into their own lucrative agricultural enterprises. And this August was a particularly bad time for such fires: Preliminary data collected by the National Spatial Research Institute (INPE) show 29,307 fires in the Brazilian Amazon last month.
However, due to a technical issue with the NASA satellite tracking fires, experts say that figure could be even higher. The final tally of fires recorded in August is expected to rise 2% above the August 2019 total, says Albert Setzer, INPE's senior scientist -- which would make this August the worst in 10 years.
The more fires there are, the faster the rainforest is transformed into grasslands for illicit cattle and soy-growing operations. According to research from NGO MapBiomas, which tracks land use in Brazil, 95% of the deforested area in Brazil in 2019 wasn't authorized. ""Most of (the fires) are illegal,"" said Tasso Azevedo, a former head of Brazil's forest service and coordinator of MapBiomas.

Thanks to a recovery program that began in 1995, their numbers in the wild increased from 150 to 400. Scientists responded by downgrading the birds’ status from critically endangered with extinction to just endangered.
But that all changed in January. Now this bird is part of an unfolding horror story.
Fires have raged across nearly 50 percent of Kangaroo Island. That’s their 4,400-square-kilometer (1,700-square-mile) isle off the coast of the state of South Australia. Flames destroyed the habitat for most of the birds. It’s unclear how many glossy black cockatoos survived. For those that did, food may now be scarce. These birds eat the seeds of a single tree species: the drooping she oak.
Many years of hard work to save these birds have gone up in smoke, says Daniella Teixeira. She’s a conservation biologist who works 2,184 kilometers (some 1,360 miles) away at Australia’s University of Queensland in Brisbane. This fire has brought “a big step backwards for the recovery team,” Teixeira concludes. And it’s something she understands well. She has studied and worked to protect these cockatoos for the last four years. Even if just one in every four of the birds died, she says, this subspecies could again be deemed critically endangered with extinction.
Similar stories are playing out across Australia. As of January 12, months of wildfires had burned nearly 11 million hectares (more than 42,470 square miles). That’s an area larger than the nation of Guatemala and a little bigger than the state of Tennessee. More than 2,200 homes have gone up in flames and 29 people died.

3,,"One year has passed since the world was shocked by the images of the fires blazing across the Amazon in Brazil. But since then, the forest hasn’t stopped burning —and 2020 could be even more devastating for the rainforest and the Indigenous Peoples who call it home. Last week, Greenpeace Brazil flew over the state of Mato Grosso to capture images of the Amazon. Even though the government had ordered a ban on forest fires in the state starting at the beginning of July, the photos show smoke, flames, and just how ineffective the ban has been.
Last year, more than 1 million hectares of forest were burned, and the trend shows the destruction is far from over. Last June, more than two thousand fire hotspots were registered in the Amazon, the highest number in the last thirteen years. Since Brazil’s President Bolsonaro took office in January 2019, his government’s agenda has been very clear: dismantle environmental protection law and agencies, so that forest destroyers can burn the forest freely, clearing the land to turn it into pastures, without being held accountable. 
The consequences of this destruction are dire. From Siberia to the Amazon, fires are raging across the world. Losing our forests means losing the fight against the climate crisis, putting biodiversity at risk of extinction, and threatening the lives of Indigenous Peoples who depend on the forest standing for their survival. Fighting to protect the forest and Indigenous lands from fires and deforestation become even more difficult—and crucial —during a pandemic. 
With a mortality rate from COVID-19 150% higher than the Brazilian average, Indigenous Peoples are already more vulnerable during the pandemic. The smoke from the fires will put their respiratory system at even higher risk during a time when access to healthcare is limited in remote areas in the Amazon.
But things can be different. After the public’s outcry last year, there is increasing pressure on Brazil’s government. Investors, companies and governments have been signaling their concerns about the destruction of the forest and its impact on the environment, and their message is clear: they don’t want to do business with forest destroyers. Even though last week Bolsonaro announced a “fire moratorium” for 120 days, the images of Mato Grosso show how his measures have been performative and inefficient.

Bolsonaro defends his plans to introduce mining and farming in protected reserves as a way to lift the region out of poverty.
This year, the president authorized a military deployment from May to November to combat deforestation and forest fires. He has also banned setting fires in the region for 120 days.
In 2019, Brazil instituted the same temporary policies later in the year, only after fires in the Amazon provoked global outcry in August.
Scientists say the rainforest is a vital defense against climate warming because it absorbs greenhouse gases.

3,,"Cool and relatively moist, Swedish summers aren’t known for promoting wildfire. Fires occur in most years, but not on the scale or intensity of the blaze that raged through boreal forests in August 2014.
It’s not clear how it got started, but fast-growing fire has consumed V?stmanland since July 31. In a week, the blaze grew to become the largest Sweden has seen in four decades. As of August 8, it had charred more than 150 square kilometers (60 square miles), killed one person, and forced thousands to evacuate their homes.
The Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat 8 captured this natural-color image of the fire on August 4, 2014. Multiple smoke plumes rise from the perimeter of the fire and blow northwest in the wind. Burned forest appears brown; unaffected forests are dark green; farmland is light green; and fallow fields are tan.
Hot and dry weather exacerbated the fire, stressing vegetation and priming it to burn. With a high-pressure system parked over Scandinavia, oppressive heat emerged across Sweden in July and August, bringing record or near-record temperatures to many towns and cities. In Sala, a city close to the fire, temperatures soared to 34.7°C (94.5°F) on August 5. Average temperatures are about 70°F (21°C) in early August.
Wildfires aren’t common or widespread in Sweden. According to a report published by the International Forest Fire News, only a few hundred hectares (100 hectares is equivalent to 1 square kilometer) generally burn during the nation’s wet summers, and a few thousand hectares burn during dry summers. That’s less than 0.02 percent of Sweden’s overall forest cover.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Flaming tule reeds, eight to 10 feet high, burned over a boggy marsh filled with three to four feet of water. Firefighters relied on catwalks to get to the flames, but when the catwalks caught fire they had to slog through the marsh.
The Pittsburg power plant is currently non-operational. So there was no threat of a major power outage. The real threat came from transmission lines above.
""The PG&E transmission lines contain high voltage and in some cases smoke and particulate matter burning from fires can cause arcing between the lines and down to the ground, and that was a concern,"" said Laing.
Willow Pass Road was closed for about two hours preventing people from getting to work and home.
""Last summer we had the other side of the road catch on fire and we had pretty much the same situation and we were stuck out here. It was around the Fourth of July,"" said Steve Sebastian, a truck driver.

This is only the fourth time on record the country has reached the 9 million-acre mark, center spokesman Randall Eardley said in an e-mail. The area burned is roughly equivalent to the size of New Jersey and Connecticut combined.
All of the top years for acres burned have occurred since 2000, Eardley said. The worst year occurred in 2006, with 9.8 million acres. In 2007 and 2012, 9.3 million acres were burned, he said. If another 800,000 acres are burned this year, an all-time record would be set.
Accurate wildfire records go back to 1960. Prior to 2000, the U.S. surpassed 7 million acres only one time — in 1963. ""The year 2000 seems to have been a turning point in the number of acres we've seen burned,"" Eardley said.

3,,"There was a time when fire season in California started around May and went through September. Now, thanks to a drought that’s stretching into its fourth year, the state seems to have become a year-round tinderbox.
The long running drought has “created explosive fire conditions,” said Mike Mohler, a fire captain with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE). “Five years ago without a drought in California you would still get wildland fires. But the vegetation wouldn’t burn as quickly. Now there’s zero moisture and you get explosive fire growth.”
The drought has fed into a trend that’s been developing for over the past decade, said Daniel Berlant, chief of public information for CAL FIRE.
“Since 2000 we’ve been seeing larger and more damaging fires,” he said. “What we’re seeing now is that the rain is starting later and stopping much earlier. The fires are burning at explosive speed because the vegetation is so dry and that allows them to get much larger.”
It’s not just the low precipitation that’s the problem, Berlant says. It’s also the higher temperatures.
Those high temperatures are baking the moisture out of the soil and air, leaving vegetation especially dry and vulnerable to catching fire, said Park Williams, an assistant research professor at the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University.
Rising temperatures alone can boost the risk of wildfires, Williams said. “When you see wildfires in the Sierra Nevada and Northern Coast Ranges occurring early in the season it’s a testament to how warm conditions have become in spring,” he adds.
In a recent study published in the International Journal of Wildland Fire, Williams found that, in the Southwest, rising temperatures raised fire risk even in wetter years. That finding is likely to hold true for California, too, he said.
“Forests are excellent gauges of climate because they are not irrigated and they live for a very long time, allowing for tree-ring records and other aspects of forests to tell us how recent conditions fit into a long-term context,” Williams said. “As temperatures rise, the amount of water necessary to reduce a forest’s flammability goes up. In the absence of substantial increases in precipitation, warming causes increased flammability, and that very reliably translates to increased areas of forest burned.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3,Fire within CZU Lightning Complex burns 7 acres,"In Big Basin State Park south of San Francisco — may be a holdover from the fire 9 months ago
On Monday firefighters suppressed a fire that burned within the perimeter of the CZU Lightning Complex of fires. The blaze was in Big Basin Redwoods State Park south of San Francisco and could be a holdover from the 86,502-acre blaze from August, 2020.
When firefighters hiked into the fire it was less than two acres, but with the assistance of aircraft they stopped the spread after it burned about seven acres.
In January several other holdover fires were found in the footprint of the same fire.
There is a chance that considering the numerous very large fires that spread through California and Oregon last year, and with lower than normal precipitation during the winter, other similar holdover fires will be discovered. In many cases since they are within the burn perimeter, they may not be a serious problem. But if they are in a large unburned island, burning embers lofted into the air could ignite spot fires some distance away, perhaps outside the perimeter where there is an abundance of available fuel.

4,,"A megadrought worse than any in “known prehistory” may already be underway in the western United States and northern Mexico, researchers have suggested.
After experiencing a wetter-than-average 20th century, the region has been suffering an ever-lengthening string of dry years starting in 2000, and scientists have now warned the worsening climate crisis is partly responsible for pushing the region towards extreme long-term drought.
The study is based on modern weather observations, along with 1,200 years of tree-ring data and dozens of climate models.
“Earlier studies were largely model projections of the future,” said lead author Park Williams, a bioclimatologist at Columbia University‘s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.
“We’re no longer looking at projections, but at where we are now. We now have enough observations of current drought and tree-ring records of past drought to say that we’re on the same trajectory as the worst prehistoric droughts.”
Reliable modern observations date only to about 1900, but tree rings have allowed scientists to infer yearly soil moisture for centuries before humans began influencing the climate.
The study has rung alarm bells, as previous research has linked the catastrophic ancient droughts recorded in tree rings to concurrent upheavals among indigenous medieval-era civilisations in the southwest US.
The new study is the most up-to-date and comprehensive long-term analysis, the researchers have said. It covers an area stretching across nine US states from Oregon and Montana down through California and New Mexico, and part of northern Mexico.
Using rings from thousands of trees, the researchers charted dozens of droughts across the region, starting in 800 AD.
Four stand out as so-called megadroughts, with extreme aridity lasting decades: the late 800s, mid-1100s, the 1200s, and the late 1500s. After 1600, there were other droughts, but none on such a large scale.
The team then compared the ancient megadroughts to soil moisture records calculated from observed weather in the years from 2000 to 2018.
They found the current drought is already outdoing the three earliest ones. The fourth, which spanned 1575 to 1603, may have been the worst of all — but the difference is slight enough to be within the range of uncertainty.
Furthermore, the current drought is affecting wider areas more consistently than any of the earlier ones — this is the “fingerprint” of climate change and associated temperatures, the researchers said.
All of the ancient droughts lasted longer than 19 years — the one that started in the 1200s ran for nearly a century — but all began by following a similar path to what is happening now, they said.
The ancient droughts weren’t driven by manmade climate change, and nature is still playing a strong role today.
A study last year led by Nathan Steiger at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University showed among other things, that unusually cool periodic conditions over the tropical Pacific Ocean (commonly called La Ni?a) during the previous megadroughts pushed storm tracks further north, and starved the region of precipitation.",https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/megadrought-us-mexico-climate-change-global-warming-study-a9470516.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Parts of the country have been affected by consecutive years of abnormally hot weather and below average rainfall that have scorched grazing lands and dried up watering holes since 2015, the driest year on record.
Industry body Wildlife Ranching South Africa (WRSA) estimates the Northern Cape province has lost more than two-thirds of its game over the last three years.
It is conducting a countrywide survey to determine the scale of animal losses and the financial impact on the country's more than 9,000 wildlife ranches.
“It's been an extraordinary drought,” said WRSA chief Adri Kitshoff-Botha. “It's not a one-year or two-year drought. In some areas we've seen it has been going now for six years.”
The wildlife industry generates revenue for South Africa through tourism, hunting, breeding and meat production.
Trophy hunting alone generated 2bn rand (￡106m) in 2016, according to research carried out for the environment ministry.
Southern Africa's temperatures are rising at twice the global average rate, according to the International Panel on Climate Change, and in much of South Africa the level of water in reservoirs is dwindling.

Glacial loss in the region has been going on for a few decades. However, the rate has increased – between 2000 and 2016, glaciers were shrinking 1.6 times faster than the period between 1951 to 2007.
“A lot of the climate projections suggest the melt will continue to accelerate,” lead researcher Dr Hamish Pritchard, a glaciologist from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), told The Independent.
Using climate projections, Dr Pritchard believes the glacier melt will start to slow in around 2050.
He added: “As we start to get drought stress hitting, there will be crop failures and a loss of livestock. It could cause people to migrate and if you can’t migrate, it might cause conflict as people will need to fight with their neighbours for food.”
This will hit areas such as the fertile Indus Valley, which has been inhabited by human civilisations for many thousands of years and today feeds 237 million people.
The increase in glacier melt is also causing a glut of water to come down, causing an increase in water consumption.",https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/climate-change-asia-glaciers-shrinking-himalayas-science-a8934901.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The period of so-called “mega drought”, of which the consequences are only starting to be seen, is thought to have begun in 2000, with peaks in periods of severe drought – and wildfires.
As shown in figures from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the period was responsible for the two worst droughts to occur, in 2003 and 2013.
Figures for 2020-2021 are more alarming, with the amount of area being in a state of ""exceptional drought"" at 20 per cent – wider than at any point for 20 years.

A total of 275,000 people were displaced by drought this year, 52,000 more than the number who fled conflict, with more than two million threatened by the effects of water shortages.
Reports from the UN and aid charities described farmers lacking seeds to sow, following crop failures in some areas, and livestock dying from the lack of anything to eat。
Afghanistan, where nearly 20 million people rely on farming, has suffered a 45 per cent drop in agricultural output this year as drought hit the country, officials at the ministry of agriculture have said.
At least 120,000 people fleeing the drought arrived in the town of Qala-e-Naw, in Badghis province, in the week leading up to 9 September, the UN humanitarian office reported.
A second UN report, which contained data covering August, said more than 100,000 people may have moved to Herat city for the same reason by the end of last month.

Circular dry plough tracks resemble the concentric circles in Aboriginal dot paintings that tell of an ancient mythology, starving cattle queuing for feed look like an abstract painting, and their black shadows stretching across the land a surrealist image.
But for farmer Ash Whitney there is no such beauty, just blood, sweat and tears as he struggles to feed his cattle, cutting the drying branches of Kurrajong trees – a last resort during the worst of droughts.
“I have been here all my life, and this drought is feeling like it will be around a while,” says a despairing Whitney, whose property near the town of Gunnedah is on the Liverpool Plains – a usually fertile area now withered, having received the lowest average rainfall in nearly 30 years.
The worst drought in living memory is sweeping parts of eastern Australia, leaving farmers struggling to cope and asking questions about the future.
Cattle farmer Tom Wollaston, born 70 years ago in the same house he lives in today, is afraid for what this drought will mean for his children, who aim to takeover the 2,300 hectare (5,683 acre) property when Tom “hangs up his boots”.
“I can't seem to be able to do anything else apart from just feed, and keep things going. The drought seems to be one step ahead of me all the time. We'll battle it out, but it puts a strain on everyone,” says Wollaston.
His wife Margo says droughts have a very negative impact, not only on her family but on the whole farming community around the nearby town of Tamworth in northwest New South Wales (NSW) state.
“I find droughts a little bit like cancer – it sort of eats away at you, and it just gets drier and drier and more severe and more severe, and impacting on your life a lot worse.

According to Météo France, from July 1 to July 28, average precipitation represented only 28 per cent of normal values ??across the country, making last month the driest July since 1959.
The southwest, Loire Valley and northeast were particularly affected by this significantly prolonged deficit of rains, known as a meteorological drought.
Prefectural decrees limiting the use of water have been issued in 73 of the country's 101 départements with 20 already experiencing crisis situations.
Hard-hit vegetation
As a consequence of this lack of rain, the country's soil is drier than usual, which is impairing the proper development of vegetation.
This agricultural drought ""must be watched"" in the northeastern region Grand Est, as well as in Auvergne-Rh?ne-Alpes, in Hauts-de-France and Lower Normandy, notes the country's meteorological agency.
This situation (drought, high temperature) also favours the development of wildfires.
Dry riverbeds
The largest French river, the Loire, is currently experiencing a sharp drop in its flow. The prefecture of the department of Maine-et-Loire, for example, has put in place many restrictions due to the situation.
Waterways have even completely disappeared in the northeast of the country, like the Doubs which is completely dry with the riverbed transformed into grazing ground for cattle.

4,,"As more frequent river droughts will stretch the continent’s water resources, people, and economies must find new ways to adapt.
On 1 June 2018, results showed 4.5%. One month later, it was 10.8%; almost four months later, on 20 October, about 35.9% of Europe’s rivers were flowing abnormally low, the lowest since at least 1991. A summer of little to no rain left major water systems without their much needed water; repeated heat waves were also speeding up evaporation, leading to more water loss. This year, drought was already underway in April, in a big part of Central Europe, ranging from moderate to extreme, according to data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) and in many regions the drought has continued throughout June, making 2020 the third year in a row with unexpectedly dry conditions, according to the Copernicus Emergency Management service.
In the future, this might not be such an uncommon event. Halfway through this century, droughts are predicted to become more frequent, threatening a wide range of sectors, from water and energy supply to river transport and agriculture. “The Mediterranean sub-region, already suffering most from water scarcity, is projected to experience the strongest negative effects of climate change on drought conditions,” the Joint Research Center (JRC) Droughts Team told Euronews. “With increasing global warming, streamflow deficits in this region are expected to happen more frequently, become more severe and last longer,” the JRC team said. If global temperatures rise by 3 degrees, the researchers say an additional 11 million people and 4.5 million hectares could be annually exposed to droughts that used to occur only once every 10 years or so. “We see a strong divide within Europe, with more drought in the South and less in the North,” says Dr. Niko Wanders, hydrological extremes researcher at Utrecht University. “We’re observing that extreme droughts are likely to become more severe. This is caused by a combination of higher temperatures and more evaporation that results in bigger water losses,” says Dr. Wanders.
A noticeable factor comes from the fact that rivers are also receiving less water from glaciers, according to experts at the University of Birmingham. Warming in the European Alps in the last three decades, combined with less snowfall has resulted in a little bit under a 54% loss in glacier ice area since 1850; long-term predictions show further drastic reductions.
Rivers affected by drought lose more than water depth. Less rainwater means that river waters cannot dilute pollutants efficiently; this leads to higher concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as of heavy metals and microplastics, according to experts from the MaRIUS research consortium. The organic build up boosts algal production, leading to blooms that could make the water unusable for human use. Hotter river waters also hold less oxygen than cold ones, which harms fish and other aquatic fauna.",https://www.euronews.com/2020/08/03/flowing-low-how-can-europe-use-climate-information-to-manage-dry-river-spells,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seven years after the Millennium drought baked southeastern Australia, a large fraction of the region’s rivers still show no signs of returning to their predrought water flow, researchers report in the May 14 Science.
There’s “an implicit assumption that no matter how big a disturbance is, the water will always come back — it’s just a matter of how long it takes,” says Tim Peterson, a hydrologist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. “I’ve never been satisfied with that.”
The years-long drought in southeastern Australia, which began sometime between 1997 and 2001 and lasted until 2010, offered a natural experiment to test this assumption, he says. “It wasn’t the most severe drought” the region has ever experienced, but it was the longest period of low rainfall in the region since about 1900.
Peterson and colleagues analyzed annual and seasonal streamflow rates in 161 river basins in the region from before, during and after the drought. By 2017, they found, 37 percent of those river basins still weren’t seeing the amount of water flow that they had predrought. Furthermore, of those low-flow rivers, the vast majority — 80 percent — also show no signs that they might recover in the future, the team found.",https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-river-drought-australia-recovery-water-flow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4,,"Over the past two years, drought has severely affected much of Brazil. According to a bulletin from the National Center for Monitoring and Alerts on Natural Disasters (Cemaden), an agency of the Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovations and Communications, rainfall has been below historical averages in the center-west, south and part of the southeast regions of the country, including in the state of S?o Paulo.
The phenomenon became more evident in 2012. “Severe drought started in the northeast and lasted almost seven years,” says Cemaden researcher Adriana Cuartas. “Then, in 2014, water supply was in critical conditions in the Greater S?o Paulo area. Now the focus of concerns turns to the south, where rainfall has been below average for almost two years.”
Scientist Ant?nio Donato Nobre, author of the report “The Future Climate of Amazonia,” is emphatic: “South America is drying up as a result of the combined effects of deforestation and climate change.”
Low precipitation has an immediate impact on agriculture. The next affected are water supply and power generation. Water levels in the reservoirs of several dams have been low, including Itaipu, the world’s second-largest hydroelectric power plant. “The water that comes from the rivers to the reservoir is below the minimum level recorded in 1993. It’s a critical situation,” Cuartas says. “The Itaipu basin is used not only for power generation, but also for water supply.”
Recent rains in the south may bring temporary relief to agriculture, but water conditions take time to return to normal. “Rainfall would have to be at average levels or above for several months for the water system to start recovering and resume expected levels,” Cuartas says.
Agribusiness has been suffering losses as a result of drought, but it also contributes to the changes in the water regime. Deforesting the Amazon to establish cattle ranches, plantations and logging reduces precipitation in Brazil and other Latin American countries. With deforestation increasing, agribusiness and power generation may collapse in Brazil.
The Amazon Forest works as a cooling system. On a single day, a robust tree with its 20-meter (66-foot) canopy pumps around 1,100 liters (290 gallons) of water into the atmosphere. These masses of air carrying vapor from the forest’s transpiration are called “flying rivers.” They take humidity from the Amazon Basin to Brazil’s center-west, southeast and south regions as well as to neighboring countries. With fewer trees in the forest, there is less humidity in the air. And that leads to drought.",https://news.mongabay.com/2020/08/deforestation-in-the-amazon-is-drying-up-the-rest-of-brazil-report/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,,"A severe drought in the Czech Republic, which has reached historic levels in its fifth year, is worrying growers as it increasingly hits agriculture.
Scientists say the current series of drought, which began in 2015, is the worst in 500 years.
The temperature spikes have hit hardest in the eastern regions of Moravia and Silesia and the dry spell has forced many farmers to adapt fast. Some have had to cut fruit and wine grape production by 40 per cent.
In Central Bohemia — also hit hard — one grower, Lubo? Hrabánek of Farma Zadní Kopanina, says he has restructured his land to deal with the conditions.
He’s using smaller tracts for growing than the traditional multi-hectare square sectors that date from the communist days.
Hrabánek runs a family farm in the Bohemian Karst area whose main activity is animal production and breeding cattle, pigs and chickens. His four 10-hectare tracts also produce alfalfa, cereals and sometimes corn feed for his animals.
Despite recent rains, which have helped somewhat, Hrabánek has been “strongly impacted by the drought”, he said.
“Long-term care and care of the soil is important. Maybe that's why we focus anxiously on the principle of regular crop rotation.”
Besides using ancestral methods, he said “we try to grow crops that are not very demanding on water. We have not yet had to resort to artificial irrigation”.
The farm’s strategy has allowed it to avoid produce price hikes so far. “Our goal is not to spew production at all costs,” says Hrabánek, adding that his operation tries to tailor production to local needs.
Another farmer in the region — who produces artisanal honey, beets and greens that he markets directly in Prague — says water scarcity has forced him to irrigate year-round.
“We’re one of the only farms in our area still growing vegetables,” he said, noting that pumping from wells gets harder every year. Tensions are growing with neighbouring farms as the water table falls, he added.
Makers of craft beer in the Czech Republic – a product increasingly in demand at home and abroad – say they’ve been watching the prices and availability of hops, the country’s most famous export.
A representative of Chroust craft beer says the company buys Bohemian hops for its prime lagers and has not yet seen prices rising but acknowledges “growers are being hit. It could happen at any time”.
Winter wheat is at risk, say many farmers, but corn, with deeper roots, has fared batter. Meanwhile, other crops are likely to be ploughed under, unless more rain arrives soon.
The drought has also harmed grass and alfalfa production, needed for cattle feed, notes Robert Ku?era of the Agrarian Chamber of Ostrava.
An agency set up to study the drought and provide data, Intersucho.cz, reports that the Moravian-Silesian Region is in “one of the worst situations” with extreme drought at levels not seen for the last 50 years.
Authorities are supplying some towns with water tanks this year as they did in 2019, as other add-on effects include the spread of bark beetles and Moravian winemakers planning for a future shift from white wine production to red grapes, which are less dependent on water.
As for the effects on consumers, it’s clear that grocery prices are up but less certain is what role the drought has played, said Patrik Rozumbersky of market analyst company UniCredit. Rising food prices have more likely been driven by effects of the coronavirus, which held up shipments of produce at the country’s borders. A shortage of agriculture workers, who were blocked from travelling to the country from the east, is also a likely culprit, according to Rozumbersky.
Grocery chains Billa and Albert declined to comment on price changes but Prague consumers did appear to bulk up on packaged goods, which may also have had an effect – though the Czech Republic did not see binge buying at the level witnessed in the UK and US during the COVID-19 lockdowns.
Consumer food price rises were also in line with current inflation reports showing a rate of 7.8 per cent, a rise from last year’s 6.4 per cent rate, according to Rozumbersky.
Czech crop prices, he adds, depend not just on local production levels but on “the quality of harvest in the whole European continent as the price of individual products is formed on the international market”.
At the same time, said Rozumbersky, “I think that the possible effect of drought might become more intensive later in the year as soon as the impact on the harvest is clearer.”
Industry organisations have been cautioning farmers too: the Czech Agricultural Chamber calls groundwater levels “strongly below normal overall,” noting that 71 per cent of wells are at unusually low water depths.
In addition, low water levels have hit key watersheds in the upper Oh?e, Lu?ická Nisa and Smědá river basins, which the chamber calls “strongly below normal.” Also drying up are natural springs, of which 79 per cent are suffering from “with severe or extreme drought”.",https://www.euronews.com/2020/05/05/historic-czech-drought-worries-growers-and-scientists,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,,"The water crisis along the California-Oregon border went from dire to catastrophic this week as federal regulators shut off irrigation water to farmers from a critical reservoir and said they would not send extra water to dying salmon downstream or to a half-dozen wildlife refuges that harbor millions of migrating birds each year.
In what is shaping up to be the worst water crisis in generations, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation said it will not release water this season into the main canal that feeds the bulk of the massive Klamath Reclamation Project, marking a first for the 114-year-old irrigation system. The agency announced last month that hundreds of irrigators would get dramatically less water than usual, but a worsening drought picture means water will be completely shut off instead.
The entire region is in extreme or exceptional drought, according to federal monitoring reports, and Oregon’s Klamath County is experiencing its driest year in 127 years.
“This year’s drought conditions are bringing unprecedented hardship to the communities of the Klamath Basin,” said Reclamation Deputy Commissioner Camille Calimlim Touton, calling the decision one of “historic consequence.” “Reclamation is dedicated to working with our water users, tribes and partners to get through this difficult year and developing long-term solutions for the basin.”
The canal, a major component of the federally operated Klamath Reclamation Project, funnels Klamath River water from the Upper Klamath Lake just north of the Oregon-California border to more than 130,000 acres (52,600 hectares), where generations of ranchers and farmers have grown hay, alfalfa and potatoes and grazed cattle.
Only one irrigation district within the 200,000-acre (80,940-hectare) project will receive any water from the Klamath River system this growing season, and it will have a severely limited supply, the Klamath Water Users Association said in a statement. Some other farmers rely on water from a different river, and they will also have a limited supply.
“This just couldn’t be worse,” said Klamath Irrigation District president Ty Kliewer. “The impacts to our family farms and these rural communities will be off the scale.”
At the same time, the agency said it would not release any so-called “flushing flows” from the same dam on the Upper Klamath Lake to bolster water levels downstream in the lower Klamath River. The river is key to the survival of coho salmon, which are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.

Farmers in south-central Idaho’s Wood River basin will face some of the biggest shortages, with an estimated 40 to 45 days before water from the Magic Reservoir runs out, according to David Stephenson, manager of Big Wood Canal Co. In a normal season, farmers might get water into late September.
Magic Reservoir, which supplies water to 36,000 acres of farmland, was only about a quarter full this year before dams were released last week, kicking off the season.
The reservoir holds water that flows through Big Wood River from melted snowfall in the mountains. The river is flowing at about 16% of its normal rate this year after record-low winter precipitation levels, Boise State Public Radio reported.
Prior to the winter, a dry summer and fall last year meant groundwater was already depleted as irrigators south of Bellevue pumped out of the aquifer, searching for any leftover moisture.
Carl Pendleton, a farmer who gets all of his water from Magic Reservoir, said the outlook is dismal.
“I sold my cow herd last week, the first time I’ve been out of livestock in my lifetime,” he said. “That’s the decisions we’re making based on this amount of water.”
The Idaho Department of Water Resources this spring could decide to curtail groundwater pumping to the north, which Pendleton said goes unchecked and exacerbates the shortages so that there isn’t enough to go around.

The models show drought is expected to keep its hold over the mountains along the New Mexico-Colorado border that feed the Rio Grande, while California, Nevada and other southwestern states aren’t likely to see a reprieve from dry conditions through June.",https://apnews.com/article/nv-state-wire-droughts-new-mexico-ut-state-wire-az-state-wire-bebb9c9af320e50ba199840406988b23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,,"A two-decade-long dry spell that has parched much of the western United States is turning into one of the deepest megadroughts in the region in more than 1,200 years, a new study found.
And about half of this historic drought can be blamed on man-made global warming, according to a study in Thursday’s journal Science.
Scientists looked at a nine-state area from Oregon and Wyoming down through California and New Mexico, plus a sliver of southwestern Montana and parts of northern Mexico. They used thousands of tree rings to compare a drought that started in 2000 and is still going — despite a wet 2019 — to four past megadroughts since the year 800.
With soil moisture as the key measurement, they found only one other drought that was as big and was likely slightly bigger. That one started in 1575, just 10 years after St. Augustine, the first European city in the United States, was founded, and that drought ended before the Pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock in 1620.
What’s happening now is “a drought bigger than what modern society has seen,” said study lead author A. Park Williams, a bioclimatologist at Columbia University.
Daniel Swain, a UCLA climate scientist who wasn’t part of the study, called the research important because it provides evidence “that human-caused climate change transformed what might have otherwise been a moderate long-term drought into a severe event comparable to the ‘megadroughts’ of centuries past.”",https://apnews.com/article/ut-state-wire-az-state-wire-id-state-wire-or-state-wire-nv-state-wire-d1f130f8826ef57c74db611e959937ac,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,,"Arizona is getting a jump start on what will be a yearslong process to address a dwindling but key water source in the U.S. West.
Several states and Mexico rely on the Colorado River for drinking water and growing crops. But climate change, drought and demand have taken a toll on the river that no longer can deliver what was promised in the 1920s.
Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, California, Utah, Wyoming and Nevada have been operating under a set of guidelines approved in 2007. Those guidelines and an overlapping drought contingency plan will expire in 2026.
Arizona water officials gathered Thursday to outline a plan for what comes next. Other states in the river basin have had more informal discussions.
“Hold on to your seats because the reconsultation will be technical and complicated, and it will take a long time,” said Ted Cooke, general manager of the Central Arizona Project, who is co-chairing Arizona’s effort.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation is reviewing the effectiveness of the 2007 guidelines that address shortages and surpluses of water, and efforts to conserve water in Lake Mead along the Nevada-Arizona border. A draft is expected in August, and a final report in December.
“It’s prudent water management to review how well something has worked before determining what might replace it,” said Carly Jerla of the Bureau of Reclamation.
When those guidelines went into effect, the river had been in drought conditions for several years. It hasn’t let up. A drought contingency plan approved by the Western states last year was meant as a stop-gap. It requires Arizona, Nevada and Mexico to prop up Lake Mead earlier than under the 2007 guidelines. It also looped in California for water cuts.
A Reclamation audit published last month found that water use in the Colorado River’s lower basin dropped by more than 575,000 acre-feet from 2018 to 2019, a level not seen since 1986. That allowed Lake Mead and Lake Powell — key indicators of the river’s health — to increase by several feet but both remain well below capacity.
As of this week, Mead was 41% full. Powell, along the Arizona-Utah line, was 53% full.
Arizona is looking to build upon the work done on the drought contingency plan. The committee of about three dozen people that worked it helps develop what might replace the existing guidelines, focusing on how to sustain the river while meeting the state’s water needs, officials said.",https://apnews.com/article/nv-state-wire-droughts-ut-state-wire-az-state-wire-ca-state-wire-2476176178f44b71aa92f5a4215405ba,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He has declared a state of emergency - the second in three years - over the situation, mobilising all government agencies to respond to the drought.
The lack of rain has already left 500,000 people - one in five Namibians - without access to enough food, the government says.
The sparsely-populated country has seen a succession of droughts since 2013.
The government had set aside 40m (30m) to buy food and water tanks, and to transport livestock to and from grazing areas.
Prime Minister Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila has appealed for international help.
""We... call on all Namibians and development partners to assist in any way possible, so that we provide to our people who are affected, as well as the livestock,"" she said in the national assembly.
At least 60,000 domestic animals have died in the past six months.
Those affected are facing severe food shortages following the prolonged drought, the prime ministers's office, which is coordinating the response, has said.
President Geingob blamed a poor rainy season, which is usually comes between January and March, for being behind the problem.
Rivers have dried up in the north of the country, and people are depending on food and water relief from the government, journalist Tuyeimo Haidula told the BBC.

The Golden State has experienced some form of drought for 376 consecutive weeks, the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska, tweeted. It’s the first time the state has been free of drought since Dec. 20, 2011.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration tweeted that weather in 2017 helped matters, but moderate drought persisted. Rainfall this winter further alleviated the drought, although 7 percent of the state remains ""abnormally dry.""
""The storms this year have really helped snowpacks, the reservoirs,"" said Jessica Blunden, a climatologist with NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information. Colder temperatures also helped prevent snow from melting off, she said.
This winter — the meteorological winter starts on Dec. 1 and ends at the end of February — has been the wettest in the United States as a whole since records started being kept in 1895, with an average across the nation of 9.01 inches, which is 2.22 inches above the nationwide average, Blunden said.
That precipitation has not just benefited California. ""It’s been a great winter for the West,"" she said.
The U.S. Drought Monitor website, which is an effort by several agencies including NOAA and the national drought mitigation center, says that well-above precipitation in the West helped build snow pack and fill reservoirs, and that normal conditions have returned to the Salton Sea in the southeastern part of the state.

4,,"Southern Africa is experiencing one of the worst droughts in years, with more than 40 million people expected to face food insecurity because of livestock and crop losses. Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Zimbabwe have declared it an emergency.
In semi-arid Botswana, the farmers are reeling after the worst drought in a decade wiped out entire harvests and left the land littered with dead livestock.
Two thirds of the crops planted last season failed, while Ngamiland, a rich beef producing region, has recorded nearly 40,000 cattle deaths.
Rancher Casper Matsheka says there was no food or water, so his animals starved to death.
“The goats died, as well as the cattle, as you can see the carcasses all over. We were really affected. If only the government could subsidize the prices of feed and vaccines for the livestock during such times,” he said.
Nor has the drought sparred wildlife.
National parks authorities have resorted to feeding starving hippos while hundreds of elephants have died.
Environmental nongovernment organization, Kalahari Conservation Society’s Neil Fitt says competition for food and water has increased the risk of human-wildlife conflict.
“The livestock are now putting pressure on the wildlife areas, so the wildlife are also getting pressure on their areas, and that is where the conflict zone is,” he said. “Why I am bringing this up? The... interconnected with the drought is this wildlife-human conflict.”
In Botswana, where drought is frequent, President Mokgweetsi Masisi said the government plans to stop calling it an emergency and instead make drought relief part of the national budget.
“Government has taken a decision to develop a Drought Management Strategy, which would classify drought as a permanent feature in our budget plans, rather than an emergency,” he said. “The strategy will be completed before the end of the financial year.”
Acting director of Meteorological Services Radithupa Radithupa says a robust strategy is needed to deal with the recurring droughts.

4,,"The severe drought that struck California from 2011 to 2015 had an obvious impact on rivers, forests, and wildlife. Now, a new study shows it also had some surprising effects on the state’s notorious air pollution, adding new wrinkles to the state’s efforts to clear the skies.
Researchers have long known that plants can both help create and cleanse one dangerous air pollutant: ground-level ozone, which causes breathing problems and exacerbates lung damage. Plants can scrub ozone from the air by absorbing the pollutant through their stomata, or pores. But certain plants also emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that react with other atmospheric chemicals to create ozone.
Understanding how drought influences these two processes can be tricky. Dry conditions could cause ozone levels to rise, because plants shrink their stomata to prevent water loss, reducing their ability to remove pollution. But drought might also reduce ozone levels, because the stress could cause plants to produce fewer ozone-forming VOCs.
California’s lengthy drought, and the state’s extensive network of air pollution sensors, gave researchers a rare opportunity to see what happens in the real world. The team, led by atmospheric chemistry Ph.D. candidate Angelique Demetillo and environmental science professor Sally Pusede at the University of Virginia (UVA) in Charlottesville, examined more than a decade’s worth of satellite and sensor data that documented atmospheric conditions over Bakersfield and Fresno, two California cities that suffer from ozone pollution.
The drought’s impact on air quality changed over time, the researchers report this week in Environmental Science & Technology. Plants did remove less ozone, with absorption dropping by about 15% during the most severe years of the drought. But during the early years of the drought, trees and other plants were able to maintain their production of one key ozone-forming VOC, isoprene. The chemical helps plants like oak trees withstand heat stress, and it appears the trees draw on carbon stores to sustain isoprene production. “It’s like a person exercising; when you’ve burned through your recent consumption the body switches over and starts burning fat,” says Manuel Lerdau, an organismal ecologist at UVA and a co-author of the study.
After about 4 years of drought, however, the stress took its toll. In 2013, plant isoprene levels fell dramatically, by 65% in Bakersfield and 54% in Fresno. Overall, that meant up to a 20% dip in ozone pollution. And even after the drought ended, isoprene levels didn’t immediately rebound.
The plant VOC reduction might sound like good news for reducing California’s smog. But the complexity of atmospheric chemistry means droughts could actually complicate clean air efforts. That’s because, currently, regulations mostly focus on controlling nitrogen oxides (NOx) from sources like cars and factories, which react with VOCs to form ozone. When VOC levels are higher, those NOx controls help choke off smog-creating reactions. But reduce the VOCs, and NOx limits go from “being very effective to less effective,” Pusede says.
Such findings offer yet another complication for U.S. states and cities struggling to meet federal clean air standards, especially in drought-prone western states. Regulators have little ability to control VOC emissions from plants, notes Pusede, and “I don’t know if we’d want to even if we could.” But the study could help regulators do a better job of factoring drought into their air pollution models.
The work also “provides a road map for better quantifying these impacts in other places,” says atmospheric scientist Jessica Neu of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, who reviewed the paper. And because much of the needed data can now be collected by satellites, she says it opens the door to investigating “drought impacts on air quality globally.”",https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/04/drought-not-just-about-water-it-affects-air-pollution-too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,,"About 42% of India’s land area is facing drought, with 6% exceptionally dry--four times the spatial extent of drought last year, according to data for the week ending March 26, 2019, from the Drought Early Warning System (DEWS), a real-time drought monitoring platform.
Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Maharashtra, parts of the North-East, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Telangana are the worst hit. These states are home to 500 million people, almost 40% of the country’s population.
While the central government has not declared drought anywhere so far, the state governments of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Odisha and Rajasthan have declared many of their districts as drought-hit.
“Before monsoon, which is still far away, the next two or three months are going to be difficult in many of these regions,” Vimal Mishra, associate professor at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Gandhinagar, and the developer of DEWS, told IndiaSpend.
Failed monsoon rains are the primary reason for the current situation. The North-East monsoon, also known as ‘post-monsoon rainfall’ (October-December) that provides 10-20% of India’s rainfall, was deficient by 44% in 2018 from the long-term normal of 127.2 mm, as per data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD). This compounded the rainfall deficit in the South-West (SW) monsoon (June-September) that provides 80% of India’s rainfall, which fell short by 9.4% in 2018--close to the 10% deficit range when the IMD declares a drought.
India has experienced widespread drought every year since 2015, Mishra said, with the exception of 2017. As the El Nino--the unusual warming of the equatorial Pacific Ocean that makes Indian summers warmer and reduces rainfall--looms over the 2019 SW monsoon, pre-monsoon showers (March-May) this year have also been deficient. India has received 36% less rainfall than the long-term average between March 1 and March 28, 2019, as per IMD data. The southern peninsular region recorded the lowest, a deficit greater than 60%.
Lower rainfall has reduced water levels in reservoirs across the country. The amount of water available in the country’s 91 major reservoirs has gone down 32 percentage points over five months to March 22, 2019. In 31 reservoirs of southern states, water level has gone down by 36 percentage points over five months.
The drought could further worsen farm distress, exacerbate groundwater extraction, increase migration from rural to urban areas, and further inflame water conflicts between states and between farms, cities and industries.
Yet, the latest drought manual issued in 2016 by the central government makes the process of declaring drought long and difficult, experts say, with the result that drought may go officially unannounced. This means relief measures such as drinking water supply, subsidised diesel and electricity for irrigation, increased number of days of insured work under National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) are not taken. And elections may further delay government acknowledgement and action.

Among the hardest hit areas is South Africa’s Northern Cape province, where many farmers are struggling to keep their families and animals alive while revenue falls and debt piles up.

Some animals died of hunger. Others were sent prematurely to the slaughterhouse to reduce the number to feed. With tears running down his face, Van der Merwe said he now relies on donations of animal feed so the rest can survive.
“If we didn’t have hope, we would not be here anymore,” he said. “We have to have hope and faith. There are a couple of times when we have felt it is not worth it.”
Two of his fellow farmers have killed themselves due to the stress, Van der Merwe said.
Northern Cape province will need over 28 million in drought relief over the next three months to assist 15,500 affected farms, according to farmers’organization Agri-SA.

Preliminary analysis of MRC’s data has shown that the draught is caused by insufficient rainfall during the wet season with a delayed arrival and earlier departure of the monsoon rain and an El Nino event that has created an abnormally high temperature and high evapotranspiration. 
During a normal year, the monsoon rain usually starts in late May and ends in October. But this year, it began almost two weeks late and departed about three weeks earlier. 
“This year’s prolonged dry weather condition can possibly adversely impact agricultural and crop production. The issue of water shortages for consumption could also come into play as the drought persists,” said Dr. Lam Hung Son, the MRC Secretariat’s Head of Regional Flood and Drought Management Center, who led the analysis.  
Using a three-month timeframe, the analysis looked at both the probability and degree of drought and rainfall occurrences compared with historical data called the standardized precipitation index (SPI), and the degree of dryness of the top soil layer known as the combined drought index (CDI) in the four MRC Member States: Lao PDR, Cambodia, Thailand and VietNam.

4,,"Drought is a pretty complicated climate extreme to define. Most commonly, it is defined as a precipitation deficit - much less precipitation falls than what is typically expected for a given time period.
But drought can be observed in lots of ways: lack of snowpack, low flows in rivers and streams, dry soils, higher evaporative losses, low lake/reservoir levels, etc. Because the climate varies all the time, it’s a safe assumption to say that all areas experience drought similarly because all areas will see times when precipitation is (or the other water variables) less than average.
But drought is not equally distributed across the U.S. Just as there are climatologically wetter areas and drier areas across the country, the same could be said about the occurrence, frequency, and severity of drought.
So, some might be asking, ""where are the most 'drought-prone' areas?

4,,"A potent combination of record-breaking heat and a lack of rain has led to the rapid development of drought across the southeastern United States and Tennessee and Ohio Valleys during September 2019. Coming off an extremely wet 2018 east of the Rockies, the fast onset of widespread extensive drought has been quite the climate whiplash for millions across the Southeast.  With warmer than average temperatures expected to continue and October being a generally dry month based on climatology, drought conditions are likely to continue and possibly expand and intensify over the next week.
The extent to which drought has overtaken the southeastern United States by the end of September would have been hard to explain to residents of the region just a month prior.  While a few localized areas in Georgia/Alabama were already mired in drought, the broader region extending into the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys was drought free. In fact, the twelve-month period (September 2018-August 2019) coming to an end was record wet. But then, while it continued to be hot, things turned incredibly dry.
The rapid onset and severity of the event qualified it as a “Flash drought.” Generally, droughts are caused by a lack of precipitation over an extended period of time. In contrast, a flash drought is preceded not just by a lack of rain, but also very high temperatures and/or lots of sunny days. Even if the dry period is not especially severe, the latter two can suck moisture from the ground quickly.

Southern Africa has received normal rainfall in just one of the past five growing seasons, which particularly hits the small-scale farmers who depend on rain for their crops, the U.N. World Food Program said last week. The U.N. food agencies plan to distribute emergency food aid to 11 million people in the coming months.
Two cataclysmic cyclones hit Mozambique, Zimbabwe and other southern African countries early this year, wiping out crops of maize and other staple crops. Without normal rainfall, subsistence farmers are hard-pressed to recover from the destruction caused by the tropical storms.

The city’s 4.6 million citizens are rationing every drop of water, restaurants are closing early and companies are scaling back their operations as Chennai tries to survive a heat wave with 99 per cent less water than it had at the same time last year. The state government is shipping in water on trucks, but those trucks can’t replace the now dried-up lakes that once fed the city.
Everyone is asking the same question: When will the monsoons start?
Satellite footage released earlier this month shows the city’s four reservoirs, including nearby Lake Puzhal, have severely shrunk since last June. The reservoirs have a capacity of 318.8 billion litres, but they are down to a collective 651 million litres, according to government data reported by the Hindustan Times. The reservoirs have been reduced to 0.2 per cent of their capacity, according to state government data.
The city typically relies on the heavy rainfall of monsoon season to replenish its water supply, which comes from four lakes and groundwater reservoirs in the region. The monsoons usually start in June but they’ve been delayed this year, leaving citizens with little water amid blistering temperatures that exceed 40 C each day.

4,,"A recent JRC article warns that the extreme drought conditions that affected central and northern Europe's 2018 spring/summer growing season could become the norm within 25 years, and calls for innovative adaptation measures to deal with extremes.
The 2018 spring and summer months were marked by a unique combination of drought conditions in central and northern Europe, and unusually wet conditions in southern Europe.
For instance, Germany was affected by a 6-month drought which lasted the whole spring and summer, while the spring was particularly wet in the Iberian Peninsula.
Both extremes affected crop yields. The droughts resulted into total reductions in the main crop yields of up to 50%.
This was partially offset by southern Europe's yield gains of up to 34%.
This juxtaposition of opposite climate anomalies  – droughts in the Northern part of Europe and unusually wet condition in the South, sometimes referred to as the ""water seesaw"" – was  a unique phenomenon of the last 500 years.
 Future climate projections, based on high resolution global models, show that southern Europe is less likely to experience such favourably wet conditions for crop growth in the future.

4,,"A severe drought is plaguing east China's Anhui Province, leaving crops damaged and drinking water supplies disrupted in some of the hardest-hit regions, local authorities said on Friday.
From Aug. 12 to Oct. 28, the province received an average rainfall of 83.9 milliliters, 60 percent less than the amount in normal years and hitting the second-lowest level since 1961, according to the provincial meteorological department.
A total of 45 cities and counties have been ravaged, with regions in three cities along the Yangtze River suffering from the worst drought in up to 50 years, said the provincial emergency management department.
The drought has affected over 1 million residents and damaged 400,000 hectares of crops, inflicting a direct economic loss of 1.6 billion yuan (227 million U.S. dollars), it said.
The provincial meteorological authority has been using cloud seeding for artificial rain as no precipitation is forecasted in the coming week in most of Anhui.

4,,"Alaska’s wettest region is experiencing an extreme drought for the first time in recorded history, climate scientists say.
The southernmost portion of Southeast Alaska, including Ketchikan, Prince of Wales Island, Wrangell and Metlakatla, has been in a drought for the last two years, said Rick Thoman, a climatologist at the Fairbanks-based Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy.
Last week, though, the drought was updated to a D3, or “extreme” drought, the second-highest category the U.S. Drought Monitor measures. It’s the first time those conditions have ever been recorded in Alaska, according to the Drought Monitor.
Meanwhile, areas experiencing lesser “severe” and “moderate” droughts on the Panhandle have expanded, the Drought Monitor said.
Droughts look different in the rainforest climate of Southeast Alaska than elsewhere in the world, though, with the key difference being that the region is still getting quite a lot of precipitation by most standards, Thoman said.
Ketchikan has averaged about 100 inches annually since 2017, and Metlakatla has seen between 80 and 90, climatologists say.
“In the mass amount of the world that would be an immense amount of rain,” Thoman said.
However, that’s still drastically less than what’s normal for the region. Ketchikan normally averages 150 inches of precipitation a year, and Metlakatla 118. This year, Ketchikan has seen about 5 inches less precipitation than it normally does by this time of year, according to data from the National Weather Service.",https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/weather/2019/05/26/in-southeast-alaska-is-seeing-its-first-extreme-drought-ever-recorded-climatologists-say/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That made headlines in the local media, because it was the first time since August 17, 2018, that anyone had seen a drop of rain in this region, the epicentre of the drought that is now afflicting almost half of India.
Two days earlier, Sakharam Landge was ploughing his farm near Umarkheda village in Jalna district. It was 42 degrees Celsius in the shade, a hot wind was blowing away the topsoil his tractor churned up, and he was not sure he would be able to sow any crop this summer. “But what else can I do,” he said. “My grandfather, my father, all the elders in the village said we must plough our farms in the first half of June, so that we can sow our Kharif (summer) crop as soon as the rains arrive on June 15.”
A farmer in his early forties, Landge is perfectly aware that the monsoon rains have not been arriving on June 15 in recent years. Of the 18 summer monsoons this millennium in Marathwada – a region where the overwhelming majority of farmers have no irrigation facilities – ten have caused droughts and one a flood. As the monsoon winds bring rainfall from the Arabian Sea to India’s west coast, Marathwada is also in the rain shadow of the Western Ghats – a mountain chain along the coast – and has always been a low rainfall area.
However, it is also home to the famously productive ‘black cotton soil’ of the Deccan Plateau. In a good rainfall year, cotton and soybean – the two staple crops of the region in recent decades – bring enough money to see an average farming family through for the next couple of years as well. But apart from 2016, no one has any recent memory of a good rainfall year in this region with a population of about 18.7 million people, most of whom are farmers.",https://www.eco-business.com/zh-hans/news/surviving-indias-drought-people-have-stopped-expecting-a-decent-life/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within this, ‘severe to exceptionally dry conditions’ prevailed in 17.33 per cent area, according to the real-time drought monitoring platform.
While just 0.65 per cent of area had ‘exceptionally dry’ conditions in June 2018, it has now jumped to 5.87 per cent, stated the latest data.
Further, the delay in southwest monsoons has worsened the drought index, the DEWS reported.
In the June 6 update, real-time platform recorded 43.02 per cent area under ‘abnormally to exceptionally dry’ conditions. However, the latest data showed an increase (44.17 per cent). 
Similarly, percentage of area under ‘extremely dry to exceptional dry’ increased from 10.83 to 11.22 per cent during the same period.
India has witnessed the second-driest pre-monsoon season in the last 65 years. The country received 99 millimeters (mm) rainfall between March and May — with 23 per cent below the normal rainfall during this time of the year —, showed the latest data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD).
The deficit is prevalent across the country with south India having a deficit of 47 per cent, followed by northwest India (30 per cent), central India (18 per cent), and east and northeast (14 per cent).
The month of June, which accounts for 18 per cent of rain, may end up with a deficit of 40 per cent in at least 66 districts across the country, warned Skymet Weather, a private weather forecasting agency.
The low rainfall would be difficult to make up for the deficit in coming months, it noted.
According to the IMD, there is also a possibility of weaker monsoon in July. It could be a great cause of worry, as the month is crucial and receives one third of the total monsoon rains in the country. 
The sluggish pace of the south west monsoon has compounded the severe dry spell. As a result, at least 30 sub-divisions are likely to experience ‘deficient’ and ‘largely deficient’ monsoon season, the IMD said.
Most of these are in Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, and the north eastern states. Only four sub-divisions in Karnataka, Gujarat, and Lakshadweep have witnessed ‘normal’ rainfall.
Low rainfall has also contributed to a downward trend in water levels in at least 71 of 91 reservoirs across India, a recent bulletin by the Central Water Commission (CWC), has showed.

That report includes Arizona, as this year’s abnormally wet May helped push the state out of a 10-year drought period.
According to the monitor’s weekly report for late last week, only 20.5% of Arizona was showing moderate drought or “abnormally dry” symptoms. Data for the same week in 2018 found 100% of the state in moderate drought or abnormally dry, with a majority of the state experiencing severe (97%) or extreme drought (73.2%).
Richard Heim, a meteorologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Centers for Environmental Information, said the change was tied to this year’s wet spring.
“Rain and snow have been falling in the areas that needed it, so the drought’s contracted a lot,” he said.
Arizona is no stranger to downpours in the monsoon season, which runs June 15 to Sept. 30, according the National Weather Service, but heavy rain and snowfall in spring isn’t typical for the Southwest.

Charity Save the Children says drought and war in Somalia has led to unprecedented numbers fleeing across the border into Kenya, with about 1,300 people arriving every day.
Three camps at Dadaab, just inside Kenya, are home to well over 350,000 people, but they were built to hold just 90,000 and are severely overcrowded.
A prolonged failure of rains, which began in late 2010, is now taking its toll.
The UN's Office for the Co-Ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) warns that the situation is continuing to deteriorate, and the number of people in need will continue to increase.
The numbers now affected are huge, Ohca says: 3.2m in Ethiopia, 3.2m in Kenya, 2.6m in Somalia and more than 100,000 in Djibouti.
Every month during 2011, about 15,000 Somalis have fled their country, arriving in Kenya and Ethiopia, according to Ocha.
While conflict has been a fact of life for them for years, it is the drought that has brought them to breaking point. Many have walked for days, are exhausted, in poor health, desperate for food and water.

High levels of acute malnutrition are widespread and more than 8 million people in Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia are in need of emergency assistance.
The region has now experienced two consecutive seasons of significantly below-average rainfall, resulting in failed crop production, depletion of grazing resources and significant livestock mortality.
Chronic crisis
""The current crisis is not an unusual or chance event, but rather a chronic feature of the region. The challenge ahead is to empower farmers and pastoralists to adapt to the new realities of high variability of weather patterns and more frequent extreme weather events,"" said Rod Charters, Regional Emergency Coordinator for Eastern and Central Africa.
""Together with our partners of the Regional Food Security and Nutrition Working Group we have been preparing for this drought scenario since the failure of last year's short rains. FAO issued various alerts and has been supporting countries' preparedness plans in the Region.""
In Somalia, malnutrition rates are amongst the worst in the world, with one in four children in southern Somalia acutely malnourished. The drought is affecting most parts of the country, leading to livestock deaths and sky-rocketing food prices which make it increasingly difficult for poor families to feed themselves.
Currently, 2.5 million people – one in three Somalis – are in need of humanitarian assistance but with the ongoing conflict in the South, coupled with the poor outlook for the upcoming harvest, many more Somalis may fall into severe crisis.
In Kenya, more than 2.4 million people in the pastoralist and agropastoralist areas of northern and northeastern regions are estimated to be unable to meet their basic food and water needs. The food security situation is expected to further deteriorate as milk production in the drought-affected areas has collapsed and will not recover until October when the short rains are expected to start.
Furthermore, distances to water have doubled to 30-40 kms in many areas and conflicts have occurred over grazing resources, leading to loss of human lives and livestock, along with constrained market access. Emergency interventions are urgently required to mitigate the impact and protect further livelihood and nutritional deterioration.
In Ethiopia, a La Ni?a episode has resulted in the failure of two consecutive seasons of rain, water shortages, very poor pasture and marked deterioration in livestock conditions resulting in much reduced livestock prices in south and southeastern lowlands. In Borena Zone, on the southern border with Kenya, 220 000 cattle deaths have been reported. 
Additionally, the drought has also affected the 2011 ""belg"" cropping season to be harvested in June/July, which is expected to be very poor in the Oromia, Tigray, Ahmara and SNNP (Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples) regions.
At the beginning of June the number of people requiring assistance in Ethiopia was estimated at 11.4 million.  This includes 3.2 million people in need of emergency assistance and the 8.2 million people registered under the productive safety net programme.
In Djibouti, the ongoing drought coupled with very high staple food prices, high unemployment and increased rural-urban migration has worsened the food security situation at the household level. Water shortages in Djibouti City are also expected to become a serious issue over the coming months as the peak demand for water approaches.",http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/80157/icode/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,,"The United Nations refugee agency said today that with the increasing gravity of the situation in Somalia, where hundreds of thousands of people are suffering because of drought and conflict, it was stepping up assistance with aid distributions across the country’s central and southern parts.
Adrian Edwards, a spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), told a news briefing in Geneva that “although access remains a serious impediment, working with partners on the ground in Somalia we have so far distributed assistance packages to some 90,000 people in Mogadishu and Belet Hawa and Dobley in southwest Somalia.”
The agency is handing out non-food aid for an estimated 126,000 people in other parts of the Gedo and Lower Juba region to the west, with assistance also on its way to Mogadishu and the Afgooye corridor just west of Mogadishu, as well as further southwest in the Lower Shabelle area, Mr. Edwards said.
The agency is strengthening its mechanisms for tracking population movement and protection monitoring in the corridors leading to the Dolo Ado and Dadaab refugee camps in Ethiopia and Kenya respectively.
“Our aim is that through shorter interval reporting we’ll be better able to inform emergency interventions,” Mr. Edwards said. “UNHCR is the primary provider of this information to UN agencies and NGOs operating in Somalia.”
“Given the very serious health state of many refugees arriving at camps in neighbouring countries, UNHCR believes it is of life-saving importance that people in Somalia are able to get help where they need it,” he said. “This may, in certain circumstances, mitigate the necessity to cross borders into neighbouring countries, where refugee camps were already bursting at the seams.”
UNHCR continues to look at all means to step up its efforts inside the country, he said.",https://news.un.org/en/story/2011/07/381982,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,,"In some areas of Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia and Uganda, drought conditions are the worst in 60 years, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in an update.
Almost half the of children arriving in refugees camps in Ethiopia from southern Somalia are malnourished, while 11 districts in Kenya have reported malnutrition rates above the 15 per cent emergency threshold. Supplementary and therapeutic feeding programmes are struggling to keep pace with the rising needs, according to OCHA.
Drought-related displacement and refugee flows are on the rise, with an average of 15,000 Somalis arriving in Kenya and Ethiopia every month this year seeking assistance.
“While conflict has been a fact of life for them for years, it is the drought that has taken them to breaking point. Many have walked for days, are exhausted, in poor health, desperate for food and water, and arriving in a worse condition than usual,” according to the OCHA update on the drought situation in the region.
The influx of Somalis into refugee camps in the Dadaab area of Kenya’s North-Eastern province – the largest refugee settlement in the world – has led to worsening overcrowding amid limited resources.
The drought has forced children out of school as both human and livestock diseases spread. Competition for the meagre resources is causing tensions among communities.
The price of grain in drought-affected areas of Kenya is 30 to 80 per cent more than the five-year average, according to OCHA, while in Ethiopia, the consumer price index for food increased by almost 41 per cent last month. Further food price hikes area expected in Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda and Somalia, but could ease after the next harvests expected later this year.
OCHA called for the scaling up of the emergency response in all affected areas, urging governments, donors and relief agencies step up efforts to prevent further deterioration.
Further funding is also required to enable humanitarian agencies to provide the necessary assistance. UN agencies and the partners this year requested 529 million for Somalia, but only 50 per cent of that amount has been received.
In Kenya, where 525 million is required, about 54 per cent of that money has been obtained so far. The appeal for Djibouti is for 39 million, but only 30 per cent has been received.",https://news.un.org/en/story/2011/06/379982-millions-facing-severe-food-crisis-amid-worsening-drought-horn-africa-un,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,,"Djibouti is one of the smallest countries on the African continent. Situated between Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia, the total population is approximately 820,000 people. These factors alone make it an easy country to overlook in the context of the current drought. Next to the emergency crises in Kenya and Somalia, the needs of the drought-affected population may seem insignificant. Yet this is not a sufficient reason to neglect Djiboutians who are asking for help.
The IFRC together with the Djibouti Red Crescent have been undergoing an assessment throughout the country, and the needs are quite real. In Garabtisan village, northern Djibouti, there are approximately 1500 people - including 300 children - who have been facing a drought for the past five years.
“There is no public school for our children”, explained Madina, a mother of nine children. “We used to have a Koranic school, but the last wind storm knocked down the tree where lessons took place. Now, there is no place for children to learn.” It is a symbolic loss for this community who are on the brink of an emergency crisis.
In Garabtisan village, women such as Madina have only 40 litres of water for a period of 2 to 3 days to support the needs of an entire family. The nearest water source requires that women walk the distance of 23km, or they wait for water delivery from the military stationed nearby. But with a community of 1500 people, it is simply impossible for the military to adequately service the needs of Garabtisan village without support. In addition to high food prices, geographical isolation and the depletion of livestock, their situation is increasingly desperate.
Access to health care is another critical problem for women and children in Garabtisan village. When a child falls ill, the community is unable to respond. Each month there are approximately 6 to 7 births, with a loss of 2 to 3 children. The mobile health clinic provided by the Ministry of Health faces significant logistical challenges to reach the community as needed.
Yet the people of Garabtisan have dignity. Their cultural traditions practice basic hygiene such as washing children’s hands before eating, or defecating away from the home. Madina clearly wants to be a good mother, and meet the basic needs of her children.
The Djibouti Red Crescent and IFRC recognise the clear needs in drought-affected areas such as Garabtisan village. The Government of Djibouti has claimed there are 120,000 in need of critical assistance in rural areas. This indicates that 1 out of 8 persons are in need of emergency aid.
However the response cannot be successful by one agency or government ministry alone. Joint action is needed in Djibouti, in order to meet the challenges of drought-affected communities. Although the figures may be comparatively small to the rest of the Horn of Africa, women and mothers in desperate need, such as Madina, should be enough to take action.",https://www.ifrc.org/ar/news-and-media/news-stories/africa/djibouti/drought-takes-hold-in-djibouti/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,,"The latest famine in Somalia has put a spotlight on the urgent need to develop national and regional drought policies, according to the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, which are jointly leading the international action to address the growing impact of droughts.
Drought is expected to continue in hard-hit southern Somalia during August and September, as well as parts of Ethiopia, Djibouti and Kenya, according to the latest WMO Climate Outlook Forum for the region, which provides regional climate forecasts. The IGAD Climate Prediction and Applications Centre (ICPAC) already called for preparedness for an ongoing long period of drought over parts of the equatorial region in its climate update for the Greater Horn of Africa on 15 January 2011.
Droughts have become more common over the past two decades. This is consistent with reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, stating that the world has become more drought-prone over the last 25 years, and will see an increased frequency of droughts in the future.
""Droughts do not happen overnight,"" said Luc Gnacadja, Executive Secretary of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), responding to the declaration of famine by the United Nations earlier this month. ""The UNCCD joins the calls on the international community to respond urgently to this crisis. At the same time, we stress the need for effective, long-term solutions to the root causes of famine in drought-prone regions, such as implementation of drought management systems and measures to stop desertification, which means land degradation in drylands.""
""We are moving forward quickly to provide integrated drought information to help decision-makers deal with drought, such as the one underway right now in East Africa,"" said Michel Jarraud, Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization. ""Drought is a serious and growing problem in many countries. Adaptation to drought, desertification and climate change urgently needs to be mainstreamed in national development policies.""
Mr Gnacadja visited Mr Jarraud at WMO earlier this month to discuss cooperation between the two organizations, following the UN declaration of famine for two provinces in southern Somalia on 13 July 2011. The two organizations have a long-standing partnership. Most recently they have championed the use of the Standard Precipitation Index, as a universal meteorological drought index to improve monitoring and climate risk management among countries.",https://www.unccd.int/news-events/ten-million-people-risk-east-africa-faces-worst-drought-60-years-wmo-unccd-action,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,,"More anthills than blades of grass are visible in some of the cracked earth around Junction. The year-long drought has plagued the town — as it has the rest of the state — and for a painful, six-week stretch, Junction banned all outdoor watering.
Some 4.5 inches of rain earlier this month increased the flow of the Llano River, two forks of which meet at the town. But the water is still pretty low — and four panelists at the Texas Water Symposium last week brought some unwelcome news to the townspeople: It’s not going to get any better anytime soon.
“As the state climatologist, people ask me, ‘When’s it going to rain?’” said John Nielsen-Gammon, one of the panelists, who is a professor of meteorology at Texas A&M University and the state's climatologist.
The answer, according to Nielsen-Gammon, is “eventually,” but chances are the drought will last another year, possibly even another decade.
The weather, or lack thereof, can be attributed to La Nia, a cyclical weather pattern resulting in cooler waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Meteorologists say that although La Nia had faded by the summer, it has now returned and is strengthening.
In the past 12 months, Texas has seen 11.1 inches of rainfall on average, according to Nielsen-Gammon, and it broke a heat record for the country that was previously set during the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. Texas AgriLife Extension Service estimates the cost of the drought to be about 5.2 billion, and that estimate — already out of date because it was compiled two months ago — doesn’t include the impact to several kinds of crops and the forestry industry.
Junction, known as the land of living waters, has seen some of its streams dry up. In August, town officials say, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality told Junction to cease outdoor water use of any kind when the town of Llano downstream reported it was close to running out of water.",https://www.texastribune.org/2011/10/18/more-months-drought-ahead-texas/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,,"In the cattle town of Emory in East Texas, the worst drought in state history is threatening a way of life. Scorching temperatures and a lack of rain have forced many ranchers to sell off their stock.
Normally before being brought to market, cattle are penned in a rancher's best pasture to be fattened. The heavier the cow, the more the buyer pays.
But the animals at a recent Emory auction look pitiful. They're standing in 107-degree heat — that's in the shade — with their ribs showing, stressed out. It's been like this for the past nine weeks — no rain. Although these cows were bred for the heat, they weren't bred for this. They look absolutely baked.
If this were a normal year, an August cattle auction in Emory would see maybe 100 to 200 head. There are more than 700 head today. And that's down from the more than 1,000 head sold here every Tuesday for much of this summer. The sad truth is, East Texas is starting to run out of stock to sell.
Inside the auction room, buyers in jeans and cowboy hats, here from Michigan and Wisconsin, Tennessee and Alabama, raise their fingers in front of their chests to bid. One cow, one calf, one bull after another, until late into the night. The Lone Star State is emptying itself of its cattle.
Stanley Austin is a rancher and a commission-order buyer, which means he buys livestock for farmers and feed yards. He has seen the drought's effects up close, at his family's ranch.
""We've had that place in our family for 75 years,"" he says, ""and it's never been without water. It's been without water now since about the 15th of June.""
Austin travels throughout Texas, going to seven livestock sales each week. He says the drought is going to alter the state's rural economies forever.",https://www.npr.org/2011/08/26/139947317/drought-puts-texas-ranchers-and-cattle-at-risk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,,"The United Nations’ food agency issued an alert on Tuesday warning that a severe drought was threatening the wheat crop in China, the world’s largest wheat producer, and resulting in shortages of drinking water for people and livestock.
China has been essentially self-sufficient in grain for decades, for national security reasons. Any move by China to import large quantities of food in response to the drought could drive international prices even higher than the record levels recently reached.
“China’s grain situation is critical to the rest of the world ? if they are forced to go out on the market to procure adequate supplies for their population, it could send huge shock waves through the world’s grain markets,” said Robert S. Zeigler, the director general of the International Rice Research Institute in Los Ba?os, in the Philippines.
The state-run news media in China warned Monday that the country’s major agricultural regions were facing their worst drought in 60 years. On Tuesday the state news agency Xinhua said that Shandong Province, a cornerstone of Chinese grain production, was bracing for its worst drought in 200 years unless substantial precipitation came by the end of this month.
World wheat prices are already surging, and they have been widely cited as one reason for protests in Egypt and elsewhere in the Arab world. A separate United Nations report last week said global food export prices had reached record levels in January. The impact of China’s drought on global food prices and supplies could create serious problems for less affluent countries that rely on imported food.
With 2.85 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, nearly three times that of Japan, the country with the second-largest reserves, China has ample buying power to prevent any serious food shortages.",https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/09/business/global/09food.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Texas state officials are planning now how to evacuate several endangered species at risk because of the record drought. The state is home to 86 threatened species.
Parched skies and relentless 100 degree heat are turning this summer into one of the worst in history here. Joggers run in the early morning before the heat intensifies; people working in downtown Houston seek shelter in the city's underground tunnel system rather than venturing out on the scorched city sidewalks. Football players practice in the morning to beat the heat, and children spend recess in air conditioned gyms at school.
The heat has driven wildlife into the open -- one homeowner southwest of Houston, who was wondering what was happening to his disappearing watermelon crop, set up a camera, and snapped a photo of a coyote in his backyard, stealing a watermelon.

Preliminary reports from the National Climatic Data Center indicate that July 2011 was the warmest month ever recorded statewide for Texas, with data going back to 1895, Nielsen-Gammon reports. The average temperature of 87.2 degrees broke the previous record of 86.5 degrees set in 1998. The June average temperature of 85.2 was a record for that month and now ranks fifth warmest overall.
Rainfall totals were also unusually light across the state. The July monthly total of 0.72 inches ranks third driest, surpassed by the 0.69 inches recorded in both 1980 and 2000. This is the fifth consecutive month in which precipitation totals were among the 10 driest for that month, says the Texas A&M professor.
Among the other rainfall records set this month: least year-to-date precipitation (6.53 inches; historical average 16.03 inches; previous record 9.36 inches in 1917); driest consecutive 8, 9 and 10 months on record (7.25 inches 8.35 inches, and 9.17 inches respectively); and driest 12 months ending in July (15.16 inches, previous record 16.46 inches in 1925).",https://today.tamu.edu/2011/08/04/texas-drought-officially-the-worst-ever/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,,"The drought and the massive displacement of people in the Horn of Africa, in addition to conflict and violence, high food prices, and dwindling resources, has resulted in one of the most dramatic global humanitarian crises.
According to the latest reports by the World Food Programme, some 10 million people are affected by the Horn of Africa's worst drought in 60 years.
Two consecutive rainy seasons have failed, producing a decline of more than 25% of rain for pastoral areas in Somalia, Northern and Eastern Kenya, Southern and Eastern Ethiopia and Djibouti. As a result harvests have failed, livestock mortality has soared, and food and water have become extremely expensive.
The price of food for essential cereals like maize has increased 2,5 times in Eastern Kenya, Eastern Ethiopia and Southern Somalia. Millions of people in the region cannot meet basic survival needs, and emergency levels of acute malnutrition are widespread.
In most areas affected by the drought, malnutrition is affecting over 30% of people, which is more than double the internationally recognized emergency threshold. Those who can are leaving their land and their homes to walk long distances trying to find food and water. Many Somalis are crossing borders to do that. An estimated 3,000 people a day are arriving in Kenya and Ethiopia from Somalia in search for a help.
The crisis is expected to worsen over the coming three to four months. ""If we don't act now, famine will spread to all eight regions of southern Somalia within two months, due to poor harvests and infectious disease outbreaks,"" told Mark Bowden, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Somalia. 
Recovery is not expected until next year, given the expected late and below-average harvests, the depletion of pasture and water and the high prices of food, water, and fuel. This is why the rapid scaling-up of the emergency response is vital to address the humanitarian needs and to prevent further deterioration.",https://africa-eu-partnership.org/en/stay-informed/news/worst-drought-60-years-horn-africa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
