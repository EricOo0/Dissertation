earthquake,"A magnitude 6.4 earthquake has struck Argentina's west-central province of San Juan on Monday night, according to a preliminary report from the United States Geological Survey.
A series of aftershocks around the country followed. A magnitude 5.0 aftershock struck 27 kilometers (about 16.8 miles) south-southwest of Nueve de Julio, around 1,000 km (620 miles) east of the first quake and almost 20 minutes later.
Then, a magnitude 4.9 quake came in the same area as the first, followed by a magnitude 5.3 aftershock.
The 4.9, 5.0 and 5.3-magnitude quakes are considered aftershocks as they are smaller in magnitude than the main quake and in the same area.
No injuries have been reported so far, according to San Juan Governor Sergio U?ac. Based on available data, there is no tsunami threat at this time, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC).
Speaking at a press conference early Tuesday, U?ac said local authorities are still analyzing the damage, which impacted streets and highways in the province. Some locations experienced power cuts, and homes experienced damage in the town of Caucete. Four people had to be evacuated from their homes in the town of Zonda, in San Juan.
The governor added that the electricity service is now gradually being reestablished. No public buildings have been damaged; some hospitals reported broken glass, but experienced no major structural damage.
U?ac urged people to stay calm after the quakes hit. ""Let's put into practice all the measures that we have learned to prevent incidents, while we are committed to knowing the impact of the (earthquake) to collaborate in everything necessary,"" he tweeted.
He added that the province was working with civil and security forces to respond, as well as with municipalities to respond to ""take care of them.""
In its preliminary statement, the PTWC recorded the depth of the quake at about 20 kilometers (12.43 miles)."
earthquake,"A series of massive earthquakes have struck north-east Japan, unleashing a 10-metre tsunami that swept buildings, vehicles, crops and debris across swaths of farmland.
The first 8.9 magnitude shock is said to be the biggest to have hit Japan in 140 years, rocking buildings 235 miles (380km) away in Tokyo and sparking fires.
At least five people are known to have died, but amid widespread reports of landslides, floods, collapsed buildings and fires, the death toll is expected to rise.
The quake hit at 2.46pm (5.45am GMT), about 6 miles below sea level and 78 miles off the east coast. It was swiftly followed by five powerful aftershocks of up to 7.1 magnitude. In Tokyo people screamed and grabbed each other's hands as the quake struck. The shock was so powerful it was felt as far away as Beijing."
drought,"A recent JRC article warns that the extreme drought conditions that affected central and northern Europe's 2018 spring/summer growing season could become the norm within 25 years, and calls for innovative adaptation measures to deal with extremes.
The 2018 spring and summer months were marked by a unique combination of drought conditions in central and northern Europe, and unusually wet conditions in southern Europe.
For instance, Germany was affected by a 6-month drought which lasted the whole spring and summer, while the spring was particularly wet in the Iberian Peninsula.
Both extremes affected crop yields. The droughts resulted into total reductions in the main crop yields of up to 50%.
This was partially offset by southern Europe's yield gains of up to 34%.
This juxtaposition of opposite climate anomalies  – droughts in the Northern part of Europe and unusually wet condition in the South, sometimes referred to as the ""water seesaw"" – was  a unique phenomenon of the last 500 years.
 Future climate projections, based on high resolution global models, show that southern Europe is less likely to experience such favourably wet conditions for crop growth in the future.
On the other hand, droughts similar to those of 2018 could become common as early as 2043."
wildfires,"Large wildfires raging throughout California have claimed at least 44 lives statewide, destroyed thousands of structures and prompted hundreds of thousands to evacuate. A fire actively burning in Northern California took at least 42 lives, becoming the deadliest fire on state record.
Large fires have scorched populated areas of California over the past week, including the Camp Fire, north of Sacramento, which incinerated the entire town of Paradise, and the Woolsey Fire, which burns northwest of Los Angeles. Firefighters on Monday also battled the Rocky Peak fire, which sprung up near where the Woolsey fire began and forced the shutdown of the Route 118 freeway. The Camp Fire has become one of California’s most destructive fires in at least a century, according to the Associated Press.
Wildfires are a natural and annual occurrence in California, typically appearing toward the end of the long, dry summers. In four out of five cases, people provide the igniting spark. At the same time, the environment has also become more flammable. As the state grows hotter and increasingly subject to prolonged droughts, and as more people live in high risk areas, the fires simply get bigger, more severe and more costly to put out."
drought,"An estimated 45 million people are threatened with hunger by a severe drought strangling wide stretches of southern Africa.
Emergency food deliveries are planned for parts of South Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe and other countries hard hit by a combination of low rainfall and high temperatures.
“We are witnessing millions of already poor people facing extreme food insecurity and exhausting their reserves because of compounding climate shocks that hit already vulnerable communities hardest. They need help urgently,” said Nellie Nyang’wa, southern Africa director for the international aid agency, Oxfam.
“The scale of the drought devastation across southern Africa is staggering.”
Parts of Zimbabwe have had the lowest rainfall since 1981, contributing to making more than 5.5 million at risk of extreme food insecurity, Oxfam said in a report released Thursday.
Zambia’s rich maize-growing area has been hit hard and exports are now banned; 2.3 million people there are food-insecure, according to Oxfam and the Zambia Red Cross. The drought is also worsening food availability in Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, Madagascar and Namibia, Oxfam said.
Southern Africa has received normal rainfall in just one of the past five growing seasons, which particularly hits the small-scale farmers who depend on rain for their crops, the U.N. World Food Program said last week. The U.N. food agencies plan to distribute emergency food aid to 11 million people in the coming months.
Two cataclysmic cyclones hit Mozambique, Zimbabwe and other southern African countries early this year, wiping out crops of maize and other staple crops. Without normal rainfall, subsistence farmers are hard-pressed to recover from the destruction caused by the tropical storms.
“The successive mixture of drought and flooding has been catastrophic for many communities. In most of the affected areas there isn’t enough drinking water, which means that people and animals — both livestock and wildlife — are having to use the same water points,” said Kaitano Chungu, Secretary General of the Zambia Red Cross.
“This is unacceptable as it exposes people to diseases and creates a heightened risk of animal attacks.”
Some families in the worst-affected areas are surviving the food shortage by eating wild fruits and roots, Chungu said.
The drought has also affected the region’s wildlife. At least 105 elephants have died in Zimbabwe as a result of lack of water and vegetation, according to Zimbabwe’s National Parks."
earthquake,"At 12.51 p.m. on Tuesday 22 February 2011, a magnitude 6.3 earthquake caused severe damage in Christchurch and Lyttelton, killing 185 people and injuring several thousand.
The earthquake’s epicentre was near Lyttelton, just 10 km south-east of Christchurch’s central business district. It occurred nearly six months after the 4 September 2010 earthquake.
The earthquake struck at lunchtime, when many people were on the city streets. More than 130 people lost their lives in the collapse of the Canterbury Television and Pyne Gould Corporation buildings. Falling bricks and masonry killed another 11 people, while eight died in two city buses that were crushed by crumbling walls. Rock cliffs collapsed in the Sumner and Redcliffs area, and boulders tumbled down the Port Hills, with five people killed by falling rocks.
Although not as powerful as the magnitude 7.1 earthquake on 4 September 2010, this earthquake occurred on a shallow fault line close to the city, so the shaking was particularly destructive.
The earthquake brought down many buildings damaged the previous September, especially older brick and mortar buildings. Heritage buildings that suffered heavy damage included the Provincial Council Chambers, Lyttelton’s Timeball Station, the Anglican Christchurch Cathedral and the Catholic Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament. Two-thirds of the buildings in the central business district were subsequently demolished, including the city’s tallest building, the Hotel Grand Chancellor.
Liquefaction was much more extensive than in September 2010. Shaking turned water-saturated layers of sand and silt beneath the surface into sludge that squirted upwards through cracks. Thick layers of silt covered properties and streets, and water and sewage from broken pipes flooded streets. House foundations cracked and buckled, wrecking many homes. Irreparable damage necessitated the demolition of several thousand homes, and large tracts of suburban land were subsequently abandoned, with 8,000 properties bought by the government and razed."
earthquake,"An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 struck off southern Alaska's coast late Tuesday, shaking the Alaska Peninsula and briefly sparking tsunami concerns before officials said no destructive waves were coming.
The earthquake was centered in the Pacific Ocean about 60 miles southeast of Perryville on the sparsely populated Alaska Peninsula, striking around 10:12 p.m. local time (2:12 a.m. Wednesday ET).
The Alaska Peninsula protrudes from mainland Alaska and is flanked to the southwest by the Aleutian Islands.
Reports of significant damage, if any, weren't immediately available. A tsunami warning initially was issued for south Alaska and the Alaska Peninsula, but was canceled by early Wednesday, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The warning sent people to higher ground in cities like Sand Point, an island community of about 1,000 people off the peninsula, the Anchorage Daily News reported.
People in Sand Point gathered at a high school until shortly after midnight, when officials gave an all-clear, Jordan Keeler, an Anchorage-based city administrator, told the newspaper.
""The first wave didn't materialize, which is a great thing,"" Keeler, who was in contact with staff in Sand Point, told the Anchorage Daily News. No reports of major structural damage were made on the island, Keeler told the newspaper.
""We've canceled the (tsunami) advisories because it doesn't look like it's becoming a large wave or any larger,"" National Tsunami Warning Center Director James Gridley said, according to CNN affiliate KTUU.
Strong shaking was reported on the peninsula, the USGS said. Light to weak shaking was reported around Kodiak, about 300 miles northeast of the quake's center, and in Anchorage, some 530 miles from the center, according to the USGS.
In Kodiak, a city of about 6,000 people, a long line of cars headed up a mountain after residents learned of the tsunami warning late Tuesday, John Cannon told KTUU.
Police were ""trying to clear the lower areas down by the harbor,"" he said.
""You (could) hear the tsunami alarms. It's rather eerie,"" he told KTUU.
This quake's depth was 28 kilometers, or 17 miles, the USGS said -- relatively shallow.
""Anything below 70 kilometers is considered a shallow quake,"" CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar said. ""That's important, because shallow earthquakes often cause the most damage, compared to the ones that are deeper, regardless of the strength.""
More than 20 aftershocks followed the quake late Tuesday to early Wednesday, ranging from magnitudes of 2.8 to 6.1."
earthquake,"An intermediate magnitude 5.2 earthquake was reported in the evening near Madang, Madang Province, Papua New Guinea.
According to Indonesia's Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysical Agency, the quake hit on Thursday 13 May 2021 at 9:32 pm local time at an intermediate depth of 72 km. The exact magnitude, epicenter, and depth of the quake might be revised within the next few hours or minutes as seismologists review data and refine their calculations, or as other agencies issue their report.
Our monitoring service identified a second report from the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) which listed the quake at magnitude 5.2 as well. A third agency, the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ), reported the same quake at magnitude 5.0.
Based on the preliminary seismic data, the quake should not have caused any significant damage, but was probably felt by many people as light vibration in the area of the epicenter.
Weak shaking might have been felt in Goroka (pop. 18,500) located 39 km from the epicenter, Madang (pop. 27,400) 69 km away, and Kainantu (pop. 8,500) 77 km away.
VolcanoDiscovery will automatically update magnitude and depth if these change and follow up if other significant news about the quake become available. If you're in the area, please send us your experience through our reporting mechanism, either online or via our mobile app. This will help us provide more first-hand updates to anyone around the globe who wants to know more about this quake."
earthquake," A 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck Saturday off the coast of Antarctica, with authorities issuing a tsunami warning for Chile's Eduardo Frei base on the frigid continent, emergency officials said.
The quake struck at 8:36 pm (2336 GMT) about 210 kilometers (130 miles) east of the base at a depth of 10 kilometers (6 miles), Chile's National Emergency Office (Onemi) said, urging evacuation from ""the beach area of the Antarctic"" ahead of a possible tsunami.
The Chilean Air Force's base is the country's largest in Antarctica, and includes a village, hospital, school, bank, post office and chapel.
The maximum population in summer is 150 people, and the average population in winter is 80.
An unrelated 5.9-magnitude earthquake struck near Santiago on Saturday night, but Onemi said no significant damage or impact was reported.
Chile is one of the most seismically active countries in the world. A 8.8-magniture temblor in the city of Concepcion on February 27, 2010 left more than 500 dead.
The country suffered the most powerful earthquake ever recorded 60 years ago -- measuring 9.6 magnitude -- in the city of Valdivia."
earthquake,"On 15 January 2021, a 6.2 magnitude earthquake hit Majene, West Sulawesi Province in the early hours of the morning killing at least 81?people, injuring more than 630, and over 15,000 homeless.
More than 15,000 people have been temporarily displaced in 15 IDP sites, and figures are increasing.
The quake severely damaged buildings and houses, including a hospital that was completely flattened, trapping dozens of patients and staff in the rubble. Preliminary assessments indicate that 17 schools have been damaged.
Heavy rains in recent days have made access very difficult, blocking the main road to the affected areas.
The first priority is to search for survivors who have been trapped under the rubble, and to tend to the wounded.
This disaster comes nearly two and a half years after a massive earthquake and tsunami killed thousands in Central Sulawesi. Indonesia sits within the Pacific Ring of Fire, the world’s most disaster-prone area marked by floods, tsunamis and earthquakes."
drought,"Rivers ravaged by a lengthy drought may not be able to recover, even after the rains return. Seven years after the Millennium drought baked southeastern Australia, a large fraction of the region’s rivers still show no signs of returning to their predrought water flow, researchers report in the May 14 Science.
There’s “an implicit assumption that no matter how big a disturbance is, the water will always come back — it’s just a matter of how long it takes,” says Tim Peterson, a hydrologist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. “I’ve never been satisfied with that.”
The years-long drought in southeastern Australia, which began sometime between 1997 and 2001 and lasted until 2010, offered a natural experiment to test this assumption, he says. “It wasn’t the most severe drought” the region has ever experienced, but it was the longest period of low rainfall in the region since about 1900.
Peterson and colleagues analyzed annual and seasonal streamflow rates in 161 river basins in the region from before, during and after the drought. By 2017, they found, 37 percent of those river basins still weren’t seeing the amount of water flow that they had predrought. Furthermore, of those low-flow rivers, the vast majority — 80 percent — also show no signs that they might recover in the future, the team found."
drought,"Over the past two years, drought has severely affected much of Brazil. According to a bulletin from the National Center for Monitoring and Alerts on Natural Disasters (Cemaden), an agency of the Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovations and Communications, rainfall has been below historical averages in the center-west, south and part of the southeast regions of the country, including in the state of S?o Paulo.
The phenomenon became more evident in 2012. “Severe drought started in the northeast and lasted almost seven years,” says Cemaden researcher Adriana Cuartas. “Then, in 2014, water supply was in critical conditions in the Greater S?o Paulo area. Now the focus of concerns turns to the south, where rainfall has been below average for almost two years.”
Scientist Ant?nio Donato Nobre, author of the report “The Future Climate of Amazonia,” is emphatic: “South America is drying up as a result of the combined effects of deforestation and climate change.”
Low precipitation has an immediate impact on agriculture. The next affected are water supply and power generation. Water levels in the reservoirs of several dams have been low, including Itaipu, the world’s second-largest hydroelectric power plant. “The water that comes from the rivers to the reservoir is below the minimum level recorded in 1993. It’s a critical situation,” Cuartas says. “The Itaipu basin is used not only for power generation, but also for water supply.”
Recent rains in the south may bring temporary relief to agriculture, but water conditions take time to return to normal. “Rainfall would have to be at average levels or above for several months for the water system to start recovering and resume expected levels,” Cuartas says.
Agribusiness has been suffering losses as a result of drought, but it also contributes to the changes in the water regime. Deforesting the Amazon to establish cattle ranches, plantations and logging reduces precipitation in Brazil and other Latin American countries. With deforestation increasing, agribusiness and power generation may collapse in Brazil.
The Amazon Forest works as a cooling system. On a single day, a robust tree with its 20-meter (66-foot) canopy pumps around 1,100 liters (290 gallons) of water into the atmosphere. These masses of air carrying vapor from the forest’s transpiration are called “flying rivers.” They take humidity from the Amazon Basin to Brazil’s center-west, southeast and south regions as well as to neighboring countries. With fewer trees in the forest, there is less humidity in the air. And that leads to drought."
Typhoon,"Hong Kong may have to brace for a typhoon slamming its large container port this weekend.
A cluster of thunderstorms over the Philippines has the potential to become a typhoon during the next couple of days. This would be the second named storm of the 2020 Pacific typhoon season. The first was Typhoon Vongfong, known as Typhoon Ambo in the Philippines, which hit that island nation in May. The season runs throughout the year, but most Pacific typhoons develop from May through October.
This storm, which would be named Typhoon Nuri, will likely track over the northern Philippines on Friday, June 12, moving into southeastern China over the weekend. The projected track takes the storm close to Hong Kong on Sunday, June 14.
The potential typhoon could delay various services, from container cargo to cruises and public transportation.
Hong Kong is one of the busiest container ports in the world, according to the Hong Kong Maritime and Port Board website. It handled 18.3 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) of containers in 2019, and provided about 300 container liner services per week connecting to around 420 destinations worldwide.The Port of Hong Kong is also home to cruise liners and government fleets, and it operates ferries between Hong Kong and mainland China."
earthquake,"A magnitude 5.9 earthquake has struck southwestern Iran along the Persian Gulf.
There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries from the temblor Sunday.
Iranian state television alerted on its broadcast, saying it was a 5.9 magnitude. A second aftershock quake of 4.5 magnitude followed it.
The US Geological Survey called it a 5.8 magnitude earthquake, located at the port city of Bandar Genaveh. It described its depth at 10 kilometers (6.2 miles).
A magnitude 5 earthquake can cause considerable damage. Such shallow earthquakes as Sunday's also have broader damage.
That's some 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant.
Iran is on major seismic faults and experiences one earthquake a day on average. In 2003, a magnitude 6.6 earthquake flattened the historic city of Bam, killing 26,000 people.
A magnitude 7 earthquake that struck western Iran in 2017 killed more than 600 people and injured more than 9,000."
Typhoon,"Heavy rain and a cyclonic storm are likely at several places in the western parts of India, warned the India Meteorological Department (IMD) in its latest weather forecast on Thursday. The stormy weather is due to a low pressure area over the Arabian Sea. According to the IMD, this is likely to intensify into a cyclonic storm by May 16, and some places in Goa and south Konkan region may see very heavy rainfall. ""A low pressure area has formed over the southeast Arabian Sea and adjoining Lakshadweep area today. It is very likely to become well marked over Lakshadweep area by Friday morning,"" the weather office said. The conditions may result in a depression by Saturday morning and intensify into a cyclonic storm in the next 24 hours. Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani has asked officials of the coastal districts to take necessary safety measures."
Typhoon,"Hundreds of people have been rescued after Hurricane Sally – which has since transformed into a tropical storm – made landfall in Alabama and Florida on Wednesday morning.
The storm arrived as a Category 2 hurricane in Gulf Shores, Alabama, around 4.45am with 105mph winds and rain depths in the feet, not inches, flooding homes and streets – as people were forced to evacuate from the southern coast.
Some areas have already been hit with 24 inches of rain, and a total of 35 inches could come in parts of Florida and Alabama, according to the National Weather Service. Why specific areas were getting hammered with high rains was due, in part, to how slowly the storm was moving. It was traveling at just 7mph up the coastal states.
First responders used boats and high water vehicles in parts of Florida and Alabama to rescue hundreds of trapped residents while Hurricane Sally transformed into a tropical storm, with winds decreasing to 70mph.
The rescues came after some of the areas hit the hardest were not issued mandatory evacuations. Residents were encouraged to voluntarily leave, but some people still stayed behind in their homes.
“At one point we were grabbing things to evacuate because the water was starting to get up to the second level and then by that point it was too late for us to go anywhere,"" Kirsten Colla, who lives in a townhouse on Escambia Bay in Pensacola, Florida, told weather.com."
wildfires,"Portuguese fire-fighters are battling just one wildfire after some 650 firefighters managed to contain two other fires blazing in the country’s north since Friday, rescue services said yesterday.
More than 500 fire-fighters and 75 soldiers used over 100 vehicles, three helicopters and a waterbombing plane to contain a fire raging in Sao Pedro do Sul, in the Viseu region, civil defence services said on its website.
Three people suffered slight injuries on Saturday and a fireman was killed on Monday when a truck transporting him, rolled over.
Another fire raging since Friday in Tabuaco, also in the Viseu area, was contained by 150 fire-fighters, 40 vehicles and two helicopters.
Civil defence services said firefighters were now battling only one “significant” fire, burning since Saturday near the national park of Peneda-Geres in the northwest region of Braga."
earthquake,"A powerful earthquake of magnitude 6.3 struck in Tajikistan on Friday with tremors felt across North India and Delhi, prompting people to rush out of their homes.
The epicentre of the earthquake was in Tajikistan - about 450 km from Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir, according to India's National Center for Seismology.
The earthquake struck at 10:31 pm IST at a depth of 74 km from the surface.
Strong tremors were felt in Delhi and surrounding areas for several seconds.
""Earthquake tremors felt in Delhi. Praying for everyone's safety,"" Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted.
There was no immediate report of any damage to life or property.
Strong tremors were also felt in Amritsar and Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh's spokesperson said he spoke to the police commissioner."
drought,"At least 200 elephants have died in Zimbabwe’s largest national park amid a severe drought.
Since October, the giant creatures have been found in Hwange National Park, although other parks have also been affected by the drought.?
Other species including giraffes, buffalos and impalas are also dying and the situation will only improve once rain returns, said Tinashe Farawo, a spokesperson for Zimbabwe National Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (Zimparks).
“Almost every animal is being affected,” he said. “Of course, elephants are easily noticed during patrols or game drives, but some bird species are seriously affected because they can only breed in certain tree heights and those trees are being knocked down by elephants.”
Many animals are straying from Zimbabwe’s parks into nearby communities in search of food and water.
Zimparks said 33 people have died from conflict with animals this year.
The drought has also taken its toll on crops, leaving more than half of the population in need of food aid.
The agency said it plans to move 600 elephants, two prides of lions and other animals from the Save Valley Conservancy in the south east of the country to less congested parks.
A pack of wild dogs, 50 buffalos, 40 giraffes and 2,000 impalas will also be relocated, Mr Farawo said."
Typhoon,"The US Midwest will be hit with blizzards and gale-force winds this week, forecasters have said, as a powerful storm threatens to trigger more flooding in the region.
High spring temperatures are today expected to give way to heavy snow and life-threatening conditions across a swath of the central US.
Patrick Burke, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service (NWS), warned that the storm could cause widespread power outages and road closures.
“This is potentially a life-threatening storm,” he told Reuters. “It’s slow moving. It won’t push farther east until Friday.”
The storm has already sparked flood evacuations in Oregon and caused flooding in Washington state.
Some areas of western Minnesota and southeast South Dakota are likely to experience up to 30 inches snow.
The same region is still recovering from last month’s ‘bomb cyclone’ which brought deadly flooding and blizzards, causing billions of dollars in damage.
The NWS said that the coming storm is likely to exacerbate flooding along the Missouri River in areas where dozens of levees were breached in March.
The storm is expected to weaken and push off into the Great Lakes area and northern Michigan on Friday, bringing more rain and snow, forecasters said."
earthquake,"At least 65 people have died and more than 100 are missing after a powerful earthquake struck the southern New Zealand city of Christchurch, collapsing buildings, burying vehicles under debris and sending rescuers scrambling to help people trapped under rubble.
The 6.3-magnitude quake struck the country's second largest city on a busy weekday afternoon.
The mayor of Christchurch, Bob Parker, has declared a state of emergency and ordered people to evacuate the city centre. ""Make no mistake this is going to be a very black day for this shaken city,"" he said.
Power and water was cut and hundreds of dazed, screaming and crying residents wandered through the streets as sirens blared throughout Christchurch in the aftermath of the quake, which was centred three miles from the city. The US Geological Survey said the tremor occurred at a depth of 2.5 miles."
Typhoon,"A storm called Potential Tropical Cyclone Six is expected is expected to bring rain and life-threatening flash flooding to the Cabo Verde Islands in the eastern Atlantic. The storm could strengthen into a hurricane by Sunday.
It has already been determined that it will be named Tropical Storm Florence as it gathers pace - becoming the seventh named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season.
The latest advisory for the storm — released at 7am Central time — said that the storm was 190 miles east-southeast of the southernmost point of those islands, and was moving at 12mph.
Compared to the types of major storms that have walloped American shores in the past, the as-of-yet-unnamed storm is relatively weak — clocking in with winds of 35 mph — but the system is expected to strengthen over the next week and may be classified as a hurricane in the coming days.
That said, tropical storm warnings remain in effect for Cabo Verde Islands Santiago, Fogo, and Brava, where residents can expect the potential for heavy rain and gusty winds later on in the day.
Where it goes from there is hard to predict — storms are fickle things and often change direction — but the hurricane centre’s long-range tracker pegs it as moving on a west to northwest path in the coming days. Early next week, the storm is likely to be far from the United States mainland."
Typhoon,"A tropical storm is gathering strength and is expected to become a hurricane by the time it hits Puerto Rico.
A state of emergency has been declared in the US territory as residents prepare for Dorian to bring the first hurricane of the season.
The National Hurricane Centre said the storm already has sustained winds of up to 50mph and is forecast to strengthen over the next 48 hours.
Officials have also issued tropical storm warnings for Martinique, St Lucia, and St Vincent and the Grenadines.
Barbados was hit by strong winds, rain and thunder and lightning on Monday night as Dorian passed, and residents were urged to remain indoors amid reports of power cuts.
The storm appeared to have caused little damage, however home affairs minister Edmund Hinkson urged residents to remain vigilant, adding: “We are not out of danger yet.”
By Tuesday morning the storm was about 30 miles southeast of St Lucia, blowing sustained winds of up to 50mph.
Officials warned it could become a hurricane by the time it passes the southwest side of Puerto Rico on Wednesday.
Hundreds of people in Puerto Rico have been stocking up on supplies at supermarkets and fuel stations in preparation for the storm."
drought,"Some parts of the Horn of Africa have been hit by the worst drought in 60 years, the UN says.
More than 10 million people are thought to be affected across the region.
The UN now classifies large areas of Somalia, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Kenya as a crisis or an emergency.
Charity Save the Children says drought and war in Somalia has led to unprecedented numbers fleeing across the border into Kenya, with about 1,300 people arriving every day.
Three camps at Dadaab, just inside Kenya, are home to well over 350,000 people, but they were built to hold just 90,000 and are severely overcrowded.
A prolonged failure of rains, which began in late 2010, is now taking its toll.
The UN's Office for the Co-Ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) warns that the situation is continuing to deteriorate, and the number of people in need will continue to increase.
The numbers now affected are huge, Ohca says: 3.2m in Ethiopia, 3.2m in Kenya, 2.6m in Somalia and more than 100,000 in Djibouti.
Every month during 2011, about 15,000 Somalis have fled their country, arriving in Kenya and Ethiopia, according to Ocha.
While conflict has been a fact of life for them for years, it is the drought that has brought them to breaking point. Many have walked for days, are exhausted, in poor health, desperate for food and water.
The UN refugee agency is dealing with the exodus.
A new refugee camp primarily for Somalis was opened at Kobe in Ethiopia last Friday, near an existing camp at Melkadida.
More than 3,500 refugees and their belongings were moved there over the weekend.
The UNHCR says this is the sixth camp for Somalis in Ethiopia, which is currently housing some 130,000 displaced people.
Food prices have risen substantially across the region, pushing many moderately poor households over the edge.
The price of grain in affected areas in Kenya is 30-80% above average.
The spokeswoman for Ocha, Elizabeth Byrs, said appeals for Somalia and Kenya, each about 525m (328m), are barely 50% funded, while a 30m appeal for Djibouti has raised just 30% of the needed funds."
Typhoon,"MANILA — Super Typhoon Goni, the world's most powerful storm in four years, crashed through the Philippines on Sunday, smashing buildings, toppling trees, and causing floods and mudslides. At least 10 people were reported dead as of Monday morning.
Peak winds were estimated at 195 mph early Sunday before Goni slammed into Catanduanes Island, home to more than 260,000 people. Those winds, equivalent to those of a strong Category 5 hurricane, made the storm comparable to Super Typhoon Haiyan, the catastrophic cyclone that devastated Tacloban City in the Philippines in 2013 and killed more than 6,000 people. The winds were similar to those of Typhoon Meranti, which struck the Philippines in 2016.
Goni landed in a country already reeling from two typhoons in the past two weeks, the coronavirus pandemic, a recession and a record unemployment rate this year."
drought,"“I once rescued a friend from drowning when he was swept away by the force of the current as we were swimming in the Diyala river,” says Qasim Sabti, a painter and gallery owner in Baghdad.
“That was 50 years ago,” he recalls. “I went back there recently and the water in the Diyala is so shallow today that a man could walk across it with his dog.”
The rivers of Iraq, above all the Tigris and Euphrates, are drying up. The country is becoming more arid, and desertification is eating into the limited amount of agricultural land.
Dams built upriver in Turkey, Syria and Iran since the 1970s have reduced the flow of water that reaches Iraq by as much as half and the situation is about to get worse.
“On 1 July, Turkey will start filling the Ilisu dam on the Tigris and this will cause another decline in the inflows to our country of about 50 per cent,” Hassan Janabi, minister of water resources, told The Independent.
He says that Iraq used to get 30 billion cubic metres of water a year from the Euphrates, but now “we are happy if we get 16 billion cubic metres”.
As Iraq begins to recover from 40 years of wars and emergences, its existence is being threatened by the rapidly falling water levels in the two great rivers on which its people depend.
It was on their banks that the first cities were established cities 8,000 years ago and where the flood stories of Gilgamesh and the Bible were first told.
Such floods are now a thing of the past – the last was in 1988 – and each year the amount of water taken by Iraq’s neighbours has been rising."
