Typhoon,"The tiny Caribbean island of Barbuda has been devastated by Hurricane Irma, the most powerful Atlantic Ocean storm recorded in history.
Around 90% of the nation’s structures and vehicles have been destroyed, killing at least one person, Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne said.
Irma passed over Barbuda early on Wednesday as a Category 5 hurricane.
The storm has left a trail of destruction across the eastern Caribbean, leaving at least eight people dead in total.
“Barbuda is literally rubble. The entire housing stock was damaged. It is just a total devastation,” Mr Browne told local news station ABS.
He said the island was “barely habitable” and the damage caused by the 185mph winds was “unprecedented”.
Around 60% of Barbuda’s 1,600 residents have been left homeless, Mr Browne said.
A two-year-old child was killed as a family tried to escape a damaged home during the storm."
earthquake,"An earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 struck south of the Philippine capital early on Wednesday, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said.
The agency said aftershocks could be expected, but the earthquake, which struck at a depth of 112 km (69.6 miles), was unlikely to cause damage.
""Because this is deep, a large area experienced the quake,"" Renato Solidum, head of Phivolcs, told DZMM radio station, adding there was no threat of a tsunami.
The earthquake's epicentre was in Mindoro province and it was felt in the capital, Manila.
The Southeast Asian country is on the geologically active Pacific Ring of Fire and experiences frequent earthquakes, particularly in the south."
wildfires,"SYDNEY (BLOOMBERG) - Australia is in the grip of deadly wildfires burning across the country, triggering an emotive debate about the impact of climate change in the world's driest-inhabited continent. The unprecedented scale of the crisis, and images of terrified tourists sheltering on beaches from the inferno, have shocked many Australians.
With summer only just beginning and the nation affected by a prolonged drought, the authorities fear the death toll will continue to mount as more homes and land are destroyed. Here are some key details of the crisis:
How many people have died?
Since the fire season began months ago during the southern hemisphere winter, 23 people have died. With six people missing in Victoria state, the authorities fear the death toll will rise. Among the fatalities are volunteer firefighters, including a young man who died when his 10-tonne truck was flipped over in what officials have described as a ""fire tornado"". Australia's worst wildfires came in 2009 when the Black Saturday blazes left 180 people dead."
earthquake,"A magnitude 5.6 earthquake struck southwest Iran near the town of Sisakht on Wednesday evening and at least 10 people were injured, state television said.
""People in Sisakht and the town of Yasuj left their homes in panic. Water and electricity have been cut off in Sisakht,"" a local official in the province of Kohgiluyeh and Boyer Ahmad told the TV.
""Rescue teams and ambulances have been dispatched to the area...So far 10 people have been injured.""
The state news agency IRNA said the quake, felt in several cities and towns in the region, struck at a depth of 10 km (6 miles) at 10:05 p.m. local time (1835 GMT).
""There are still no reports of fatalities,"" IRNA said.
Iran is crisscrossed by major geological fault lines and has suffered several devastating earthquakes in recent years."
drought,"Arizona is getting a jump start on what will be a yearslong process to address a dwindling but key water source in the U.S. West.
Several states and Mexico rely on the Colorado River for drinking water and growing crops. But climate change, drought and demand have taken a toll on the river that no longer can deliver what was promised in the 1920s.
Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, California, Utah, Wyoming and Nevada have been operating under a set of guidelines approved in 2007. Those guidelines and an overlapping drought contingency plan will expire in 2026.
Arizona water officials gathered Thursday to outline a plan for what comes next. Other states in the river basin have had more informal discussions.
“Hold on to your seats because the reconsultation will be technical and complicated, and it will take a long time,” said Ted Cooke, general manager of the Central Arizona Project, who is co-chairing Arizona’s effort.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation is reviewing the effectiveness of the 2007 guidelines that address shortages and surpluses of water, and efforts to conserve water in Lake Mead along the Nevada-Arizona border. A draft is expected in August, and a final report in December.
“It’s prudent water management to review how well something has worked before determining what might replace it,” said Carly Jerla of the Bureau of Reclamation.
When those guidelines went into effect, the river had been in drought conditions for several years. It hasn’t let up. A drought contingency plan approved by the Western states last year was meant as a stop-gap. It requires Arizona, Nevada and Mexico to prop up Lake Mead earlier than under the 2007 guidelines. It also looped in California for water cuts.
A Reclamation audit published last month found that water use in the Colorado River’s lower basin dropped by more than 575,000 acre-feet from 2018 to 2019, a level not seen since 1986. That allowed Lake Mead and Lake Powell — key indicators of the river’s health — to increase by several feet but both remain well below capacity.
As of this week, Mead was 41% full. Powell, along the Arizona-Utah line, was 53% full.
Arizona is looking to build upon the work done on the drought contingency plan. The committee of about three dozen people that worked it helps develop what might replace the existing guidelines, focusing on how to sustain the river while meeting the state’s water needs, officials said."
Typhoon,"Hurricane Irma is the strongest Atlantic basin hurricane ever recorded outside the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. It lasted as a hurricane from August 31 until September 11. The storm, which stretched 650 miles from east to west, affected at least nine US states, turning streets into rivers, ripping down power lines, uprooting trees and cutting off coastal communities.
On September 6, Hurricane Irma left a string of small Caribbean islands devastated. The eye of the hurricane passed over Barbuda, damaging about 95% of the buildings on the island.
The hurricane hit southwest Florida on September 10, battering the state's lower half and leaving a trail of tornadoes and storm-surge flooding as its core slowly moved inland.
The massive storm triggered evacuation orders for 5.6 million people before it made two landfalls.
On Monday, Irma was downgraded to a tropical storm as it lumbered through Georgia to parts north.
By Tuesday, Irma had left a trail of deadly devastation throughout the Southeast, flooding major cities including Jacksonville, Florida, and Charleston, South Carolina, and leaving millions without power."
earthquake,"AS SO often with earthquakes, this one started almost imperceptibly. It was lunchtime, and people in Tokyo are apt to take tremors lightly. It took just a frozen heartbeat, though, for that to change. One of us was seated at a coffee shop along a huge slab of oak that sat 14. It shook so violently, people raced outside. Another of us was next to a busy kitchen; metal pots shook, then crashed off the shelves, and with the noise diners came rushing up from tables in the basement and out into the streets. Within minutes, Tokyo's narrow alleys were choked with people, some visibly shocked, most eerily quiet, listening to the clanking power lines overhead, and quite understandably bereft without mobile-phone signals. As I walked onto one of the shopping boulevards of Omote-Sando, a sea of evacuees from the buildings that run along it let out a roar of fear when a second—and then a third—aftershock hit. As cars swayed, and trees lurched overhead, you could feel the power of the beast writhing underneath Japan.
The country has long prepared for something like this—and it showed. Friends quickly offered advice. Stay in open spaces; when back at home, fill up your bath and your rice cooker, so that there is plenty of food and water in reserve. Though phone signals were mostly dead (apparently to leave bandwidth for emergency services), the internet functioned. That meant e-mail and Skype worked, and Facebook and Twitter conveyed news, tips and just the sort of offbeat information that is uplifting in the face of adversity (according to one Facebook rumour, this being Japan, airlines are generously offering cheap flights for anyone wanting to leave the country). Schoolchildren, benefitting from years of drills, looked calmer than some of their teachers."
earthquake,"MANILA, Philippines — A 7.1 magnitude quake jolted a large part of Mindanao and was felt as far as Zamboanga City at 8:23 p.m. Thursday, sending people out of houses and buildings here, most of them not wearing their face masks.
A bulletin from the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) disclosed that the epicenter of the quake was traced at 231 kilometers southeast of Jose Abad Santos town in Davao Occidental.
The quake, which was tectonic in origin and had a depth of focus of 116 kilometers, came more than a year after the series of destructive quakes that displaced thousands in Mindanao from October to December 2019.
Intensity V was recorded in General Santos City, Intensity IV in Davao City, and Intensity II in Bislig City, Surigao del Sur, it added."
drought,"The mighty Rio Grande is looking less mighty as U.S. forecasters predict spring flows will be less than half of average — or worse — and that signals potential trouble for the already stressed waterway.
One of the longest rivers in North America, the Rio Grande delivers drinking water and irrigation supplies to millions of people from southern Colorado into Texas and Mexico under a decades-old water-sharing agreement. With more dry years than wet ones over the last two decades, how much water ends up flowing downstream has been a point of contention among the states.
As New Mexico and Texas battle over their shares before the U.S. Supreme Court, forecasters with the federal government’s Natural Resources Conservation Service say river and stream flows across New Mexico have dropped noticeably following a somewhat dry March.
The models show drought is expected to keep its hold over the mountains along the New Mexico-Colorado border that feed the Rio Grande, while California, Nevada and other southwestern states aren’t likely to see a reprieve from dry conditions through June."
wildfires,"Strong winds and low humidities from Tropical Storm Lee without the benefit of any rain have created conditions ripe for wildfires in Texas. The Texas Forest Service is reporting that approximately 429 homes have been destroyed in the 38 large fires that are currently burning.
On Sunday Texas mobilized additional National Guard Blackhawk helicopters and Texas Intrastate Fire Mutual Aid System (TIFMAS) strike teams as well as a heavy airtanker from South Dakota. At this time dozens of firefighting aircraft are being used, including four heavy airtankers, 15 single-engine airtankers, 12 helicopters, and 13 aerial supervision aircraft. A Type 1 incident management team has been requested to assist with the Bastrop County Complex.
The strong winds are expected to continue over the east half or more of the state along with drier relative humidities into the 10 to 20 percent range across much of the state. High temperatures will be in the upper 70s to lower 80s over a large portion of North Texas to near 100 over Deep South Texas near the Mexico border. The stronger winds are expected to weaken over most of the state Monday night."
Typhoon,"Michele Vincent’s home was largely intact in spite of hurricanes Laura and Delta But tears streamed down her face as she looked at her church’s broken windows and shattered pews.
“It’s hard to come back and see it again and then to know there’s another (hurricane) that’s out there,” Vincent, of Cameron told The Advertiser of Lafayette. “It’s tough.”
She said people leave with every hurricane that batters Louisiana's lightly populated southwest coast.
“Yeah, our house is still there, but do you know how lonely this place is going to be?” she said.
Coastal Cameron Parish had about 9,800 residents when Hurricane Rita hit in 2005. The next census, in 2010, found about 6,800 people in the parish, Louisiana's equivalent of a county elsewhere.
“I don’t know what’ll happen now, with these two storms,” said Scott Trahan, vice president of the parish police jury.
Hurricane Laura made landfall in Cameron on Aug. 27 and Delta came in Friday near Creole, just 13 miles (21 kilometers) to the east, where Trahan lives.
“Everywhere you look it's destruction around here,” he said in a phone interview Monday with The Associated Press. “Leave Cameron Parish and go into Calcasieu it's bad there too. You can run from the water but you can't run from the winds.”
The Army Corps of Engineers said Monday that it is still installing tarps on homes damaged by Hurricane Laura, and will check on and replace if needed those already installed and then hit by Delta in Allen, Beauregard, Calcasieu, Cameron, Jefferson Davis and Vernon parishes. “ALL eligible homeowners within the six affected parishes are eligible to sign-up for a FREE temporary roof ... through Oct. 24,” a news release said.
More than 183,000 homes and businesses remained without power about noon Monday, according to the website PowerOutage.us -- down from what Gov. John Bel Edwards said was 638,000 after Delta’s landfall."
drought,"More anthills than blades of grass are visible in some of the cracked earth around Junction. The year-long drought has plagued the town — as it has the rest of the state — and for a painful, six-week stretch, Junction banned all outdoor watering.
Some 4.5 inches of rain earlier this month increased the flow of the Llano River, two forks of which meet at the town. But the water is still pretty low — and four panelists at the Texas Water Symposium last week brought some unwelcome news to the townspeople: It’s not going to get any better anytime soon.
“As the state climatologist, people ask me, ‘When’s it going to rain?’” said John Nielsen-Gammon, one of the panelists, who is a professor of meteorology at Texas A&M University and the state's climatologist.
The answer, according to Nielsen-Gammon, is “eventually,” but chances are the drought will last another year, possibly even another decade.
The weather, or lack thereof, can be attributed to La Nia, a cyclical weather pattern resulting in cooler waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Meteorologists say that although La Nia had faded by the summer, it has now returned and is strengthening.
In the past 12 months, Texas has seen 11.1 inches of rainfall on average, according to Nielsen-Gammon, and it broke a heat record for the country that was previously set during the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. Texas AgriLife Extension Service estimates the cost of the drought to be about 5.2 billion, and that estimate — already out of date because it was compiled two months ago — doesn’t include the impact to several kinds of crops and the forestry industry.
Junction, known as the land of living waters, has seen some of its streams dry up. In August, town officials say, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality told Junction to cease outdoor water use of any kind when the town of Llano downstream reported it was close to running out of water."
earthquake,"Thousands flee for safety and higher ground after island’s second quake in 24 hours
At least 37 people have been killed and hundreds injured following a strong earthquake that shook the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia early on Friday morning, prompting landslides and destroying houses.
Thousands of people fled their homes to seek safety when the 6.2-magnitude earthquake hit just after 1am local time on Friday morning. The epicentre was 6km north-east of Majene city in West Sulawesi.
Hundreds of buildings were destroyed or damaged, including a hospital, which collapsed with more than a dozen patients and staff trapped beneath it.
“The hospital is flattened,” said Arianto, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, from the rescue agency in Mamuju city, near Majene. Rescuers were also trying to reach a family of eight buried beneath the rubble of their destroyed home, he told AFP.
At least 37 people have been killed in Majene and Mamuju, and rescue workers fear the death toll will rise further. “Many of the dead are buried under rubble,” said Ali Rahman, the head of the local disaster mitigation agency in Mamuju. In Majene, 637 people were said to be injured."
Typhoon,"Storm-weary Louisiana is once again under a hurricane warning, with Zeta leaving Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula on a path that could hit New Orleans Wednesday night.
Zeta, the 27th named storm in a very busy Atlantic season, made landfall just north of the ancient Mayan city of Tulum with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph (130 kph). It weakened to a tropical storm as it crossed over land, but it was expected to regain its strength over the Gulf of Mexico.
Zeta’s top winds were 70 mph (110 kmh) early Tuesday, centered about 560 miles (905 kmh) south of the mouth of the Mississippi River. If Zeta makes landfall in Louisiana, it will be the fifth named storm to hit the state this year, joining Cristobal, Laura, Marco and Delta."
Typhoon,"Thick mud and debris coated many villages around the Philippine capital on Friday after a typhoon killed at least 42 people and caused extensive flooding that sent people fleeing to their roofs, officials said.
Troops, police, coast guard and disaster-response teams rescued tens of thousands of people, including many who flooded radio and TV networks and social media with desperate pleas for help.
Floodwaters receded and the weather cleared in many areas after Typhoon Vamco blew out into the South China Sea on Friday, but the military said it was still rescuing people trapped in some flooded communities.
Amphibious assault vehicles usually used in counter-insurgency operations were deployed for the rescue work, military chief of staff Gen. Gilbert Gapay said in a meeting with disaster-response officials.
“We’ll continue to look for the missing, help in damage assessment,” Gapay said.
The national police reported that the death toll had risen to at least 42 with 20 missing. The government’s main disaster-response agency, which waits for provincial reports and follows a laborious process of verifying casualties, reported a much lower death count, causing confusion.
Among the dead were at least 12 villagers who were dug out from mud and rockslides in the northern provinces of Cagayan and Nueva Vizcaya, police said.
After slamming into northeastern Quezon province, Vamco gained strength with sustained winds of 155 kilometers (96 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 255 kph (158 mph). It blew north of metropolitan Manila overnight Wednesday, toppling trees and power poles, swelling rivers, flooding residential communities and setting off landslides and storm surges.
In hard-hit Marikina city in the capital region and the towns of Rodriguez and Cainta in nearby Rizal province, several villages were inundated by water that reached the second and third floors of many houses, prompting hundreds of residents to flee to their roofs and call TV and radio networks or post desperate messages on social media. The panic was exacerbated by widespread power outages and loss of internet access.
Videos of Marikina showed a thick coat of muddy water covering roads and staining houses and cars. Residents carried appliances and furniture from their homes and used pails and shovels to remove the mud after the water receded.
In a televised meeting of Cabinet and disaster-response officials Friday, a reporter asked where President Rodrigo Duterte was, prompting an annoyed response from his spokesman."
Typhoon,"The turbulent Atlantic hurricane season passed a grim new milestone as Subtropical Storm Theta formed on Monday night.
The arrival of Theta means that 2020 has now broken the record for the number of storms strong enough to be given names in a single season.
Theta is the 29th named storm of the hurricane season, and meteorologists say another could strike the Caribbean in the coming days.
So far, a dozen storms have made landfall in the US this year. Storms have also caused severe damage across Central American and Caribbean countries including Belize, Bermuda, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua and Panama."
earthquake,"A rare earthquake centered in Virginia rattled parts of New Jersey and New York shortly before 2 p.m. today, causing buildings to sway in cities and towns across the region.
There were no immediate reports of any injuries or structural damage, but the quake rattled nerves.
The U.S. Geological Survey reported that a magnitude 5.9 earthquake hit at 1:51 p.m. and the epicenter was northwest of Richmond, Va., about halfway to Charlottesville. The Associated Press is reporting the quake was felt in Washington, D.C., New York City and North Carolina.
The quake was later downgraded to a magnitude 5.8.
U.S.G.S. Geophysicist Julie Dutton said an earthquake of this magnitude is rare for the East Coast but that the effects are felt widely in our region because quakes move more easily through the bedrock."
earthquake,"An earthquake of 5.4 magnitude hit Sikkim on Monday night, the National Centre for Seismology said, with tremors being also felt in the eastern states of Assam, West Bengal and Bihar.
The quake occurred at 8.49 PM at a depth of 10 kilometres near the India-Bhutan border, the NCS said.
In Sikkim, panic-stricken people rushed out of their houses. There was no immediate report of any major damage.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to the chief ministers of Sikkiam, Bihar and Assam and took stock of the situation in eastern India following the quake, government sources said.
""PM Narendra Modi is taking stock of the damage due to the earthquake. He is speaking to chief ministers of all 4 affected states and has already spoken to the CMs of Bihar, Assam and Sikkim,"" the sources said.
West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar said that he called up Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and enquired about her well-being as she is in Siliguri, where the tremors were felt.
""Had telephone conversation @MamataOfficial to enquire her well-being as Earthquake Tremors Felt In North Bengal. Hon'ble CM is at Siliguri presently. Relieved to learn all well at her end,"" he tweeted.
The Himalayas are prone to earthquakes and are known for high-seismic activity."
Typhoon,"Hurricane Eta erupted quickly into a potentially catastrophic major hurricane Monday as it headed for Central America, where forecasters warned of massive flooding and landslides across a vulnerable region.
Eta was a Category 4 storm with maximum sustained winds of 240 kph late Monday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. It was centred about 45 miles (75 kilometres) east of Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua, and moving west-southwest at 7 mph (11 kph).
The centre said Eta was likely to strengthen further and could reach Category 5 before running ashore by early Tuesday in Nicaragua, where it could bring rains measured in feet rather than inches."
drought,"A potent combination of record-breaking heat and a lack of rain has led to the rapid development of drought across the southeastern United States and Tennessee and Ohio Valleys during September 2019. Coming off an extremely wet 2018 east of the Rockies, the fast onset of widespread extensive drought has been quite the climate whiplash for millions across the Southeast.  With warmer than average temperatures expected to continue and October being a generally dry month based on climatology, drought conditions are likely to continue and possibly expand and intensify over the next week.
The extent to which drought has overtaken the southeastern United States by the end of September would have been hard to explain to residents of the region just a month prior.  While a few localized areas in Georgia/Alabama were already mired in drought, the broader region extending into the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys was drought free. In fact, the twelve-month period (September 2018-August 2019) coming to an end was record wet. But then, while it continued to be hot, things turned incredibly dry.
The rapid onset and severity of the event qualified it as a “Flash drought.” Generally, droughts are caused by a lack of precipitation over an extended period of time. In contrast, a flash drought is preceded not just by a lack of rain, but also very high temperatures and/or lots of sunny days. Even if the dry period is not especially severe, the latter two can suck moisture from the ground quickly.
For operational purposes, NOAA National Weather Service’s Climate Prediction Center defines a flash drought as an event during which an area experiences degradation by two or more drought categories in a four week period, based on the U.S. Drought Monitor."
earthquake,"NEW DELHI: A high intensity earthquake of magnitude 6.3 struck Tajikistan at 10:31pm, sending tremors in Delhi-NCR and several other parts of north India on Friday night.
Tremors were also felt across Pakistan including the capital, Islamabad, and northwestern Peshawar, and even as far as the eastern city of Lahore, which borders India.
The quake struck at the depth of 91.6 km and its epicentre was located 35 km west of Murghab town in Tajikistan.
The area of the epicentre is largely unpopulated mountain terrain.
There were no immediate reports of any loss of life or damage to property."
Typhoon,"Former Hurricane Oscar, which peaked with winds over 100mph when it whipped through the Caribbean earlier this week, will pass near the British Isles on Saturday.
Although the weather system has now been downgraded, the Met Office has still issued a yellow warning for rain across western Scotland.
""Heavy and persistent rain” is expected across Scotland for much of the day, according to the Met Office.
Spray and flooding is expected to make driving much harder and journey times longer, and bus and train services will also be affected.
The first rains brought by the remnants of Hurricane Oscar will hit Northern Ireland on Friday afternoon, before the downpours and winds pick up early on Saturday morning for most of western Scotland and parts of north-western England.
By the end of Saturday the bad weather will have reached Wales and parts of eastern England as well, and BBC weather forecaster Nick Miller has warned that the winds could reach speeds of 60mph.
“Wherever you are, the breeze is picking up, particularly in the west. But it’s nowhere near as cold, but you may still see a touch of frost in eastern England,"" he said.
“The next system is a deep area of low pressure – ex-Hurricane Oscar. It passes us to the northwest but we are close enough to get a windier day across the UK on Saturday and a very wet day in western Scotland.”
The mercury plummeted overnight, with the coldest spots seeing temperatures of -2C early on Friday morning. But the coming storms will see more mild temperatures, Mr Miller said, with temperatures of 8 or 9C on Saturday morning."
earthquake,"An earthquake measuring a preliminary magnitude of 6.0 struck Thursday in waters off the south coast of Panama, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
The quake was recorded around 9:42 GMT Thursday at a depth of 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) under the northern Pacific Ocean, some 150 kilometers (93 miles) southeast of Punta de Burica, Panama.
The USGS said little or no population was exposed to the quake. No tsunami warning has been issued.
No other details were immediately available."
earthquake,"One of the strongest earthquakes to hit the South Pacific in modern history triggered tsunami warnings across the ocean and forced thousands of people in New Zealand to evacuate coastal areas Friday. Small tsunami waves were seen, but little damage was apparent hours later.
The magnitude 8.1 quake in the Kermadec Islands region about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) from New Zealand was the largest in a series of tremors over several hours, including two earlier quakes that registered magnitude 7.4 and magnitude 7.3.
The tsunami threat caused traffic jams and some chaos in New Zealand as people scrambled to get to higher ground.
Residents recorded videos of small wave surges in some places, including at Tokomaru Bay near Gisborne. In the afternoon, the National Emergency Management Agency said the threat had passed and people could return to their homes, although they should continue avoiding beaches.
One of the earlier quakes hit much closer to New Zealand and awoke many people as they felt a long, rumbling shaking. “Hope everyone is ok out there,” New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern wrote on Facebook during the night."
earthquake," A 4.7-magnitude earthquake felt throughout the state and beyond late Sunday night appears to be the biggest temblor in Arkansas in more than three decades.
Scott Ausbrooks, the geohazards supervisor for the Arkansas Geological Survey, said the shaking was the most intense of nearly 800 small earthquakes rumbling out of Faulkner County since September and ties a 4.7 quake recorded in 1976. The 4.7-magnitude is still preliminary, but Ausbrooks said Monday it was a ""low-end"" estimate and it is not expected to be downgraded.
The quake was centered near Greenbrier, where much of the seismic activity has occurred in the past six months. The shaking was felt far and wide this time, with thousands of people from Arkansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Mississippi reporting feeling it."
drought,"In some areas of Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia and Uganda, drought conditions are the worst in 60 years, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in an update.
Almost half the of children arriving in refugees camps in Ethiopia from southern Somalia are malnourished, while 11 districts in Kenya have reported malnutrition rates above the 15 per cent emergency threshold. Supplementary and therapeutic feeding programmes are struggling to keep pace with the rising needs, according to OCHA.
Drought-related displacement and refugee flows are on the rise, with an average of 15,000 Somalis arriving in Kenya and Ethiopia every month this year seeking assistance.
“While conflict has been a fact of life for them for years, it is the drought that has taken them to breaking point. Many have walked for days, are exhausted, in poor health, desperate for food and water, and arriving in a worse condition than usual,” according to the OCHA update on the drought situation in the region.
The influx of Somalis into refugee camps in the Dadaab area of Kenya’s North-Eastern province – the largest refugee settlement in the world – has led to worsening overcrowding amid limited resources.
The drought has forced children out of school as both human and livestock diseases spread. Competition for the meagre resources is causing tensions among communities.
The price of grain in drought-affected areas of Kenya is 30 to 80 per cent more than the five-year average, according to OCHA, while in Ethiopia, the consumer price index for food increased by almost 41 per cent last month. Further food price hikes area expected in Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda and Somalia, but could ease after the next harvests expected later this year.
OCHA called for the scaling up of the emergency response in all affected areas, urging governments, donors and relief agencies step up efforts to prevent further deterioration.
Further funding is also required to enable humanitarian agencies to provide the necessary assistance. UN agencies and the partners this year requested 529 million for Somalia, but only 50 per cent of that amount has been received.
In Kenya, where 525 million is required, about 54 per cent of that money has been obtained so far. The appeal for Djibouti is for 39 million, but only 30 per cent has been received."
drought,"The spectre of drought looms over the country almost as a certainty like the annual floods. This year large swathes of almost all central Indian states are reeling under severe water scarcity. Much beyond the news reports, statistics and the weather graphs, the drought is a calamity that unfolds in the anguish of people struggling for water. India Today sent its team of photographers deep into the drought-affected districts of the country to capture the widespread severity of the situation - what they have photographed goes beyond the routine imagery of cracked earth and dried river beds - these are images that show how the drought is lived through.

drought,"A megadrought worse than any in “known prehistory” may already be underway in the western United States and northern Mexico, researchers have suggested.
After experiencing a wetter-than-average 20th century, the region has been suffering an ever-lengthening string of dry years starting in 2000, and scientists have now warned the worsening climate crisis is partly responsible for pushing the region towards extreme long-term drought.
The study is based on modern weather observations, along with 1,200 years of tree-ring data and dozens of climate models.
“Earlier studies were largely model projections of the future,” said lead author Park Williams, a bioclimatologist at Columbia University‘s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.
“We’re no longer looking at projections, but at where we are now. We now have enough observations of current drought and tree-ring records of past drought to say that we’re on the same trajectory as the worst prehistoric droughts.”
Reliable modern observations date only to about 1900, but tree rings have allowed scientists to infer yearly soil moisture for centuries before humans began influencing the climate.
The study has rung alarm bells, as previous research has linked the catastrophic ancient droughts recorded in tree rings to concurrent upheavals among indigenous medieval-era civilisations in the southwest US.
The new study is the most up-to-date and comprehensive long-term analysis, the researchers have said. It covers an area stretching across nine US states from Oregon and Montana down through California and New Mexico, and part of northern Mexico.
Using rings from thousands of trees, the researchers charted dozens of droughts across the region, starting in 800 AD.
Four stand out as so-called megadroughts, with extreme aridity lasting decades: the late 800s, mid-1100s, the 1200s, and the late 1500s. After 1600, there were other droughts, but none on such a large scale.
The team then compared the ancient megadroughts to soil moisture records calculated from observed weather in the years from 2000 to 2018.
They found the current drought is already outdoing the three earliest ones. The fourth, which spanned 1575 to 1603, may have been the worst of all — but the difference is slight enough to be within the range of uncertainty.
Furthermore, the current drought is affecting wider areas more consistently than any of the earlier ones — this is the “fingerprint” of climate change and associated temperatures, the researchers said.
All of the ancient droughts lasted longer than 19 years — the one that started in the 1200s ran for nearly a century — but all began by following a similar path to what is happening now, they said.
The ancient droughts weren’t driven by manmade climate change, and nature is still playing a strong role today.
A study last year led by Nathan Steiger at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University showed among other things, that unusually cool periodic conditions over the tropical Pacific Ocean (commonly called La Ni?a) during the previous megadroughts pushed storm tracks further north, and starved the region of precipitation."
drought,"It's one of the most overlooked disasters in the world. In Madagascar, 1.5 million people are suffering from a serious food crisis and need emergency assistance. Several dozen people have already died of hunger. An unprecedented drought, which hit the south of the island in recent years and destroyed almost all of the crops, is mostly to blame. As the UN World Food Programme asks for emergency aid of €62.45 million, our correspondent Ga?lle Borgia travelled to Anosy, the region hardest hit by the crisis.
For the past six months in Madagascar, men, women, the elderly and children have been dying of hunger. However, although the World Food Programme (WFP) has requested €62.45 million from donor countries, the Malagasy government remains largely indifferent to the crisis and has refused to declare a state of emergency.
The region of Anosy, in the far south of Madagascar, has been particularly hard hit by the unprecedented drought. It is also one of the most remote and dangerous areas of the island.
The district of Amboasary Atsimo, from where we reported, is often the scene of attacks from ""dahalo"" – rural bandits who carry out raids in villages and kill."
Typhoon,"Typhoon Molave slammed into Vietnam with destructive force Wednesday, killing at least two people and sinking two fishing boats with 26 crew members in what was feared to be the most powerful storm to hit the country in 20 years.
Winds of up to 150 kilometers (93 miles) per hour killed a man by knocking him off his roof as he was trying to reinforce it in south-central Quang Ngai province. Another man was pinned to death by a fallen tree in the coastal province, the official Vietnam News Agency reported.
The navy deployed two rescue boats to search for the 26 fishermen off Binh Dinh province, according to state-run VTV network. It was not immediately clear if anyone was saved in the storm-tossed waters."
drought,"Almost half of India – an area home to more than 500 million people – is facing drought-like conditions while a blistering heatwave has killed dozens of people in the impoverished eastern state of Bihar.
As the country suffers its lowest rainfall ahead of a monsoon season in more than six decades, the western state of Maharashtra witnesses its worst drought in 47 years, forcing many to leave their lands and take shelter in relief camps, as they wait for monsoon rains.
Reporting from Beed in Maharashtra, Al Jazeera’s Elizabeth Puranam said people walk in intense heat, sometimes for kilometres, only to find a small amount of muddy water at the bottom of a well.
Asha Pawar said she collects about five pots – or 100 litres – of water a day for herself and her four children. The state government provides water tankers, but Pawar said they only come every four or five days.
“We have no arrangements for water. We keep getting it from whatever source is available. If nothing is available, we climb down the well for drinking water,” Pawar told Al Jazeera.
“My daughter fell in the well when she went to fetch water. A passer-by rescued her when he heard her scream.”
Elsewhere in Beed, farmers have left their land and moved to nearby relief camps, where the government provides fodder and water to keep their cattle alive.
“There is no water left in the Beed area. It used to rain by June 7, but there are still no signs of rains. Last year, we had a drought situation. This year is worse. If it doesn’t rain again this year, we have to leave our village,” said farmer Navnath Kadam, who has already spent four months at a relief camp."
drought,"More than 44 per cent of India's areas were under various degrees of drought conditions (abnormally dry to exceptionally dry) as of June 10, 2019 — that is nearly 11 percentage point over a year ago, according to the Drought Early Warning System (DEWS).
Within this, ‘severe to exceptionally dry conditions’ prevailed in 17.33 per cent area, according to the real-time drought monitoring platform.
While just 0.65 per cent of area had ‘exceptionally dry’ conditions in June 2018, it has now jumped to 5.87 per cent, stated the latest data.
Further, the delay in southwest monsoons has worsened the drought index, the DEWS reported.
In the June 6 update, real-time platform recorded 43.02 per cent area under ‘abnormally to exceptionally dry’ conditions. However, the latest data showed an increase (44.17 per cent). 
Similarly, percentage of area under ‘extremely dry to exceptional dry’ increased from 10.83 to 11.22 per cent during the same period.
India has witnessed the second-driest pre-monsoon season in the last 65 years. The country received 99 millimeters (mm) rainfall between March and May — with 23 per cent below the normal rainfall during this time of the year —, showed the latest data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD).
The deficit is prevalent across the country with south India having a deficit of 47 per cent, followed by northwest India (30 per cent), central India (18 per cent), and east and northeast (14 per cent).
The month of June, which accounts for 18 per cent of rain, may end up with a deficit of 40 per cent in at least 66 districts across the country, warned Skymet Weather, a private weather forecasting agency.
The low rainfall would be difficult to make up for the deficit in coming months, it noted.
According to the IMD, there is also a possibility of weaker monsoon in July. It could be a great cause of worry, as the month is crucial and receives one third of the total monsoon rains in the country. 
The sluggish pace of the south west monsoon has compounded the severe dry spell. As a result, at least 30 sub-divisions are likely to experience ‘deficient’ and ‘largely deficient’ monsoon season, the IMD said.
Most of these are in Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, and the north eastern states. Only four sub-divisions in Karnataka, Gujarat, and Lakshadweep have witnessed ‘normal’ rainfall.
Low rainfall has also contributed to a downward trend in water levels in at least 71 of 91 reservoirs across India, a recent bulletin by the Central Water Commission (CWC), has showed.
The situation is particularly grim in the north-western region — in Gujarat and Maharashtra — and in the southern states of Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu, it said."
earthquake,"The most surprising thing about the magnitude-8.9 earthquake that hit Japan today is that it was a surprise. Despite what may be the world's most intensive effort to map faults and assess risks by a notoriously earthquake-prone and earthquake-conscious nation, such a strong quake was not anticipated for the region, says University of Tokyo geophysicist Robert Geller.
The earthquake occurred 130 kilometers east of Sendai and 373 kilometers northeast of Tokyo, along or very near the boundary between two tectonic plates, where the Pacific plate is being drawn under the Japanese islands. Movement along plate boundaries is known to be capable of producing major earthquakes. And Japan's latest national seismic risk map gave a 99% chance of a magnitude-7.5 or greater quake occurring in that area in the next 30 years, Geller says.
Although today's quake technically satisfies that prediction, the logarithmic scale used for measuring the power of earthquakes means that a magnitude-8.9 earthquake releases well over 100 times more energy than does a magnitude-7.5 quake. ""I don't think those hazard assessments are meaningful,"" Geller says."
drought,"The U.S. Drought Monitor recently reported that, for the first time in its nearly 20-year history, none of the contiguous states was showing symptoms of severe or exceptional drought. That report includes Arizona, as this year’s abnormally wet May helped push the state out of a 10-year drought period.
According to the monitor’s weekly report for late last week, only 20.5% of Arizona was showing moderate drought or “abnormally dry” symptoms. Data for the same week in 2018 found 100% of the state in moderate drought or abnormally dry, with a majority of the state experiencing severe (97%) or extreme drought (73.2%).
Richard Heim, a meteorologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Centers for Environmental Information, said the change was tied to this year’s wet spring.
“Rain and snow have been falling in the areas that needed it, so the drought’s contracted a lot,” he said.
Arizona is no stranger to downpours in the monsoon season, which runs June 15 to Sept. 30, according the National Weather Service, but heavy rain and snowfall in spring isn’t typical for the Southwest.
State climatologist Nancy Selover said the increased rain and snow came from winter storms over the Southwest that lingered longer and provided more moisture than in the past."
earthquake,"Champhai (Mizoram): An earthquake of a magnitude 3.1 on the Richter scale hit the Champhai of Arunachal Pradesh on Thursday night, said the National Centre for Seismology (NCS).
According to the NCS, the quake took place at 12.45 am.
""Earthquake of Magnitude:3.1, Occurred on 11-02-2021, 00:45:51 IST, Lat: 23.70 and Long: 93.10, Depth: 30 Km, Location: Champhai Mizoram, India,"" the NCS said.
Earlier on Tuesday, an earthquake of a magnitude 2.3 on the Richter scale had hit the West Kameng district of the state.

wildfires,"Nearly 3 billion animals were affected by Australia's worst wildfire season that burned from last July through March, scientists announced Tuesday — a figure almost three times higher than original estimates.
The report released Tuesday and commissioned by the World Wide Fund for Nature Australia said more than 46 million acres were scorched. An estimate in January said 1.25 billion animals were affected.
""This ranks as one of the worst wildlife disasters in modern history,” Dermot O’Gorman, the organization's chief executive officer, said in a statement. ""It’s hard to think of another event anywhere in the world in living memory that has killed or displaced that many animals.""
Ten researchers from Australian universities and wildlife groups involved in the report have been looking at both the impact of the fires and the possible ways to protect ecosystems in the future.
The affected wildlife includes 143 million mammals, 2.46 billion reptiles, 180 million birds and 51 million frogs.
""It's almost impossible to comprehend how many individuals that actually means,"" Lily van Eeden, a researcher at the University of Sydney and a co-author of the report, told NBC News.
The jump in the estimated animals affected compared to the January report is due to a wider geographic area being studied and new data on wildlife, she said.
Despite the increased scope of the research, Van Eeden cautioned, the estimate is still ""quite conservative.""
Invertebrate species — such as spiders and butterflies — were not included and neither was a range of wildlife that lives in waterways like turtles."
drought,"The United Nations’ food agency issued an alert on Tuesday warning that a severe drought was threatening the wheat crop in China, the world’s largest wheat producer, and resulting in shortages of drinking water for people and livestock.
China has been essentially self-sufficient in grain for decades, for national security reasons. Any move by China to import large quantities of food in response to the drought could drive international prices even higher than the record levels recently reached.
“China’s grain situation is critical to the rest of the world ? if they are forced to go out on the market to procure adequate supplies for their population, it could send huge shock waves through the world’s grain markets,” said Robert S. Zeigler, the director general of the International Rice Research Institute in Los Ba?os, in the Philippines.
The state-run news media in China warned Monday that the country’s major agricultural regions were facing their worst drought in 60 years. On Tuesday the state news agency Xinhua said that Shandong Province, a cornerstone of Chinese grain production, was bracing for its worst drought in 200 years unless substantial precipitation came by the end of this month.
World wheat prices are already surging, and they have been widely cited as one reason for protests in Egypt and elsewhere in the Arab world. A separate United Nations report last week said global food export prices had reached record levels in January. The impact of China’s drought on global food prices and supplies could create serious problems for less affluent countries that rely on imported food.
With 2.85 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, nearly three times that of Japan, the country with the second-largest reserves, China has ample buying power to prevent any serious food shortages."
earthquake,"A magnitude-5.0 offshore earthquake occurred in the Caribbean Sea off central Panama at around 01:13 May 1. The epicenter was about 18 km (11 miles) north of Santa Isabel in Colon Province. The tremor occurred at a depth of about 27 km (17 miles), and weak-to-light shaking was probably felt throughout central and eastern regions, including eastern Cocle, Colon, northern Darien, Guna Yala, Panama, and Panama Oeste provinces. There have been no initial reports of damage or casualties as a result of the earthquake. It could take several hours until authorities can conduct comprehensive damage assessments, especially in remote areas. Aftershocks are possible over the coming days.
Officials may temporarily shut down transportation infrastructure in the tremor zone to check for damage. Minor disruptions could occur during shutdowns, but service will likely resume quickly if no damage is found. Utility outages are possible, particularly near the earthquake's epicenter. The event has not prompted any tsunami advisories."
earthquake,"Japan's most powerful earthquake since records began has struck the north-east coast, triggering a massive tsunami.
Cars, ships and buildings were swept away by a wall of water after the 8.9-magnitude tremor, which struck about 400km (250 miles) north-east of Tokyo.
A state of emergency has been declared at a nuclear power plant, where pressure has exceeded normal levels.
Officials say 350 people are dead and about 500 missing, but it is feared the final death toll will be much higher.
In one ward alone in Sendai, a port city in Miyagi prefecture, 200 to 300 bodies were found.
The quake was the fifth-largest in the world since 1900 and nearly 8,000 times stronger than the one which devastated Christchurch, New Zealand, last month, said scientists.
Thousands of people living near the Fukushima nuclear power plant have been ordered to evacuate.
Japanese nuclear officials said pressure inside a boiling water reactor at the plant was running much higher than normal after the cooling system failed.
Officials said they might need to deliberately release some radioactive steam to relieve pressure, but that there would be no health risk.
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had earlier said the US Air Force had flown emergency coolant to the site."
Typhoon,"Cyclonic storm Tauktae intensified overnight into a ""very severe cyclonic storm"", the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) said. 100 rescue teams have been deployed in Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Goa.
Cyclone Tauktae is ""very likely to intensify further"" during the next 12 hours, the weather office said, adding it may cross Gujarat coast between Porbandar and Mahuva in Bhavnagar district on Tuesday morning.
""Ignore rumours, stay calm and don't panic,"" the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said as it advised people to follow weather updates on radio, TV and newspaper.
Fishermen have been asked not to venture out in the sea."
drought,"A severe drought has left about 793,333 hectares of crops affected in northern China's Hebei Province, the provincial department of water resources said Friday.
According to the department, 15,700 people have difficulties accessing drinking water, while 3,000 domestic animals are also facing a water shortage.
The province has seen less rainfall since June, with average precipitation standing at 37 mm, about 55 percent lower than the same period in previous years.
To fight the drought, Hebei will carry out drought-resistant projects such as building pools, water cellars and pumping wells. It will also mobilize the public to transport water to guarantee basic living needs of the affected people and livestock and ensure water supply for the industrial and agricultural use in the province."
drought,"More people have been displaced by drought in western Afghanistan than those uprooted by conflict, the United Nations has said.
A total of 275,000 people were displaced by drought this year, 52,000 more than the number who fled conflict, with more than two million threatened by the effects of water shortages.
Reports from the UN and aid charities described farmers lacking seeds to sow, following crop failures in some areas, and livestock dying from the lack of anything to eat。
Afghanistan, where nearly 20 million people rely on farming, has suffered a 45 per cent drop in agricultural output this year as drought hit the country, officials at the ministry of agriculture have said.
At least 120,000 people fleeing the drought arrived in the town of Qala-e-Naw, in Badghis province, in the week leading up to 9 September, the UN humanitarian office reported.
A second UN report, which contained data covering August, said more than 100,000 people may have moved to Herat city for the same reason by the end of last month.
The report estimated 2.2 million Afghans would be affected by the drought this year.
In Qala-e-Naw, where there are an estimated 66,500 drought-displaced people, supplies and humanitarian aid are already insufficient to meet the needs of newly arrived families.
The UN cited an assessment by aid charity World Vision International, which said 99 per cent of people in Badghis thought their food situation was worse or a lot worse than a year ago.
Most farmers lost last season’s harvest and nearly all of them lacked seeds for the new planting season, the UN study said, noting reports saying around 40 percent of livestock have been lost in Badghis due to a lack of pasture and fodder."
earthquake,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- One of the biggest earthquakes to hit the South Pacific in modern history forced thousands of people in New Zealand to evacuate and triggered tsunami warnings across the world Friday, but it did not appear to cause injuries or major damage because it struck in remote ocean.
The magnitude 8.1 quake was the largest in a series of tremors that hit the region over several hours, including two earlier quakes that registered magnitude 7.4 and magnitude 7.3.
The earthquakes triggered warning systems and caused traffic jams and some chaos in New Zealand as people scrambled to get to higher ground, but their remoteness meant they did not appear to pose a widespread threat to lives or infrastructure.
The largest quake struck about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) off the coast of New Zealand. One of the earlier quakes hit much closer to New Zealand and awoke many people as they felt a long, rumbling shaking.
“Hope everyone is ok out there,” New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern wrote on Facebook during the night.
After the largest quake, civil defense authorities in New Zealand told people in some coastal areas to immediately get to higher ground. They said a damaging tsunami was possible, and waves could reach up to 3 meters (10 feet).
Emergency Management Minister Kiri Allan told reporters that people had followed the advisory.
“They felt the long or strong earthquakes and they knew to grab their bag and head into the highlands,” she said. “I can only thank and acknowledge the tireless efforts of the men and women from up and down the coast who knew how to act, when to act, and what to do.”
She warned that the threat could remain throughout much of the afternoon and people should not return home until authorities gave the all-clear. Allan said evacuations took precedence over coronavirus distancing measures.
The U.S. Tsunami Warning System also cautioned the quake could cause tsunami waves of up to 3 meters (10 feet) in Vanuatu and up to 1 meter (3 feet) in Australia, Fiji, French Polynesia and as far away as Mexico and Peru.
The U.S. Geological Survey said it was centered near the remote Kermadec Islands at a depth of 19 kilometers (12 miles).
The agency said in a report that the quake occurred at the intersection of the Pacific and Australia tectonic plates and eclipsed the largest quake previously recorded in the region, a magnitude 8.0 in 1976.
It said the interaction between the plates creates one of the most seismically active regions in the world, and it has recorded 215 quakes there above magnitude 6.0 over the past century.
Jennifer Eccles, an earthquake expert at the University of Auckland, said the quake was at the top end of the scale for those involving only the Earth's ocean crust.
“This is about as big as it gets,” she said.
She said most quakes larger than magnitude 8.0 tend to occur when a section of more robust continental crust is involved.
The U.S. Geological Survey said the magnitude 7.4 quake was likely a “foreshock” that contributed to the larger quake but that the first quake that hit closer to New Zealand was too far away in time and distance to have directly contributed.
Officials in New Zealand had hours earlier issued a tsunami warning for coastal areas after the first quake struck off its northeastern coast at about 2:30 a.m. Friday. There were no immediate reports of serious damage or casualties, and the warning was lifted just before the largest quake hit.
The U.S. Geological Survey said the first quake was centered at a depth of 21 kilometers (13 miles) under the ocean about 174 kilometers (108 miles) northeast of the city of Gisborne.
It was widely felt in New Zealand, and residents in the major cities of Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch reported being shaken awake.
In 2011, a magnitude 6.3 quake hit the city of Christchurch, killing 185 people and destroying much of its downtown."
Typhoon,"The National Weather Service has issued hurricane watches for Hawaii and Maui counties with Hurricane Lane barreling towards the islands having been upgraded to a Category 4 storm.
Lane has sustained winds of 150 miles per hour as of Tuesday morning local time, the National Weather Service of Honolulu said
“Major Hurricane Lane could bring significant impacts to the Hawaiian Islands late week and into the weekend,” officials said. “All residents in [Hawaii] are urged to stay abreast of the situation.”
Officials said it was too early to report which of the main Hawaiian islands would be directly impacted – though they noted if the hurricane’s centre remained offshore its impacts could still extend well away from the centre. Intense showers and thunderstorms surrounding the hurricane are expected to reach the Big Island late on Tuesday night or Wednesday morning.
Senior Honolulu forecaster Tom Birchard said it’s possible island Oahu and Kaui could be included in a watch.
Officials have also issued tropical storm watches and flash flood watches for islands Kahoolawe, Kauai, Lanai, Maui, Molokai, Niihau, Oahu and the Big Island.
“As Hurricane Lane approaches the islands from the south, deep tropical moisture associated with Lane will spread across the island chain from the east, with increased potential for heavy rainfall,” officials said."
earthquake,"An earthquake of magnitude 4.0 was reported near Uttarakhand’s Pithoragarh on Friday, as per the National Center for Seismology.
The quake struck around 4:38 pm with its epicenter thought to be 33 km north-northeast of Pithoragarh, the agency added. There are no reports of any damage to life or property so far.
Uttarakhand is still reeling under the recent glacier disaster in the Chamoli district that triggered flash floods, causing over 60 deaths and massive damage to property.
More details are awaited"
drought,"Drought is a pretty complicated climate extreme to define. Most commonly, it is defined as a precipitation deficit - much less precipitation falls than what is typically expected for a given time period.
But drought can be observed in lots of ways: lack of snowpack, low flows in rivers and streams, dry soils, higher evaporative losses, low lake/reservoir levels, etc. Because the climate varies all the time, it’s a safe assumption to say that all areas experience drought similarly because all areas will see times when precipitation is (or the other water variables) less than average.
But drought is not equally distributed across the U.S. Just as there are climatologically wetter areas and drier areas across the country, the same could be said about the occurrence, frequency, and severity of drought.
So, some might be asking, ""where are the most 'drought-prone' areas?
Drought-Prone States
First, let's look at the states that experience drought most often, according to data from the U.S. Drought Monitor.
The Drought Monitor has been tracking drought conditions across the country since 2000.
Each week, the map is updated with the latest conditions ranging from none, to D0 (which is an “abnormally dry” category), to D1-D4 (which represents increasing severities of drought categories).
How the map is made is a big process that includes analysis of data that encompasses local/regional variability in all the water variables and adds a human component, like impacts."
earthquake,"South-east Victoria has been rocked by more than 40 aftershocks after a magnitude-5.4 earthquake hit near Moe in Gippsland on Tuesday night.
The tremor struck 16 kilometres west of Moe, but was felt in the centre of Melbourne and in suburbs across the city's west and south-east.
Initially measured at magnitude-5.3, it was also felt as far north as Shepparton and even Albury on the border with New South Wales.
The SES said it received dozens of calls for help for cracked walls and ceilings and a collapsed garage and chimney.
Residents and business owners are being urged to check their properties for damage before returning inside.
But the SES says there have been no reports of major damage.
Residents reported hearing a roaring noise as the quake hit just before 9:00pm at a depth of about 10km.
An SES spokesman told ABC News Breakfast there were 850 calls to emergency services in the first hour after the quake.
""The damage we've seen has largely been minor cracks in walls and a garage that has had some damage. We've also seen some shops that have had some stock come off the shelves,"" he said.
He said some homes did lose power after the quake but there have been no significant reports of gas leaks."
drought,"As parts of Western Turkey battle against recent heavy rain and flooding, the country is facing its most severe drought in a decade.
Istanbul has been warned it has less than 45 days of water left due to poor rainfall in the second half of last year.
""Last year the level of water in dams in Istanbul was twice what it is now, so it wasn't that bad. Now we are in the second year and experiencing rougher droughts,"" Dr Akgün ?lhan, a water management expert, told Euronews.
Ankara's mayor said earlier this month that the capital only had another 110 days’ worth of water left in dams and reservoirs.
Other cities across the country are also struggling with dams and reservoirs below 40 per cent full. Elsewhere farmers in wheat-producing areas fear their crop will fail.
""Since the late 1980s Turkey has faced drought periods,"" says Dr. ?lhan. ""It's every 4-7 years, which is the result of global climate change.""
""However,"" she says, ""what we face now is to a large extent a lack of adaptation or even maladaptation to climate change.""
Whilst it's true that the country receives less precipitation, it also ""makes inefficient use of the water falling on our cities."""
earthquake," No tsunami was generated from a small earthquake off the southern coast of Hawaii Island Wednesday evening.
Officials said the quake happened at 6:45 p.m. at the Loihi Seamount, which is in the waters south of the island.
It registered as a 4.0 magnitude earthquake, which is too small to generate a tsunami threat.
The quake was also too far offshore to cause any damage to buildings on land.
Scientists have been monitoring increased seismic activity around Hawaii Island, but say there is no threat of an immediate volcanic eruption. However, that isn’t stopping them from urging everyone to be prepared in the event of an emergency in the distant future."
wildfires,"In the last 48 hours, 852 homes have been consumed in the flames of Texas wildfires as dozens of blazes continue to sear the drought-plagued state, according to the Texas Forest Service.
Officials say more than 1,000 homes have been destroyed and over 115,000 acres have burned in the past seven days.
The largest wildfire is raging just east of Austin and has burned at least 600 homes and blackened 30,000 acres.
Texas Gov. Rick Perry set aside his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination to focus attention on the emergency at home. He cut short a campaign stop in South Carolina and returned to Texas on Monday. He says his participation in Wednesday's debate in California is a ""fluid situation.""
""I'll be real honest with you, I'm not paying any attention to politics right now,"" Perry said. ""There's plenty of time to take care of that. People's lives and their possessions are in danger. That's substantially more important.""
""I have seen a number of big fires in my life ... this one is as mean looking as I've ever seen,"" he added.
The wall of smoke and flames, 16 miles long and 4 miles wide, has resulted in the evacuation of more than 5,000 people. Five shelters have been set up across the affected area.
The massive wildfire began Sunday afternoon in Bastrop County and is zero percent contained. Texas Forest Service spokeswoman Victoria Koenig said that they expect the wind that has been fueling the flames to die down today, but that it is still a ""tough, tough fire.""
The emergency is not limited to the one fire about 30 miles east of Austin. Roughly 35 other fires are actively burning across this drought-stricken state.
Many Texans prayed Tropical Lee would bring rain, but instead only gusty winds made Texas' most active fire season ever that much worse. The state is experiencing its worst drought since the 1950s.
In the past nine months, Texas has experienced six of the ten largest wildfires in its history and since November 3,523 homes and structures have been lost to the flames, according to the Texas Forest Service."
wildfires,"A fast-moving wildfire burning Monday along the Royal Gorge and U.S. 50 west of Ca?on City forced the evacuation of homes, businesses, campgrounds and parks, including Royal Gorge and Buckskin Joe, and destroyed several structures.
“Anybody, whether they’re businesses, whether they’re residences, camping or anything else, everybody has been evacuated from the area,” said Bureau of Land Management spokeswoman Cass Cairns.
By Monday evening, winds with gusts of 20 mph to 30 mph had pushed the fire northeast from the intersection of U.S. 50 and Colorado 9 over 700 acres. Smoke and poor visibility closed U.S. 50 6 miles west of Ca?on City.
The Fremont County Sheriff’s Office called 177 businesses and residents asking them to evacuate. Cairns said it was unclear how many structures had burned or whether any were homes.
Smoke from the fire burning in an area known as Parkdale could be seen and smelled in Colorado Springs on Monday night.
The National Weather Service issued a red flag warning for the region, advising that strong winds and relatively low humidity might cause the fire to spread.
About 50 firefighters were battling the fire on the ground, supported by a fleet of aircraft dropping flame retardant, Cairns said. These included one large air tanker, a single-engine plane, a large helicopter and a smaller helicopter.
Mike Bandera, general manager of the Royal Gorge Bridge, said the historic bridge was not threatened but that homes along Fremont County Road 61 were evacuated.
Bandera said he first saw the flames about 1:30 p.m. Monday, jumping as high as 20 feet into the air.
Overnight, firefighters will continue to monitor the blaze and create fire breaks to minimize the spread. They will fight the fire depending on the direction it is headed, how active it is and on firefighter safety, Cairns said.
Meanwhile, the fire sparked by lightning in the Great Sand Dunes National Park a few weeks ago has engulfed 4,700 acres. Strong winds stoked the blaze.
On the Western Slope, a 170-acre blaze was burning on the Roan Plateau, 10 miles northwest of Rifle.
“It’s a fairly remote, rugged area and not threatening any structures,” said Dave Boyd, spokesman for the Upper Colorado River Interagency Fire Management Unit.
Colorado has about 300 wildfires a year, Boyd said, most of which stay small. A normal fire season is predicted for Colorado this year, Boyd said."
drought,"Hundreds of Indian villages have been evacuated as a historic drought forces families to abandon their homes in search of water.
The country has seen extremely high temperatures in recent weeks. On Monday the capital, Delhi, saw its highest ever June temperature of 48C. In Rajasthan, the city of Churu recently experienced highs of 50.8C, making it the hottest place on the planet.
Further south, less than 250 miles from the country’s commercial capital, Mumbai, village after village lies deserted. Estimates suggest up to 90% of the area’s population has fled, leaving the sick and elderly to fend for themselves in the face of a water crisis that shows no sign of abating.
The village of Hatkarwadi, about 20 miles from Beed in Maharashtra state, is almost completely deserted.
Wells and handpumps have run dry in the 45C heatwave. The drought, which officials say is worse than the 1972 famine that affected 25 million people across the state, began early in December. By the end of May, Hatkarwadi had been deserted with only 10-15 families remaining out of a population of more than 2,000.
With 80% of districts in neighbouring Karnataka and 72% in Maharashtra hit by drought and crop failure, the 8 million farmers in these two states are struggling to survive. More than 6,000 tankers supply water to villages and hamlets in Maharashtra daily, as conflict brews between the two states over common water resources.
The acute water shortage has devastated villagers’ agriculture-based livelihood. Crops have withered and died, leaving livestock starving and with little to drink. Major crops, including maize, soya, cotton, sweet lime, pulses and groundnuts – drivers of the local economy – have suffered."
Typhoon,"Eight months after Hurricane Laura devastated southwest Louisiana, the state transportation department has finished removing storm debris from state roadways.
The Department of Transportation and Development said it wrapped up removal of 1.4 million cubic yards of debris Tuesday in Calcasieu Parish, one of the hardest hit areas from Laura in August and the follow-up blow of Hurricane Delta in October.
The cleanup of debris from the 2020 storms on state roadways in other parishes already had been completed.
The transportation department said contractors statewide removed 3.3 million cubic yards of hurricane debris. Two-thirds of that was cleaned up in the southwestern Louisiana parishes of Allen, Beauregard, Calcasieu, Cameron and Jefferson Davis."
drought,"From ground level, Australia's drought looks like a featureless brown dustbowl, but from the air it transforms into an artistry of colour and texture as the land cracks under a blazing sun.
Circular dry plough tracks resemble the concentric circles in Aboriginal dot paintings that tell of an ancient mythology, starving cattle queuing for feed look like an abstract painting, and their black shadows stretching across the land a surrealist image.
But for farmer Ash Whitney there is no such beauty, just blood, sweat and tears as he struggles to feed his cattle, cutting the drying branches of Kurrajong trees – a last resort during the worst of droughts.
“I have been here all my life, and this drought is feeling like it will be around a while,” says a despairing Whitney, whose property near the town of Gunnedah is on the Liverpool Plains – a usually fertile area now withered, having received the lowest average rainfall in nearly 30 years.
The worst drought in living memory is sweeping parts of eastern Australia, leaving farmers struggling to cope and asking questions about the future.
Cattle farmer Tom Wollaston, born 70 years ago in the same house he lives in today, is afraid for what this drought will mean for his children, who aim to takeover the 2,300 hectare (5,683 acre) property when Tom “hangs up his boots”.
“I can't seem to be able to do anything else apart from just feed, and keep things going. The drought seems to be one step ahead of me all the time. We'll battle it out, but it puts a strain on everyone,” says Wollaston.
His wife Margo says droughts have a very negative impact, not only on her family but on the whole farming community around the nearby town of Tamworth in northwest New South Wales (NSW) state.
“I find droughts a little bit like cancer – it sort of eats away at you, and it just gets drier and drier and more severe and more severe, and impacting on your life a lot worse. I do try really hard to keep the house and the garden clean and green because that keeps your head in the right space at night time”.
May McKeown, 79, and her son Jimmie live on a property near the northwest NSW town of Walgett and say they are extremely worried about the future, having had almost no rain since 2010.
“My great grandfather settled on this land in 1901, and he never had to remove cattle from the paddocks over there,” she says pointing to the west. “But we have had to remove them all and bring them closer to the homestead so we can more easily feed them.”"
drought,"As parts of the Western US emerge from one of the driest winter seasons on record, the expectation of yet another summer of wildfires will be familiar to many.
Scientists, in fact, are already issuing warnings of an increased risk of wildfires in places such as California for 2021, and other parts of the Western US, as the San Francisco Chronicle recently reported.
The region, where wildfires are increasingly common, is ripe for wildfires following a winter with extremely dry conditions – and reportedly the third worst ever seen.
And it could for a single reason – what is being described by scientists as the second worst drought for 1,200 years.
The Western US, a region at the front of the world’s fight against a warming climate, is on the verge of a “mega drought”, according to a report by CBS, following analysis of the US Drought Monitor and warnings from scientists.
And it could for a single reason – what is being described by scientists as the second worst drought for 1,200 years.
The Western US, a region at the front of the world’s fight against a warming climate, is on the verge of a “mega drought”, according to a report by CBS, following analysis of the US Drought Monitor and warnings from scientists.
The period of so-called “mega drought”, of which the consequences are only starting to be seen, is thought to have begun in 2000, with peaks in periods of severe drought – and wildfires.
As shown in figures from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the period was responsible for the two worst droughts to occur, in 2003 and 2013.
Figures for 2020-2021 are more alarming, with the amount of area being in a state of ""exceptional drought"" at 20 per cent – wider than at any point for 20 years.

earthquake,"SANTIAGO, CHILE - A 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck Saturday off the coast of Antarctica, with authorities issuing a tsunami warning for Chile's Eduardo Frei base on the frigid continent, emergency officials said.
The quake struck at 8:36 p.m. local time (2336 GMT) about 210 kilometers east of the base at a depth of 10 kilometers, Chile's National Emergency Office (Onemi) said, urging evacuation from ""the beach area of the Antarctic"" ahead of a possible tsunami.
The Chilean air force's base is the country's largest in Antarctica and includes a village, hospital, school, bank, post office and chapel.
The maximum population in summer is 150 people, and the average population in winter is 80.
An unrelated 5.9-magnitude earthquake struck near Santiago on Saturday night, but Onemi said no significant damage or impact was reported.
Chile is one of the most seismically active countries in the world. An 8.8 magnitude temblor in Concepcion on February 27, 2010, left more than 500 dead.
The country suffered the most powerful earthquake ever recorded 60 years ago — measuring 9.6 magnitude — in Valdivia."
wildfires,"Dozens of wildfires raging in rain-starved Texas are now reported to have engulfed more than 1,000 homes.

Typhoon,"Hurricane season may kick off early, with the potential for the year's first named storm to form off the coast of Florida and the Bahamas.
Tropical (or, potentially, Subtropical) Storm Arthur, as it will be called if conditions develop into a named storm system - has a 70 per cent chance of forming over the next five days, according to the US National Hurricane Center.
In order for a tropical storm to become a hurricane, it has to establish a warm core, which then must intensify into hurricane-force winds.
Hurricane season usually begins on 1 June, but the storm season is starting early this year due in part to the above-average temperatures across the Atlantic ocean. In addition to its early start, meteorologists are predicting this year will have an especially active hurricane season, with most expecting more than six named hurricanes, and some meteorologists predicting more than nine.
The Orlando Sentinel reported that Floridians aren't likely to be overly affected by the storm. Speaking to Jayme King, a meteorologist for local news station Fox 35, the paper reported that Floridians can expect a 40 to 50 per cent chance of rain on Friday near Orlando, with heavier rainfall in the south of the state.
In addition to heavy rain, dangerous surf and tropical-storm force winds - 39-73mph (34 to 63 knots) - are expected."

Typhoon,"Hurricane Sally made landfall near Gulf Shores, Alabama in the early hours of Wednesday morning as a Category 2, bringing a storm surge and more than 2 feet (60cm) of rain.
The northern eyewall brought hurricane-strength winds across the Gulf coast from Pensacola Beach in Florida through to Dauphin Island, Alabama.
Almost 650,000 customers are without power across three states.
The slow speed of the system, moving at just 3mph, and the amount of rain falling, could seriously exacerbate flooding, which is already widespread across the region. A flash flood emergency remains in place until 5.30pm CDT and people are advised to not travel unless fleeing an area subject to flooding.
Pensacola, Florida, currently has between three and four feet of water in its streets and more rainfall is expected. Much of downtown is impassable, and part of the brand-new Three Mile Bridge to the city of Gulf Breeze is now ""missing,"" according to the National Weather Service (NWS) forecast office in Mobile. A barge has reportedly also struck the bridge.
FEMA has pre-positioned more than 1.8 million meals and 1.5 million bottles of water in response to the hurricane. 
It is the eighth named storm to reach landfall on American shores this year, reportedly breaking a 104-year old record last set when seven storms landed in 1916’s storm season.  "

earthquake,"Hundreds of aftershocks hit British Columbia including a 6.4-magnitude tremor Sunday afternoon,following one of the strongest earthquakes to the area in decades.
The province’s coastline was walloped with a 7.7-magnitude earthquake just after 8 p.m. PT Saturday. The U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake struck at a depth of 17 kilometres centred 139 km south of Masset in the Haida Gwaii region.
Residents inVancouver’s mainland felt the intense quake with smaller tremors reaching the Greater Vancouver Area. Peopleas far as Edmonton, Alberta also reportedly feelingaftershocks well into Sunday. Tremors are expected to continue for days but many will go unnoticed.
The quake prompted a number of tsunami warnings along the province’s coastand as far away as Hawaii and California, but all were called off Sunday.
Still no reports of injuries or significant damages have been reported aside from personal belongings broken and misplaced from the tremors.
Tsunami warnings were issued for a large stretch of the North and Central coast, as well as the Haida Gwaii region. These Tsunami warnings prompted some residents to evacuate their homes. Haida Gwaii and other coastal communities such as Tofino sought out higher ground.

earthquake,"Residents of Cape Town have been left shook after a 6.2 magnitude earthquake rocked the region on Saturday night. The substantial tremor rumbled many in the south-west, with residents of Melkbosstrand bearing the brunt of the seismic event.
The actual quake happened some 1 800km offshore, deep in the South Atlantic Ocean. Residents have reported feeling the effects, with houses shaking and the ground moving. Despite taking locals by surprise, it seems the after-effects will be minimal at worst.
The US Geological Survey has concluded that there will be a ‘low threat to life’, due to the earthquake’s strength. Although 6.2 on the Richter Scale does mark a significant event for Cape Town, it’s unlikely that it will trigger a tsunami or any follow-up damage."
