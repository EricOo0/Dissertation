earthquake,"The earthquake unleashed dozens of aftershocks, some six kilometres northeast of the city of Majene,  causing heavy damage across the city, including to the five-story Mitra Manakarra Hospital where eight people were reportedly trapped inside.  
“The Governor’s office, two hotels, a mall, a community health centre, and over 300 houses also sustained damage”, said the spokesperson for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Jens Laerke. 
Local authorities have reported that 638 people have been injured and more than 18,000 have been temporarily displaced to 10 evacuation sites.  
However, these numbers are expected to increase as assessments continue.  
“The earthquake interrupted the access road between?Majene?and the provincial capital?Mamuju?in three different locations”, said Mr. Laerke.  
“Electricity, communications network and fuel supply have also been disrupted”, he added.
The OCHA spokesperson pointed out that the earthquake?followed?a 5.7 magnitude shock that rocked the same area on Thursday afternoon.? 
The chief of Indonesia’s Meteorology and Geophysics agency, Dwikorita Karnawati, warned that strong aftershocks could follow, telling a news conference that there had already been at least 26, after the two quakes had rocked the area, since Thursday afternoon. 
“The structures of the materials and rocks under the earth are unstable or weak after 28 tremors, and these may cause an underwater landslide and trigger a tsunami”, she said, recommending that people stay away from the coast if another strong quake strikes. "
earthquake,"Thousands flee for safety and higher ground after island’s second quake in 24 hours
At least 37 people have been killed and hundreds injured following a strong earthquake that shook the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia early on Friday morning, prompting landslides and destroying houses.
Thousands of people fled their homes to seek safety when the 6.2-magnitude earthquake hit just after 1am local time on Friday morning. The epicentre was 6km north-east of Majene city in West Sulawesi.
Hundreds of buildings were destroyed or damaged, including a hospital, which collapsed with more than a dozen patients and staff trapped beneath it.
“The hospital is flattened,” said Arianto, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, from the rescue agency in Mamuju city, near Majene. Rescuers were also trying to reach a family of eight buried beneath the rubble of their destroyed home, he told AFP.
At least 37 people have been killed in Majene and Mamuju, and rescue workers fear the death toll will rise further. “Many of the dead are buried under rubble,” said Ali Rahman, the head of the local disaster mitigation agency in Mamuju. In Majene, 637 people were said to be injured."
earthquake,"On 15 January 2021, a 6.2 magnitude earthquake hit Majene, West Sulawesi Province in the early hours of the morning killing at least 81?people, injuring more than 630, and over 15,000 homeless.

Thousands were evacuated from some coastal areas of the North Island after the third, 8.1-magnitude quake struck.
There were reports of traffic gridlock as people tried to reach higher ground.
The national tsunami warning was lifted at 15:43 (02:43 GMT), some 13 hours after the first quake.
Some wave surges hit parts of the coast but, by Friday afternoon, authorities said the largest waves had passed. Residents were told they could return home but were warned to stay off beaches."
earthquake,"One of the strongest earthquakes to hit the South Pacific in modern history triggered tsunami warnings across the ocean and forced thousands of people in New Zealand to evacuate coastal areas Friday. Small tsunami waves were seen, but little damage was apparent hours later.
The magnitude 8.1 quake in the Kermadec Islands region about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) from New Zealand was the largest in a series of tremors over several hours, including two earlier quakes that registered magnitude 7.4 and magnitude 7.3.
The tsunami threat caused traffic jams and some chaos in New Zealand as people scrambled to get to higher ground.
Residents recorded videos of small wave surges in some places, including at Tokomaru Bay near Gisborne. In the afternoon, the National Emergency Management Agency said the threat had passed and people could return to their homes, although they should continue avoiding beaches.
One of the earlier quakes hit much closer to New Zealand and awoke many people as they felt a long, rumbling shaking. “Hope everyone is ok out there,” New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern wrote on Facebook during the night."

earthquake,"SANTIAGO, CHILE - A 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck Saturday off the coast of Antarctica, with authorities issuing a tsunami warning for Chile's Eduardo Frei base on the frigid continent, emergency officials said.
The quake struck at 8:36 p.m. local time (2336 GMT) about 210 kilometers east of the base at a depth of 10 kilometers, Chile's National Emergency Office (Onemi) said, urging evacuation from ""the beach area of the Antarctic"" ahead of a possible tsunami.
The Chilean air force's base is the country's largest in Antarctica and includes a village, hospital, school, bank, post office and chapel.
The maximum population in summer is 150 people, and the average population in winter is 80.
An unrelated 5.9-magnitude earthquake struck near Santiago on Saturday night, but Onemi said no significant damage or impact was reported.
Chile is one of the most seismically active countries in the world. An 8.8 magnitude temblor in Concepcion on February 27, 2010, left more than 500 dead.
The country suffered the most powerful earthquake ever recorded 60 years ago — measuring 9.6 magnitude — in Valdivia."
earthquake,"Early on Tuesday morning, a powerful magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck near the coast of Northern Chile. The first seismic activity recorded was located 48km from Huasco at 5.30am (UK time), according to US Geological Survey (USGS). Bolivia, Chile and Argentina were all affected.
The GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences reported that had been some damage and minor landslides but no apparent fatalities. Communities close to the coastline were evacuated, though fortunately, a tsunami was not triggered.
After the initial quake, aftershocks between magnitudes 5 and 6.1 were reported. Many more could be expected in the coming days, and even weeks. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no tsunami threat from the earthquake.
Chile's National Emergency Office of the Ministry of the Interior and Public Security said the event was unlikely to cause major disruption to services or infrastructure, though some places were disturbed. An image shared on social media shows a shaken supermarket after the event.
The quake was revealed to be at a depth of 10km (which equates to around 6.2 miles), and connected to underlying fault movement along a subduction zone."
earthquake,"An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 struck off southern Alaska's coast late Tuesday, shaking the Alaska Peninsula and briefly sparking tsunami concerns before officials said no destructive waves were coming.
The earthquake was centered in the Pacific Ocean about 60 miles southeast of Perryville on the sparsely populated Alaska Peninsula, striking around 10:12 p.m. local time (2:12 a.m. Wednesday ET).
The Alaska Peninsula protrudes from mainland Alaska and is flanked to the southwest by the Aleutian Islands.
Reports of significant damage, if any, weren't immediately available. A tsunami warning initially was issued for south Alaska and the Alaska Peninsula, but was canceled by early Wednesday, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The warning sent people to higher ground in cities like Sand Point, an island community of about 1,000 people off the peninsula, the Anchorage Daily News reported.
People in Sand Point gathered at a high school until shortly after midnight, when officials gave an all-clear, Jordan Keeler, an Anchorage-based city administrator, told the newspaper.
""The first wave didn't materialize, which is a great thing,"" Keeler, who was in contact with staff in Sand Point, told the Anchorage Daily News. No reports of major structural damage were made on the island, Keeler told the newspaper.
""We've canceled the (tsunami) advisories because it doesn't look like it's becoming a large wave or any larger,"" National Tsunami Warning Center Director James Gridley said, according to CNN affiliate KTUU.
Strong shaking was reported on the peninsula, the USGS said. Light to weak shaking was reported around Kodiak, about 300 miles northeast of the quake's center, and in Anchorage, some 530 miles from the center, according to the USGS.
In Kodiak, a city of about 6,000 people, a long line of cars headed up a mountain after residents learned of the tsunami warning late Tuesday, John Cannon told KTUU.
Police were ""trying to clear the lower areas down by the harbor,"" he said.
""You (could) hear the tsunami alarms. It's rather eerie,"" he told KTUU.
This quake's depth was 28 kilometers, or 17 miles, the USGS said -- relatively shallow.
""Anything below 70 kilometers is considered a shallow quake,"" CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar said. ""That's important, because shallow earthquakes often cause the most damage, compared to the ones that are deeper, regardless of the strength.""
More than 20 aftershocks followed the quake late Tuesday to early Wednesday, ranging from magnitudes of 2.8 to 6.1."
earthquake,"CANBERRA, Australia -- A strong, deep earthquake shook inland Papua New Guinea on Friday, and officials said there were no immediate reports of casualties or major damage.
Shaking was felt in the capital Port Moresby but not strongly.
The U.S. Geological Survey said the 7.0 magnitude quake was 80 kilometers (53 miles) deep. Shallower quakes tend to cause more surface damage.
The epicenter was close to Morobe Patrol Post, with a population of 15,000 in Morobe province. Locals reported on social media the wharf at Morobe Patrol Post had “cracked in half.""
Some damage was reported on social media in coastal villages. Residents were advised to go inland if there were any sign of tidal changes or irregular ocean patterns.
Mark Maniaol, a hotel employee in Lae, the capital of Morobe and the country's second-largest city, said he left the quake but it was not severe. He was not aware of any damage in the city.
The Morobe Provincial Disaster Office Director Charley Masange said he did not expect to receive damage reports from the epicenter until Saturday.
“The epicenter is in the mountains. Not many people live there and it's very remote so it takes a long time to get information,” Manage said. “I'm not expecting major damage.”
Papua New Guinea is prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions because it lies along the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” the string of faults around the Pacific Ocean where most of the world's seismic activity occurs."
earthquake,"A magnitude-5.2 earthquake occurred in central Papua New Guinea, at around 2016 Dec. 18. The epicenter was in northeastern Morobe Province, approximately 67 km (42 miles) northeast of Lae. The tremor occurred at a depth of about 47 km (29 miles). Weak-to-light shaking was probably felt throughout Morobe Province, eastern sections of Eastern Highlands Province, southeastern areas of Madang Province, and western parts of Western New Britain Province. There have been no initial reports of damage or casualties as a result of the earthquake. It could take several hours until authorities can conduct comprehensive damage assessments, especially in remote areas. Aftershocks are possible over the coming days.
Officials may temporarily shut down transportation infrastructure in the tremor zone to check for damage. Minor disruptions could occur during shutdowns, but service will likely resume quickly if officials find no damage. Utility outages are possible, particularly near the earthquake's epicenter and coastal areas of affected provinces. Landslides are possible in mountain areas and could block roads, exacerbating ground transport disruptions."

More than 100 people were killed when a 6.2-magnitude quake rocked the small city of Mamuju on Sulawesi island last month.
In 2018, a 7.5-magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami on Sulawesi island left more than 4,300 people dead or missing.
A devastating 9.1-magnitude quake struck off the coast of Sumatra in 2004, triggering a tsunami that killed 220,000 throughout the region, including around 170,000 in Indonesia -- one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history."
earthquake,"A strong earthquake with 6.3 magnitude struck the southern province of Davao del Sur in the Philippines on Sunday, with damage and aftershocks expected, the country's seismology agency said.
The earthquake was initially recorded at magnitude 6 at a depth of 10 km (6.2 miles), the GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences earlier said.
The Philippines Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Philvolcs) said it recorded the depth at 15 km, adding that the earthquake was tectonic.
The Southeast Asian country is on the geologically active Pacific Ring of Fire and experiences frequent earthquakes, particularly in the south."
earthquake," A 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck Saturday off the coast of Antarctica, with authorities issuing a tsunami warning for Chile's Eduardo Frei base on the frigid continent, emergency officials said.
The quake struck at 8:36 pm (2336 GMT) about 210 kilometers (130 miles) east of the base at a depth of 10 kilometers (6 miles), Chile's National Emergency Office (Onemi) said, urging evacuation from ""the beach area of the Antarctic"" ahead of a possible tsunami.
The Chilean Air Force's base is the country's largest in Antarctica, and includes a village, hospital, school, bank, post office and chapel.
The maximum population in summer is 150 people, and the average population in winter is 80.
An unrelated 5.9-magnitude earthquake struck near Santiago on Saturday night, but Onemi said no significant damage or impact was reported.
Chile is one of the most seismically active countries in the world. A 8.8-magniture temblor in the city of Concepcion on February 27, 2010 left more than 500 dead.
The country suffered the most powerful earthquake ever recorded 60 years ago -- measuring 9.6 magnitude -- in the city of Valdivia."
earthquake,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- One of the biggest earthquakes to hit the South Pacific in modern history forced thousands of people in New Zealand to evacuate and triggered tsunami warnings across the world Friday, but it did not appear to cause injuries or major damage because it struck in remote ocean.
The magnitude 8.1 quake was the largest in a series of tremors that hit the region over several hours, including two earlier quakes that registered magnitude 7.4 and magnitude 7.3.
The earthquakes triggered warning systems and caused traffic jams and some chaos in New Zealand as people scrambled to get to higher ground, but their remoteness meant they did not appear to pose a widespread threat to lives or infrastructure.
The largest quake struck about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) off the coast of New Zealand. One of the earlier quakes hit much closer to New Zealand and awoke many people as they felt a long, rumbling shaking.
“Hope everyone is ok out there,” New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern wrote on Facebook during the night.
After the largest quake, civil defense authorities in New Zealand told people in some coastal areas to immediately get to higher ground. They said a damaging tsunami was possible, and waves could reach up to 3 meters (10 feet).
Emergency Management Minister Kiri Allan told reporters that people had followed the advisory.
“They felt the long or strong earthquakes and they knew to grab their bag and head into the highlands,” she said. “I can only thank and acknowledge the tireless efforts of the men and women from up and down the coast who knew how to act, when to act, and what to do.”
She warned that the threat could remain throughout much of the afternoon and people should not return home until authorities gave the all-clear. Allan said evacuations took precedence over coronavirus distancing measures.
The U.S. Tsunami Warning System also cautioned the quake could cause tsunami waves of up to 3 meters (10 feet) in Vanuatu and up to 1 meter (3 feet) in Australia, Fiji, French Polynesia and as far away as Mexico and Peru.
The U.S. Geological Survey said it was centered near the remote Kermadec Islands at a depth of 19 kilometers (12 miles).
The agency said in a report that the quake occurred at the intersection of the Pacific and Australia tectonic plates and eclipsed the largest quake previously recorded in the region, a magnitude 8.0 in 1976.
It said the interaction between the plates creates one of the most seismically active regions in the world, and it has recorded 215 quakes there above magnitude 6.0 over the past century.
Jennifer Eccles, an earthquake expert at the University of Auckland, said the quake was at the top end of the scale for those involving only the Earth's ocean crust.
“This is about as big as it gets,” she said.
She said most quakes larger than magnitude 8.0 tend to occur when a section of more robust continental crust is involved.
The U.S. Geological Survey said the magnitude 7.4 quake was likely a “foreshock” that contributed to the larger quake but that the first quake that hit closer to New Zealand was too far away in time and distance to have directly contributed.
Officials in New Zealand had hours earlier issued a tsunami warning for coastal areas after the first quake struck off its northeastern coast at about 2:30 a.m. Friday. There were no immediate reports of serious damage or casualties, and the warning was lifted just before the largest quake hit.
The U.S. Geological Survey said the first quake was centered at a depth of 21 kilometers (13 miles) under the ocean about 174 kilometers (108 miles) northeast of the city of Gisborne.
It was widely felt in New Zealand, and residents in the major cities of Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch reported being shaken awake.
In 2011, a magnitude 6.3 quake hit the city of Christchurch, killing 185 people and destroying much of its downtown."
earthquake,"A powerful aftershock with magnitude 5.9 caused additional damage in central Greece Thursday, a day after an earthquake damaged hundreds of homes in the same area.
Authorities said some empty houses, which had been abandoned by their inhabitants after suffering damage Wednesday, collapsed but no injuries were reported.
According to the Athens Geodynamic Institute, the aftershock struck as night fell Thursday outside the central town of Elasona, some 365 kilometers (225 miles) northwest of the Greek capital.
Local authorities advised people in the area to remain outdoors for a second night.
“We are advising people not to return to their homes in the area near the epicenter,” said Efthymios Lekkas, head of the state-run Earthquake Planning and Protection Organization.
“This latest event came from a section of the faultline that we had not considered to be active. It surprised us.”
The army set up tents in the area Wednesday after a 6.0-magnitude earthquake jolted the region and was felt as far as Montenegro, some 500 kilometers (310 miles) to the north.
It caused no serious injuries, but scores of homes were damaged in several villages near Elasona."
earthquake,"An estimated magnitude 4.2 earthquake was recorded Friday in a rural area along Oklahoma's border with Kansas, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
The earthquake was recorded at 7:56 a.m. near Manchester, a town of about 100 residents about 100 miles (161 kilometers) north of Oklahoma City, the USGS reported.
Grant County Commissioner Max Hess, whose district includes Manchester, said no injuries or damage were reported.
The rural area in northern Oklahoma is about 55 miles (89 kilometers) northwest of where a recent series of earthquakes were recorded. Geologists say those quakes were likely connected to the underground injection of wastewater that is produced by oil and gas companies.
In response to the quakes, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission ordered oil and gas operators to stop disposal of wastewater within 3 miles (5 kilometers) of the earthquake epicenters and to reduce disposal volumes within 3 to 10 miles (5 to 16 kilometers) of the epicenters."
earthquake," A series of aftershocks jolted central Croatia on Wednesday, a day after a 6.3-magnitude earthquake killed at least seven people, injured dozens and left several towns and villages in ruins.
Authorities warned that the coronavirus could spread in crowded shelters. Many people are in tents, their cars or military barracks.
The strongest, 4.7-magnitude tremor was recorded near the heavily damaged town of Petrinja, some 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of the capital, Zagreb.
Neven Pavkovic, a resident, said the aftershocks kept him awake: ""It was a rough night, I slept maybe half an hour.”
In the hard-hit village of Majske Poljane, where five people died, a little boy could be seen sleeping in a van on the chilly morning.
Sobbing villagers said they received blankets, food and other aid but don’t know what they will do next. Rain that fell overnight turned the dust from the rubble into mud, adding to the hardship.
“We can’t say ‘Good morning,’ It is not good,” Petrinja mayor Darinko Dumbovic told Croatian radio. “We had the third and fourth tremors this morning, short ones but strong. What hasn’t fallen off before is falling now from the ruins of Petrinja.”
“Fear has crept into people,"" he said.
Pope Francis prayed for the victims. At the end of his weekly audience, he said: ”I particularly pray for those who died and for their families.”
Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said the government will declare Saturday a day of national mourning. As the government abolished a travel ban between counties that was imposed during the holidays because of the coronavirus pandemic, Plenkovic appealed for respect for other measures.
“We are still fighting COVID-19, it wouldn’t be good to relax now,” Plenkovic said at a government session.
The International Committee of the Red Cross said it had deployed its Croatian staff in the quake-hit area, and warned of the possible spread of the coronavirus amid the emergency.
“Hundreds of people who were forced to leave their homes are accommodated in communal buildings and tents, while others are seeking shelter in different parts of the country, increasing the risk of transmission,"" a statement said.
Croatian officials said a 12-year-old girl died in Petrinja, a town of some 25,000 people. At least 26 people were hospitalized with injuries.
Tuesday's quake, the strongest in Croatia since the introduction of the modern seismic measurement system, was felt throughout the region, including neighboring Bosnia, Serbia and Slovenia.
The central Croatian region was also struck by a 5.2 earthquake on Monday."
Typhoon,"MANILA — Super Typhoon Goni, the world's most powerful storm in four years, crashed through the Philippines on Sunday, smashing buildings, toppling trees, and causing floods and mudslides. At least 10 people were reported dead as of Monday morning.
Peak winds were estimated at 195 mph early Sunday before Goni slammed into Catanduanes Island, home to more than 260,000 people. Those winds, equivalent to those of a strong Category 5 hurricane, made the storm comparable to Super Typhoon Haiyan, the catastrophic cyclone that devastated Tacloban City in the Philippines in 2013 and killed more than 6,000 people. The winds were similar to those of Typhoon Meranti, which struck the Philippines in 2016.
Goni landed in a country already reeling from two typhoons in the past two weeks, the coronavirus pandemic, a recession and a record unemployment rate this year."
Typhoon,"Typhoon Goni is barrelling across the Philippines, bringing with it ""catastrophic"" winds and rain.
At least 10 people have died amid reports of storm surges, flash floods, power outages and blown-off roofs.
Goni made landfall as a super typhoon at Catanduanes island on Sunday at 04:50 local time (19:50 GMT Saturday) packing winds of 225km/h (140mph).
It has since weakened, but is still wreaking damage across the main Luzon island, home to the capital Manila.
President Rodrigo Duterte is monitoring the disaster response from his home in Davao city, a presidential spokesman said.
Mark Timbal of the Philippines' national disaster agency said that 19 million people may have been affected by the path of Goni. ""This 19 million already includes the populations in danger zones for landslides, flooding, storm surges and even a lava flow,"" he told the BBC."
Typhoon,"On 1 November 2020, Typhoon Goni made landfall as a super typhoon (Category 5) over Catanduanes with maximum sustained winds of 225 kilometers per hour and gusts of up to 280 kilometers per hour. Its the Philippines’ nineteenth named storm for year 2020. Typhoon Goni is considered as the strongest landfalling tropical cyclone in world recorded history.
At its peak strength on landfall on Catanduanes and Albay, Super Typhoon Goni caused widespread damage to high-risk structures and almost total damage to structures made of light materials in the highly exposed coastal areas. Many roof failures were observed in houses and industrial buildings. Electrical power distribution and communication services were severely disrupted. Water systems were severely damaged. Agriculture and livelihoods were severely affected. In one area, on the slopes, of Mayon Volcano there was a lahar flow that caused the near total destruction of one village."
Typhoon,"Hong Kong may have to brace for a typhoon slamming its large container port this weekend.
A cluster of thunderstorms over the Philippines has the potential to become a typhoon during the next couple of days. This would be the second named storm of the 2020 Pacific typhoon season. The first was Typhoon Vongfong, known as Typhoon Ambo in the Philippines, which hit that island nation in May. The season runs throughout the year, but most Pacific typhoons develop from May through October.
This storm, which would be named Typhoon Nuri, will likely track over the northern Philippines on Friday, June 12, moving into southeastern China over the weekend. The projected track takes the storm close to Hong Kong on Sunday, June 14.
The potential typhoon could delay various services, from container cargo to cruises and public transportation.
Hong Kong is one of the busiest container ports in the world, according to the Hong Kong Maritime and Port Board website. It handled 18.3 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) of containers in 2019, and provided about 300 container liner services per week connecting to around 420 destinations worldwide.The Port of Hong Kong is also home to cruise liners and government fleets, and it operates ferries between Hong Kong and mainland China."
Typhoon,"Typhoon Nuri weakened to a severe tropical storm as it landed in Hong Kong on Friday, bringing strong winds and rainfall but inflicting little damage.
No major destruction was reported, unlike in the Philippines, where Nuri killed seven people and triggered landslides and floods in the north.
But with Nuri landing in Hong Kong late Friday afternoon, the Hong Kong Observatory said it had weakened from a typhoon to a severe tropical storm. By late Friday night, the storm was headed northwest toward the southern Chinese city Guangzhou.
In Hong Kong, a man went missing while swimming off a local beach and 11 people were injured during the storm, with three in serious condition, the government said in a statement.
There also were reports of toppled trees, collapsed walls and scaffoldings.
The Hong Kong Observatory issued its second-highest tropical cyclone warning.
Flights, bus and ferry services were canceled, and offices, schools and financial markets were closed. At least 388 passenger flights were either canceled or delayed and another 15 diverted, the government said in a statement.
Officials have evacuated 87,000 people and recalled more than 45,000 vessels in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
The bad weather didn't affect the Olympic equestrian competition, which finished late Thursday."
Typhoon,"Typhoon Nuri lashed Hong Kong with heavy rain and strong winds sparking major flight delays, disruption to public transport and a halt to trade on the city's financial markets.
Many offices in the southern Chinese territory were closed, and ferry services suspended as meteorologists issued the level-eight storm signal, signifying the likelihood of gale-force winds.
At 11:00 am, the typhoon was centred about 100 kilometres (60 miles) east-southeast of Hong Kong and was moving towards the city at a speed of about 14 kilometres an hour.
""Nuri will be rather close to Hong Kong this afternoon and ON Friday night with a chance of a direct hit,"" a spokesman for the Hong Kong Observatory said.
Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacific and its sister company Dragonair announced that all flights would be cancelled for 12 hours starting at 2:00 pm (0600 GMT).
Organisers of the Olympic equestrian events staged in the city breathed a sigh of relief, as the competition ended Thursday with the show-jumping final."
Typhoon,"On Wednesday, Tropical Storm Butchoy was just a cluster of thunderstorms over that nation. FreightWaves reported on the potential for this storm to intensify, and now mainland China is bracing for impact.
The storm — known as Tropical Storm Nuri in China — will travel across the South China Sea this weekend, maintaining tropical storm status. As of 11 a.m. EDT Friday (11 p.m. Friday Hong Kong time), its sustained winds were 40 mph, with gusts of 50.
The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has issued a T1 tropical cyclone warning. This indicates that a tropical cyclone is centered within 500 miles (800 km) of Hong Kong, which may affect the city and its ports.
Winds and swells in Hong Kong are expected to gradually increase Saturday. The HKO will consider issuing the T3 strong wind warning depending on how badly conditions deteriorate. Meteorologists with the HKO are predicting gale force winds up to 54 mph for Saturday, flirting with severe tropical storm status (55 to 73 mph).
There’s a slim chance Nuri could strengthen into a typhoon — winds of at least 74 mph, like an Atlantic hurricane."
Typhoon,"Hurricane Iota has made landfall in Nicaragua as a Category 4 storm, with the Central American region bracing for the possibility of catastrophic damage.
Iota crossed into Nicaragua near the town of Haulover, approximately 15 miles south of where Hurricane Eta also struck as a Category 4 on Nov. 3.
Nicaragua, along with Honduras, Guatemala, and southern Belize, which are flanked by the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean, are still trying to recover from the widespread devastation caused by Hurricane Eta, which left tens of thousands homeless.
At the time, Eta was the strongest storm to ever hit Nicaragua in the month of November.
The National Hurricane Center has warned of ""catastrophic winds, life-threatening storm surge, and torrential rainfall"" across Central America from the latest storm.
When it made landfall, Iota had sustained winds of 155 mph – a Category 4 hurricane, but by 4 a.m. ET, it had lost strength, becoming a Category 2 storm, with winds at 105 mph, according to the U.S.-based National Hurricane Center. The storm was centered about 10 miles east-northeast of El Pia, Nicaragua. Before making landfall, Iota reached Category 5 for a time.
Besides Iota's incredible strong winds — expected to rip apart roofs and shatter some buildings completely — it is also bringing a massive storm surge, rain and flooding. Water is always the biggest killer in any tropical event and this will be no exception; Iota is a ""bigger"" storm than Eta in terms of how wide the windfield is. That means more people will feel the effects of the storm."
Typhoon,"U.S. forecasters say Hurricane Iota has strengthened to a catastrophic Category 5 storm as it nears landfall with Nicaragua.
In its latest report, the National Hurricane Center says Iota is closing in on Nicaragua, where it is expected to bring “catastrophic winds, life-threatening storm surge, and torrential rainfall.”
Iota, currently packing maximum sustained winds of 260 kilometers per hour, is expected to make landfall in almost the exact location where Hurricane Eta came ashore two weeks ago.
Authorities in Honduras and Nicaragua rushed to evacuate their respective citizens from coastal areas Monday ahead of the storm.
""What's drawing closer is a bomb,"" Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez said at a news conference alongside Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei.
Hurricane Eta killed at least 50 people, destroyed buildings, knocked out power and caused flooding and landslides.
Iota is the record-breaking 30th named storm of the 2020 hurricane season. Along with Eta, it marks the first time that two major hurricanes have formed in the month of November.
It is also the 10th named storm to strengthen by more than 55.5 kph in a 24-hour period. Meteorologists attribute the effect to warm waters in the southern Caribbean."
Typhoon,"While it is difficult to link any individual tropical cyclone to climate change, the UN World Meteorological Organization (WMO) expects to see more powerful storms in future as a result of global warming. 
Laura is the seventh named storm to landfall in the US this season, which has just begun what is traditionally its most intense period. It intensified within 24 hours from a Category 1 to a strong Category 4 on the Saffir Simson hurricane scale.
According to news reports, some 1,500 people are being sent into Louisiana for rescue and clean up missions, including troops from the National Guard. 
Winds of up to 150 mph caused severe damage, including the death of at least six people, and left half a million homes without power.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards tweeted that the hurricane has left roads flooded and wildlife displaced, warning people to stay vigilant."
Typhoon,"Fourteen people are now confirmed dead in the United States after Hurricane Laura battered southern states.
Ten of the victims were in Louisiana and four in Texas.
Winds of up to 150mph (240km/h) caused severe damage, with power cuts to more than half a million homes and a chemical fire from an industrial plant.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards has asked the federal government for immediate financial assistance in dealing with the fallout.
President Donald Trump will travel to the two states on Saturday to meet with people affected by the hurricane, the White House said.
Laura has now been downgraded to tropical storm status, but heavy rain is still falling on several states.
In Haiti, which was earlier badly hit by storms Marco and Laura, at least 31 people are now reported to have died"
Typhoon,"Galveston, Texas: Hurricane Laura made landfall near Cameron in Louisiana on Thursday afternoon (AEST) as one of the region's worst hurricanes, threatening to devastate the US Gulf Coast with catastrophic storm surges, flash floods and powerful winds that could leave areas uninhabitable for weeks or months.
It came ashore as a category four storm with maximum winds of about 240km/h, according to the National Hurricane Centre. Laura is strong enough to rip down houses, uproot trees and cause power outages that could last weeks or even months.The storm is set to push a wall of water more than 6.1 metres high in some places on to shore, with potentially deadly effects - a catastrophic surge the centre earlier described as ""unsurvivable"".
It could inflict more than US15 billion (20 billion) in insured losses.
It is just a few kilometres per hour short of the most powerful storm category possible, and it's matching the previous record-breaker, the Lost Island Hurricane of 1856.
Some additional strengthening is possible before Laura reaches the north-west US Gulf of Mexico coast, the centre said. It's coming with more power than Hurricane Harvey when it made landfall in Texas in 2017.

Typhoon,"Thick mud and debris coated many villages around the Philippine capital on Friday after a typhoon killed at least 42 people and caused extensive flooding that sent people fleeing to their roofs, officials said.
Troops, police, coast guard and disaster-response teams rescued tens of thousands of people, including many who flooded radio and TV networks and social media with desperate pleas for help.
Floodwaters receded and the weather cleared in many areas after Typhoon Vamco blew out into the South China Sea on Friday, but the military said it was still rescuing people trapped in some flooded communities.
Amphibious assault vehicles usually used in counter-insurgency operations were deployed for the rescue work, military chief of staff Gen. Gilbert Gapay said in a meeting with disaster-response officials.
“We’ll continue to look for the missing, help in damage assessment,” Gapay said.
The national police reported that the death toll had risen to at least 42 with 20 missing. The government’s main disaster-response agency, which waits for provincial reports and follows a laborious process of verifying casualties, reported a much lower death count, causing confusion.
Among the dead were at least 12 villagers who were dug out from mud and rockslides in the northern provinces of Cagayan and Nueva Vizcaya, police said.
After slamming into northeastern Quezon province, Vamco gained strength with sustained winds of 155 kilometers (96 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 255 kph (158 mph). It blew north of metropolitan Manila overnight Wednesday, toppling trees and power poles, swelling rivers, flooding residential communities and setting off landslides and storm surges.
In hard-hit Marikina city in the capital region and the towns of Rodriguez and Cainta in nearby Rizal province, several villages were inundated by water that reached the second and third floors of many houses, prompting hundreds of residents to flee to their roofs and call TV and radio networks or post desperate messages on social media. The panic was exacerbated by widespread power outages and loss of internet access.
Videos of Marikina showed a thick coat of muddy water covering roads and staining houses and cars. Residents carried appliances and furniture from their homes and used pails and shovels to remove the mud after the water receded.
In a televised meeting of Cabinet and disaster-response officials Friday, a reporter asked where President Rodrigo Duterte was, prompting an annoyed response from his spokesman."
Typhoon,"A typhoon swelled rivers and flooded low-lying areas as it passed over the storm-battered northeastern Philippines, leaving at least 13 people dead and 15 others missing, officials said Thursday.
The Philippine National Police reported the casualty figures, but gave no details.
Typhoon Vamco passed north of Manila between Bulacan and Pampanga provinces, toppling trees and knocking out power. Officials said earlier that nearly 200,000 people had been evacuated, some forcibly, from vulnerable coastal and low-lying areas.
Officials said about 1.9 million households were without power in Metro Manila and nearby provinces. Many electricity poles were toppled, power lines were knocked down and power transformers were damaged.
President Rodrigo Duterte took a break from an online summit of Southeast Asian leaders to fly by helicopter over the affected areas.
“As president I guarantee you that your government will do its best to provide assistance in the form of shelters, relief goods, financial aid and post-disaster counseling. Rest assured, the government will not leave anybody behind. We will get through this crisis,” Duterte said in a televised address.
Rescue teams were deployed to flooded areas in Rizal province, coast guard chief Adm. George Ursabia told DZBB radio.
Marikina city Mayor Marcie Teodoro said fierce winds knocked down power lines overnight, leaving many areas without power and internet service. Heavy rains also flooded many areas and the Marikina River was swollen. Many people in Marikina city were waiting to be rescued from roofs.
“There are many areas that historically don’t get flooded but now they are swamped, like city hall,” he told DZBB radio.
Mark Timbal, spokesman for the government’s disaster response agency, said 363 rescue teams had been deployed consisting of 1,000 rescuers with at least 40 rubber boats.
The typhoon had maximum sustained winds of 130 kilometers per hour (80 mph) with stronger gusts Thursday morning. It was moving west-northwest at 30 kph (19 mph) and was headed for the South China Sea.
The government’s main disaster-response agency had pleaded to the media to relay typhoon alerts in northeastern areas devastated by an earlier typhoon, Goni, saying the agency’s messages could not be sent by cellphones due to damaged telecommunications systems.
Goni, one of the strongest typhoons in the world this year, left more than 30 people dead or missing and damaged or destroyed more than 270,000 houses, many in coastal villages. Tens of thousands of people remain displaced.
The Philippines is hit by about 20 typhoons and tropical storms each year. It is located on the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are common, making it one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries."
Typhoon,"At least 20 people were killed as Typhoon Goni lashed the Philippines over the weekend, and about 13,000 shanties and houses were damaged or swept away in the eastern island province that was first hit by the ferocious storm, officials said Monday.
Goni blasted into Catanduanes province at dawn Sunday as a super typhoon with sustained winds of 225 kilometers (140 miles) per hour and gusts of 280 kph (174 mph). But it weakened considerably after making landfall and shifted direction to spare the capital, Manila, before blowing out into the South China Sea.
The Office of Civil Defense said at least 20 people were killed in Catanduanes and nearby Albay province.
Catanduanes, an island province of more than 260,000 people that is often lashed by Pacific storms, was isolated after losing power and communications due to Goni and another typhoon that had hit a week earlier. But officials there managed to connect to the outside world on Monday after disaster-response authorities flew to the devastated island with satellite phones.
Catanduanes Gov. Joseph Cua and other officials said the typhoon whipped up 5-meter (16-foot) storm surges and damaged or swept away about 13,000 houses. Many residents fled to safety from their homes as the typhoon approached.
More than 66,000 other houses and huts were damaged elsewhere in the region, officials said.
Cua described the onslaught as “severe” and reported that some coastal areas were swamped by frightening storm surges.
About 80% of the electricity posts on the island were toppled and roads linking the province’s 11 towns remained impassable, Cua said.
An army general on the island appealed for more troops to help distribute food packs and water to residents. He added that the army camp was destroyed by the typhoon and soldiers have camped out at the airport, which remained open.
An air force cargo plane was to deliver food packs, drinking water, blankets and other relief goods to the province.
The typhoon also devastated the nearby province of Albay, where heavy rains washed down boulders and mudflows from Mayon Volcano, engulfing about 150 houses in a single community in the town of Guinobatan, Albay Gov. Al Francis Bichara said."
Typhoon,"A super typhoon blew into the eastern Philippines with disastrous force Sunday, killing at least 10 people and triggering volcanic mudflows that engulfed about 150 houses before weakening as it blew away from the country, officials said.
Typhoon Goni blasted into the eastern island province of Catanduanes at dawn from the Pacific with sustained winds of 225 kilometers (140 miles) per hour and gusts of 280 kph (174 mph), threatening some provinces still recovering from a deadly typhoon that hit a week ago.
Goni barreled through densely populated regions and threatened to sideswipe Manila, which shut down its main airport, but shifted southward Sunday night and spared the capital, the government weather agency said.
At least nine people were killed in the hard-hit province of Albay, including a father and son. Villagers fled to safety as the typhoon approached, but the two apparently stayed put in the community in Guinobatan town where about 150 houses were inundated by volcanic mudflow.
“The child was found 15 kilometers (9 miles) away,” Albay Gov. Al Francis Bichara told DZMM radio, adding that the boy was swept away by mudflows and found in the next town.
He did not say whether there were any other residents trapped by the rampaging mudflows in the community and added that downed communications made it hard for people to communicate. The Office of Civil Defense reported that three Guinobatan residents were missing, but it was not immediately clear if they were from the mudflow-hit community.
The other deaths in Albay included a villager who was pinned by a fallen tree. One person was killed in Catanduanes province.

Ricardo Jalad, who heads the government’s disaster-response agency, had feared that the typhoon could wreak major damage due to its enormous force. The Philippine weather agency reinforced those concerns, saying that within 12 hours after the typhoon’s landfall, people could face “catastrophic, violent winds and intense to torrential rainfall.”
Residents were warned of possible landslides, massive flooding, storm surges of up to 5 meters (16 feet) and powerful winds that can blow away shanties. But after hitting a mountain range and repeatedly slamming into coastal provinces, the typhoon gradually weakened, although it remained potentially deadly as it blew out into the South China Sea, forecasters said.
One of the most powerful typhoons in the world this year, Goni evoked memories of Typhoon Haiyan, which left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million in the central Philippines in November 2013."
Typhoon,"A typhoon that officials said was the most powerful to hit Vietnam in 20 years blew away from the country on Thursday after setting off landslides, sinking boats and knocking out power to at least 1.7 million people. At least 35 people were killed and more than 50 were missing, state media said.
The immediate focus for rescuers was on three villages in the country’s central region where landslides killed at least 19 people and are suspected of burying more than 40 others in thick mud and debris.
Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung traveled to the site of one landslide where soldiers were working to clear debris with bulldozers and he ordered officers to urgently send more troops to help with the efforts."
Typhoon,"Typhoon Molave slammed into Vietnam with destructive force Wednesday, killing at least two people and sinking two fishing boats with 26 crew members in what was feared to be the most powerful storm to hit the country in 20 years.
Winds of up to 150 kilometers (93 miles) per hour killed a man by knocking him off his roof as he was trying to reinforce it in south-central Quang Ngai province. Another man was pinned to death by a fallen tree in the coastal province, the official Vietnam News Agency reported.
The navy deployed two rescue boats to search for the 26 fishermen off Binh Dinh province, according to state-run VTV network. It was not immediately clear if anyone was saved in the storm-tossed waters."
Typhoon," A fast-moving typhoon blew away from the Philippines on Monday after leaving at least 13 people missing, forcing thousands of villagers to flee to safety and flooding rural villages, disaster-response officials said.
The 13 people missing from Typhoon Molave included a dozen fishermen who ventured out to sea over the weekend despite a no-sail restriction due to very rough seas. There were no immediate reports of casualties.
The typhoon was blowing west toward the South China Sea with sustained winds of 125 kilometers (77 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 150 kph (93 mph). It roared overnight through island provinces south of the capital, Manila, which was lashed by strong winds but escaped major damage.
At least 25,000 villagers were displaced, with about 20,000 taking shelter in schools and government buildings that were turned into evacuation centers, the Office of Civil Defense said, but officials added that some have returned home in regions where the weather has cleared."
Typhoon,"Tropical Storm Chan-hom brought powerful winds and rain to southern Japan on Saturday, with the weather bureau warning of landslides and flooding in most of the country.
The storm, packing sustained winds of up to 107 kilometers (67 miles) per hour, was moving in waters south of Japan, near the main southwestern island of Shikoku.
It had been downgraded from a typhoon earlier in the week. It was expected to hover eastward, affecting Honshu as well as smaller islands such as Izu by early Sunday.
The storm was not expected to seriously affect Tokyo or make direct landfall.
Weather forecasts warned of a heavy downpour and fierce winds, which may cause rivers to swell and towering waves in coastal areas as well as mudslides."
Typhoon,"A typhoon approaching Japan could bring heavy rains to the Tokyo region over the weekend, weather officials said Thursday, urging residents to take precautions early.
Typhoon Chan-hom was 260 kilometers (160 miles) southeast of Japan’s southern island of Tanegashima on Thursday evening with maximum winds of 126 kilometers (78 miles) per hour, the Meteorological Agency said.
Chan-hom, a kind of tree in Laotian, could bring heavy rain and wind to western Japan as early as Friday and to eastern Japan, including Tokyo, over the weekend, officials said.
The agency urged residents to prepare early for high waves and possible flooding from the storm."
Typhoon,"The second powerful typhoon to slam Japan in a week unleashed fierce winds and rain on southern islands on Sunday, blowing off rooftops and leaving homes without power as it edged northward into an area vulnerable to flooding and mudslides
Weather officials warned that the rainfall from what could be a record storm would be fierce. Warnings were issued days in advance for people to be ready to take shelter and stock up on food and water.
Several rivers on the main southwestern island of Kyushu were at risk of overflowing, officials said. Public broadcaster NHK TV said evacuation warnings were issued for more than 50,000 people in Okinawa and Kyushu, including Kagoshima and and Nagasaki prefectures.
News footage showed people in Kyushu starting to gather at gymnasiums, before winds gather momentum in the evening. Social distancing will be in place to guard against the coronavirus pandemic, officials said.
The Japan Meteorological Agency said Typhoon Haishen, which means “sea god” in Chinese, was packing sustained winds of up to 162 kilometers (100 miles) per hour after battering Okinawa and the southern Kyushu island of Amami Oshima early Sunday. Alerts for strong winds, waves, high tides, rainfall and lightning were issued for Amami Oshima alongside evacuation orders.
There were no immediate reports of any injuries in Okinawa, home to more than half of the roughly 50,000 U.S. troops based in Japan under a bilateral treaty.
Haishen was not only powerful — equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane — but also large in its reach, according to the meteorological agency.
Bullet trains were temporarily halting services, and dozens of flights were canceled. All Nippon Airways said such cancellations will continue Monday and possibly on Tuesday for flights in southern Japan, such as Yamaguchi, Kochi and Fukuoka.
Haishen’s projected course has it hitting the Korean Peninsula later in the week.
Haishen’s course is similar to Typhoon Maysak, which lashed southern Japan last week, injuring dozens of people and cutting power to thousands of homes.
A cargo ship carrying 43 crew members and 5,800 cows from New Zealand capsized off the coast of Japan. Two people were rescued, and one body was recovered. The search has been halted because of Haishen."
Typhoon,"Heavy rains and high winds were hitting China’s eastern coastal region Tuesday from a tropical storm weakening as it neared Shanghai.
Hagiput was a typhoon with winds blowing up to 137 kilometers (85 miles) per hour at its center when it made landfall in Zhejiang province in the early morning. At noon, the tropical storm had winds of up to 108 kph (67 mph) and was moving north at around 25 kph (16 mph), China’s National Meteorological Center said.
No major destruction or injuries have been reported. State broadcaster CCTV showed trees toppled in the Zhejiang city of Yuhuan and the fire service said a panel truck had been blown on its side by high winds early Tuesday and its driver rescued.
As of Tuesday evening, the storm center was located near the city of Shaoxing, about 160 kilometers (100 miles) south of Shanghai, according to the meteorological center’s website. Shanghai was hot and windy in the evening with sporadic showers.
Forecaster Zhang Ling told state broadcaster CCTV that the storm was continuing to weaken as it moved.
“The effects will be felt (in China) through Wednesday,” Zhang said. However, rainfall will have peaked by the end of Tuesday, she said.
China had ordered evacuations of vulnerable coastal areas in Zhejiang and Fujian provinces to the south, recalled fishing boats and suspended ferry service and some trains.
In the major Zhejiang manufacturing center of Wenzhou, south of Shanghai, authorities reported evacuating 200,000 people to shelters and recalling more than 6,000 fishing boats to port. Waves along the coast were reported at heights of 4.2 meters (14 feet).
This year’s typhoon season has been relatively mild in China, although flooding since June along its major river systems has caused scores of deaths, forced around 2 million people to be evacuated and caused more than 49 billion yuan (7 billion) in damage."
Typhoon,"China issued its top warning for coastal areas of Zhejiang province Friday ahead of a strong typhoon carrying heavy rain and winds and expected to send an intense storm surge up the mighty Yangzte River.
Heavy rain was expected in Zhejiang, Shanghai and nearby provinces on Friday before Typhoon Lekima hits land on Saturday morning, then weakens as it moves north.
Parts of northern Taiwan closed offices and suspended classes at schools on Friday as the storm passed northeast of the island. The same area was hit by a magnitude 6.0 earthquake Thursday that caused minor damage but no deaths or injuries.
The red alert China issued is the most serious in its four-tired alert system, prompting authorities to prepare evacuations, suspend train and air travel and require vessels to return to port. In Zhejiang, ferry service had been cancelled and more than 200 tourists evacuated from popular Beiji island.
The National Meteorological Center said Lekima was gusting at 209 kph (130 mph) and traveling northwesterly at 13 kph (8 mph). Taiwan’s Central Weather Bureau put its sustained winds at 173 kph (108 mph) and said the bands of wind and rains around the storm’s eye were shrinking.
The State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters warned authorities overseeing seven provinces including Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangsu and Shanghai Municipality to make preparations and have emergency response systems ready to be deployed. In Zhejiang, nearly 5,000 fishing boats had been recalled to port, authorities reported.
An intense storm surge was expected to raise waters in the estuary of the Yangzte River, China’s mightiest, beginning Friday. Three main streams of the Yangzte River are likely to exceed alert levels and the commission overseeing the river for the Ministry of Water Resources has ordered efforts to prevent floods and oversaturation of levees along the river’s banks."
Typhoon,"A powerful typhoon was ripping through Japan on Sunday and authorities were warning people to brace for heavy winds and rain in areas that include those devastated by a previous storm.
Many flights were canceled at major airports throughout Japan, including Tokyo’s Narita and Haneda, as Typhoon Trami approached. The storm destroyed power lines on the southwestern islands of Okinawa on Saturday.
In its projected course are regions hit earlier this month by Typhoon Jebi, which caused landslides, floods and shuttered a major airport. The strongest typhoon to hit Japan in 25 years, Jebi caused 11 deaths in and around Osaka.
Trami was expected to hit Tokyo late Sunday, and slam northern Japan on Monday.
In July, heavy rain in western Japan killed 221 people, setting off landslides and flooding."
Typhoon,"Eight months after Hurricane Laura devastated southwest Louisiana, the state transportation department has finished removing storm debris from state roadways.
The Department of Transportation and Development said it wrapped up removal of 1.4 million cubic yards of debris Tuesday in Calcasieu Parish, one of the hardest hit areas from Laura in August and the follow-up blow of Hurricane Delta in October.
The cleanup of debris from the 2020 storms on state roadways in other parishes already had been completed.
The transportation department said contractors statewide removed 3.3 million cubic yards of hurricane debris. Two-thirds of that was cleaned up in the southwestern Louisiana parishes of Allen, Beauregard, Calcasieu, Cameron and Jefferson Davis."
Typhoon,"Hurricane Delta, which made landfall about 11 miles (about 18 kilometers) from where the devastating Hurricane Laura hit a little more than a month earlier, cost 2.9 billion in the United States and was linked to six deaths in the U.S. and Mexico, according to a report from the National Hurricane Center.
The report released Tuesday details the hurricane’s origins, trajectory and things such as wind speed and storm surge when it made landfall in southwestern Louisiana.
The Center releases similar reports on every named storm that hits during a season. The reports on some of the 2020 season’s most devastating hurricanes - including Laura, Iota and Zeta - have yet to be published.
In the United States, two people died as a direct result of Delta — a 19-year-old woman and a 49-year-old man who both drowned in rip currents near Destin, Florida — and there were two indirect deaths associated with electrocutions and fires. In Mexico, there were two indirect deaths — an electrocution and a fall — linked to the hurricane.
The Center classifies deaths as direct or indirect. Direct deaths are those considered directly tied to the storm such as drowning in storm surge or being in a house that collapses from wind. Someone who dies of a heart attack during a storm or is electrocuted by a downed power line, for example, is considered an indirect death.
The hurricane came ashore as a Category 2 storm with winds of 97 miles per hour (156 miles per hour) and produced a storm surge that got up to nine feet (2.7 meters) in some areas east of where it made landfall near Creole, the report said. While Laura’s earlier damage came through devastating winds, Delta produced huge rain totals in some areas particularly between Lake Charles and Alexandria. Nearly 18 inches of rain fell in LeBleu Settlement northeast of Lake Charles, the report said.
The Center also released a report Tuesday on Hurricane Marco. That storm, which came days before the much more destructive Laura made landfall on August 27, was originally thought to have made landfall at the mouth of the Mississippi River on Aug. 24 based on satellite imagery. But in the report, the Center said further research suggests it stayed just south and did not actually make landfall. There were no reports of casualties linked to the storm and only minor damage.
The 2020 Atlantic hurricane season set multiple records while producing a record 30 named storms. There were so many that the list of 21 conventional names was exhausted and the Greek alphabet was used for only the second time. The season also saw the second-highest number of hurricanes on record after 13 of the storms reached hurricane status."
Typhoon,"The devastation caused by Hurricane Iota became clearer Wednesday as images emerged showing piles of wind-tossed lumber that used to be homes and concrete walls that were pounded into pieces by the second Category 4 storm to blast Nicaragua’s Caribbean coast in two weeks.
Nicaragua Vice President and first lady Rosario Murillo on Wednesday raised the nation’s death toll to 16. The victims were spread across the country, swept away by swollen rivers or buried in landslides.
Rescuers searched at the site of a landslide in northern Nicaragua, where the local government confirmed four deaths and neighbors spoke of at least 16. A short video from the nation’s emergency management agency showed a massive bowl-shaped mountainside shrouded in clouds that collapsed. Police blocked media access to the site on the Macizo de Pe?as Blancas, a mountain in Matagalpa province, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) north of Managua.
There were seven confirmed dead at the mountain, and the search continued, Murillo said.
Miguel Rodríguez, who works on a ranch next to the site, said he saw at least seven bodies.
“The landslide came with all the dirt, and it became like a river going down. It took all of the little houses that were there. There were five homes, five families,” Rodríguez said.
One home was spared on the other side of the slide. But it was in a precarious position, and rescuers were trying to reach it, he said."
Typhoon,"An ominous tweet appeared on a historic North Carolina community’s Twitter feed about 2 a.m. Friday.
It came as rivers swelled, tides crested and the rain wouldn’t stop. And that’s when people found themselves trapped in their homes as the water rose.
“WE ARE COMING TO GET YOU,” the tweet said. “You may need to move up to the second story, or to your attic, but WE ARE COMING TO GET YOU.”
More than 360 people had been rescued by midafternoon Friday, hours after then-Hurricane Florence swept through, but another 140 were still waiting for help, city spokeswoman Colleen Roberts told The Associated Press.
Crews from the city and the Federal Emergency Management Agency were working with citizen volunteers to get people to dry ground, Roberts said. There had been no reports of injuries or fatalities, though most of the city was without power and thousands of buildings had been damaged, she said.
Sixty-seven-year-old Sadie Marie Holt was among those rescued Friday.
Holt, who has diabetes and clogged arteries, said she stayed for doctor’s appointments that were canceled at the last minute. She tried to row out of her neighborhood Thursday night with a boat that was in her yard after her home began to flood, but had to retreat because of the poor conditions."
Typhoon,"Powerful Hurricane Iota made landfall on Nicaragua’s Caribbean coast late Monday, threatening catastrophic damage to the same part of Central America already battered by equally strong Hurricane Eta less than two weeks ago.
Iota had intensified into an extremely dangerous Category 5 storm early in the day, but the U.S. National Hurricane Center said it weakened slightly to Category 4, with maximum sustained winds of 155 mph (250 kph). Its center made landfall about 30 miles (45 kilometers) south of the Nicaraguan city of Puerto Cabezas, also known as Bilwi.
Iota already had been hitting the Caribbean coasts of Nicaragua and Honduras with torrential rains and strong winds.
Iota came ashore just 15 miles (25 kilometers) south of where Hurricane Eta made landfall Nov. 3, also as a Category 4 storm. Eta’s torrential rains saturated the soil in the region, leaving it prone to new landslides and floods, and that the storm surge could reach 15 to 20 feet (4.5 to 6 meters) above normal tides.
In Bilwi, business owner Adán Artola Schultz braced himself in the doorway of his house as strong gusts of wind and rain drover water in torrents down the street. He watched in amazement as wind ripped away the metal roof structure from a substantial two-story home and blew it away like paper.
“It is like bullets,” he said of the sound of metal structures banging and buckling in the wind. “This is double destruction,” he said, referring to the damages wrought by Eta just 12 days earlier.
“This is coming in with fury,” said Artola Schultz.
Storm surge was on the mind of Yasmina Wriedt in Bilwi’s seaside El Muelle neighborhood.
“The situation doesn’t look good at all,” Wriedt said earlier in the day. “We woke up without electricity, with rain and the surf is getting really high.”"
Typhoon,"Hurricane Eta erupted quickly into a potentially catastrophic major hurricane Monday as it headed for Central America, where forecasters warned of massive flooding and landslides across a vulnerable region.
Eta was a Category 4 storm with maximum sustained winds of 240 kph late Monday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. It was centred about 45 miles (75 kilometres) east of Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua, and moving west-southwest at 7 mph (11 kph).
The centre said Eta was likely to strengthen further and could reach Category 5 before running ashore by early Tuesday in Nicaragua, where it could bring rains measured in feet rather than inches."
Typhoon,"Storm-weary Louisiana is once again under a hurricane warning, with Zeta leaving Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula on a path that could hit New Orleans Wednesday night.
Zeta, the 27th named storm in a very busy Atlantic season, made landfall just north of the ancient Mayan city of Tulum with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph (130 kph). It weakened to a tropical storm as it crossed over land, but it was expected to regain its strength over the Gulf of Mexico.
Zeta’s top winds were 70 mph (110 kmh) early Tuesday, centered about 560 miles (905 kmh) south of the mouth of the Mississippi River. If Zeta makes landfall in Louisiana, it will be the fifth named storm to hit the state this year, joining Cristobal, Laura, Marco and Delta."
Typhoon,"Cyclonic storm Tauktae intensified overnight into a ""very severe cyclonic storm"", the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) said. 100 rescue teams have been deployed in Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Goa.
Cyclone Tauktae is ""very likely to intensify further"" during the next 12 hours, the weather office said, adding it may cross Gujarat coast between Porbandar and Mahuva in Bhavnagar district on Tuesday morning.

Typhoon,"Severe flood warnings remain in force across parts of northern England after heavy rain from Storm Cristoph caused rivers to burst their banks and forced the evacuation of dozens of care home residents.
Environment Secretary George Eustice chaired a Cobra meeting on Thursday in response to the flooding and warned that more could be on the way next week.
Around 40 residents were assisted out of the Weaver Court care home in Northwich, Cheshire, by fire crews with dinghies on Thursday afternoon, as most of the town centre lay under water.
Earlier, Cheshire Fire and Rescue said it was in the process of rescuing 21 people by boat from Lea Court nursing home in Warrington.
Residents were also evacuated overnight in the Didsbury and Northenden areas of Greater Manchester, and Superintendent Julie Westgate, from Cheshire Constabulary, said a number of people had been evacuated in Warrington, Northwich, Chester, Ellesmere Port and Tattenhall.
 total of 167 flood warnings were in place across parts of Wales, the Midlands and the north of England.
One woman said she “watched the water coming through the back door” of her house in Lymm, Cheshire in the early hours of Thursday.
Gabrielle Burns-Smith said: “By 3pm yesterday the water outside was shin-deep and by 4pm it was knee-deep, and we were seriously worrying that the house was going to be breached. Then it was.”"
Typhoon,"Cyclonic storm Tauktae has intensified and may hit the Gujarat coast by Tuesday, the weather office said on Saturday. Gujarat and Diu coasts are under a cyclone watch. This is the first cyclonic storm this year as India fights a deadly second wave of Covid, which has led to a frightening surge in the country's caseload over the last two months.
The cyclone could also bring ""very heavy to extremely heavy rainfall"" triggering flash floods and landslides over the coastal districts of Kerala, Karnataka and Goa till Sunday. Mumbai can expect showers from Sunday afternoon, officials said.
""Cyclone Tauktae is very likely to intensify further into a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm during next 12 hours and intensify further. It is very likely to move north-northwestwards and reach Gujarat coast in the morning of 18th and cross Gujarat coast between Porbandar and Naliya around 18th May Afternoon / evening,"" the IMD said in its latest update.
More than 50 teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) are on duty in five states - Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Maharashtra. 
The Western Railway said it has cancelled 56 trains either originating or terminating in Gujarat''s Saurashtra region as a precaution.
In Delhi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi reviewed the preparedness of states, central ministries and agencies tasked with dealing with the situation arising out of cyclone Tauktae and asked them to take every possible measure to ensure that people are safely evacuated.
Heavy rain was reported in Maharashtra's coastal Ratnagiri district on Saturday, said K S Hosalikar, head SID, Climate Research and Services, IMD, Pune.
The IMD has issued an ""orange alert""' which means heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely over entire Konkan and hilly areas of western Maharashtra, mainly Kolhapur and Satara on Sunday and Monday, she said.
Visuals showed rescue teams helping residents in Kerala's Kochi, which was hit by heavy rainfall on Friday.
Red and orange alerts have been sounded in various parts. Low-lying areas of the Islands of Lakshadweep are likely to get flooded.
The cyclone is likely to cause heavy rainfall in the coastal districts of Gujarat - pegged at ""extremely heavy"" in Junagadh and Gir Somnath and ""heavy to very heavy rain"" at a few places in the districts of Saurashtra, Kutch and Diu especially Gir Somnath, Diu, Junagadh, Porbandar, Devbhoomi Dwarka, Amreli, Rajkot, Jamnagar, the the India Meteorological Department has said.
Fishermen have been asked to avoid heading to Arabian Sea till Tuesday, tourism activities have been restricted and necessary precautions have been advised for naval operations in anticipation of rough sea.
The cyclone is likely to cause rain - of varying intensity -in parts of Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan too.
The Indian Air Force said it has kept 16 transport aircraft and 18 helicopters in readiness to deal with the situation that could arise out of cyclone Tauktae.
Indian Navy's ships aircraft, helicopters, diving and disaster relief teams are on standby for ""rendering full support to state administrations as the cyclonic storm approaches western coasts,"" the spokesperson has asserted."
Typhoon,"The tiny Caribbean island of Barbuda has been devastated by Hurricane Irma, the most powerful Atlantic Ocean storm recorded in history.
Around 90% of the nation’s structures and vehicles have been destroyed, killing at least one person, Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne said.
Irma passed over Barbuda early on Wednesday as a Category 5 hurricane.
The storm has left a trail of destruction across the eastern Caribbean, leaving at least eight people dead in total.
“Barbuda is literally rubble. The entire housing stock was damaged. It is just a total devastation,” Mr Browne told local news station ABS.
He said the island was “barely habitable” and the damage caused by the 185mph winds was “unprecedented”.
Around 60% of Barbuda’s 1,600 residents have been left homeless, Mr Browne said.
A two-year-old child was killed as a family tried to escape a damaged home during the storm."
Typhoon,"The most powerful Atlantic Ocean storm in recorded history has left a trail of destruction across the Caribbean, killing at least 14 people and leaving thousands homeless.
Hurricane Irma, initially a Category Five storm, tore past Puerto Rico on Wednesday with winds speeds of 185mph, churning a path through Anguilla, St Barts, St Martin and the British Virgin Islands.
Before-and-after photos from some of the worst-affected areas show the extent of the damage.
Everything on the tiny island of Barbuda, which has a population of around 1,600, was razed to the ground.
“Barbuda is literally rubble. The entire housing stock was damaged. It is just a total devastation,” Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne told local news station ABS.
The hurricane is making its way towards Florida, which is on high alert and has ordered mandatory evacuations.
The Eden Rock Hotel on the Caribbean island of St Barthelemy, otherwise known as St Barts, was devastated by the storm.
The hotel, owned by Pippa Middleton's in-laws, was one of the first resorts built on the island in the 1950s."
Typhoon,"Typhoon Jebi, the strongest storm to hit Japan in 25 years, has flooded one of the country's major airports.
As the cyclone made landfall along the west coast of the country, Kansai International Airport which is built on a manmade island, is just over three miles off the coast of Osaka Prefecture, was struck.
The storm's strong winds caused a tanker weighing over 2,500-tonnes to crash into the bridge connecting the airport to Izumisano City on the mainland.
The bridge suffered heavy damage but the Japanese coast guard have said that none of the vessel’s 11 crew members were injured.
However, one person in Shiga prefecture has been killed following a warehouse collapse, with five more injured.
Japan has issued evacuation advisories to more than one million people and cancelled hundreds of flights.

Typhoon,"A deadly tropical cyclone has destroyed as much as 90 per cent of the Mozambique city of Beira, raising fears for more than 500,000 people.
Cyclone Idai brought devastation to the major coastal city of half a million people on Thursday night with winds of up to 106 mph, before moving to Zimbabwe and Malawi, Red Cross said.
The damage was “massive and horrifying”, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Society (IFRC) said after surveying the worst-hit areas via helicopter.
Images on social media and local television showed billboards and rooftops blown off, trees snapped and electricity cables left fallen in the city’s streets.
President Filipe Nyusi said he believed the storm could be the deadliest to hit the southeast African country, adding that it was “a real disaster of great proportions”.
Appearing on state radio, he described seeing “bodies floating” in the water after two rivers broke their banks and “wiped out entire villages”. He said he expected the death toll, which currently stands at 84, to rise significantly to more than 1,000 deaths.
The United Nations’ humanitarian office said on Friday that electricity and communications in the city had been cut off by the cyclone.
It also warned of devastation outside Beira, in particular of livestock and crops, adding that the damage took place just before the main harvest season, which could exacerbate food insecurity in the region."
Typhoon,"The US Midwest will be hit with blizzards and gale-force winds this week, forecasters have said, as a powerful storm threatens to trigger more flooding in the region.
High spring temperatures are today expected to give way to heavy snow and life-threatening conditions across a swath of the central US.
Patrick Burke, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service (NWS), warned that the storm could cause widespread power outages and road closures.
“This is potentially a life-threatening storm,” he told Reuters. “It’s slow moving. It won’t push farther east until Friday.”
The storm has already sparked flood evacuations in Oregon and caused flooding in Washington state.
Some areas of western Minnesota and southeast South Dakota are likely to experience up to 30 inches snow.
The same region is still recovering from last month’s ‘bomb cyclone’ which brought deadly flooding and blizzards, causing billions of dollars in damage.
The NWS said that the coming storm is likely to exacerbate flooding along the Missouri River in areas where dozens of levees were breached in March.
The storm is expected to weaken and push off into the Great Lakes area and northern Michigan on Friday, bringing more rain and snow, forecasters said."
Typhoon,"Six tourists, including two young children, have been killed in a freak storm in Greece.
Trees and pylons were ripped up, vehicles overturned and a sea of debris strewn everywhere as the storm tore through the northern Halkidiki peninsula on Wednesday night.
A total of seven people were killed and about 140 more were injured, although most of them not seriously, police said.
Two elderly Czech tourists died after high winds overturned their vehicle, while an eight-year-old boy and his mother from Romania were killed when an outdoor restaurant’s lean-to roof collapsed.
A man and a young boy, both Russians, also died when a tree fell near their hotel.
A body found at sea was identified as that of a missing fisherman.
The 62-year-old’s body was located by an air force helicopter 6.8 nautical miles off the coast.
Government spokesman Stelios Petsas said 23 people remained in hospital on Thursday, including one woman who was in a critical condition in intensive care.
A state of emergency was declared in the region, a three-finger peninsula near the northern city of Thessaloniki popular with tourists in the summer."
Typhoon,"Subtropical storm Theta continues to brew in the central Atlantic, but it may be on course to reach the UK. 
We can expect the storm to travel in an east-northeast direction over the next few days, according to a report from the National Hurricane Center. 
It will move between the Azores and the Canary Islands towards Madeira this weekend, bringing a high chance of wet and windy conditions, before potentially hitting England, Wales and southern Ireland early next week.
It is the 29th named storm of the hurricane season, meaning that 2020 has now broken the old record of 28 named storms in 2005. Meteorologists say another could strike in the Caribbean in the coming days.
So far, storm Theta has maximum sustained winds of 50 MPH (85KM/H), but forecasters say it may strengthen slightly in the next 12 to 24 hours.
If Theta continues on its predicted trajectory, it will be felt most strongly across the Bay of Biscay, the La Manche region and throughout England and Wales, bringing with it the possibility of severe winds and heavy rains.
However, there are currently no coastal watches or warnings in effect; it’s still unclear whether the centre of the storm will hit land.
Cyclones within the Atlantic ocean become known as “tropical storms” and receive a name, when their wind speeds exceed 39 MPH. Only if the wind speed exceeds 75 MPH, do they become known as “hurricanes”. 
Tropical storms like Theta are a relatively rare occurrence in Europe, but 2020’s extreme season has seen storms hitting Western parts of Europe with increased frequency and bringing regional flooding, winds and damage.
The damage seen in Europe runs in parallel with the destruction caused this season across the US and countries further south, such as Belize, Bermuda, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Mexico and Guatemala. "
Typhoon,"The turbulent Atlantic hurricane season passed a grim new milestone as Subtropical Storm Theta formed on Monday night.
The arrival of Theta means that 2020 has now broken the record for the number of storms strong enough to be given names in a single season.
Theta is the 29th named storm of the hurricane season, and meteorologists say another could strike the Caribbean in the coming days.
So far, a dozen storms have made landfall in the US this year. Storms have also caused severe damage across Central American and Caribbean countries including Belize, Bermuda, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua and Panama."
Typhoon,"The eastern United States is bracing itself for the first heavy storm of the season, with torrential downpour and snow expected from Tennessee to Michigan on Monday, and rain then drenching neighbouring regions.
The storm is expected to form over the deep south on Sunday, with heavy rain.  
Strong to severe thunderstorms could also develop in the warm, humid air ahead of the storm from the southeast on Sunday to the eastern Mid-Atlantic on Monday.
It will then race across the US on Monday, leaving snow in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia and high elevations in western North Carolina.
The storm will be accompanied by high winds, causing drifting snow."
Typhoon,"Heavy rain and a cyclonic storm are likely at several places in the western parts of India, warned the India Meteorological Department (IMD) in its latest weather forecast on Thursday. The stormy weather is due to a low pressure area over the Arabian Sea. According to the IMD, this is likely to intensify into a cyclonic storm by May 16, and some places in Goa and south Konkan region may see very heavy rainfall. ""A low pressure area has formed over the southeast Arabian Sea and adjoining Lakshadweep area today. It is very likely to become well marked over Lakshadweep area by Friday morning,"" the weather office said. The conditions may result in a depression by Saturday morning and intensify into a cyclonic storm in the next 24 hours. Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani has asked officials of the coastal districts to take necessary safety measures."
Typhoon,"Hurricane season may kick off early, with the potential for the year's first named storm to form off the coast of Florida and the Bahamas.
Tropical (or, potentially, Subtropical) Storm Arthur, as it will be called if conditions develop into a named storm system - has a 70 per cent chance of forming over the next five days, according to the US National Hurricane Center.
In order for a tropical storm to become a hurricane, it has to establish a warm core, which then must intensify into hurricane-force winds.
Hurricane season usually begins on 1 June, but the storm season is starting early this year due in part to the above-average temperatures across the Atlantic ocean. In addition to its early start, meteorologists are predicting this year will have an especially active hurricane season, with most expecting more than six named hurricanes, and some meteorologists predicting more than nine.
The Orlando Sentinel reported that Floridians aren't likely to be overly affected by the storm. Speaking to Jayme King, a meteorologist for local news station Fox 35, the paper reported that Floridians can expect a 40 to 50 per cent chance of rain on Friday near Orlando, with heavier rainfall in the south of the state.
In addition to heavy rain, dangerous surf and tropical-storm force winds - 39-73mph (34 to 63 knots) - are expected."
Typhoon,"The first hurricane to hit the US this season lashed Texas with high winds and heavy rain, despite being downgraded to a tropical storm.
Boats were destroyed, power lines brought down and streets flooded as storm Hanna swept through the south of the Lone Star state as it continues to battle a different crisis – the increasing number of coronavirus cases.
The storm brought sustained winds of 60mph and dropped more than 12 inches of rain, according to the National Hurricane Centre. It made landfall on Padre Island, south of Corpus Christi.
At least three 18-wheeler trucks and several other vehicles were overturned, shutting down a two-mile stretch of US Route 77 in Sarita, close to the Mexican border.
More than 283,000 homes and businesses were without power at one point.
Coastal states have been working to adjust their emergency plans to take account of the coronavirus.
Texas governor Greg Abbott said on Saturday that some people in need of shelter would be given hotel rooms to help maintain social distancing from others.
As the storm swept in he said that the Federal Emergency Management Agency had approved an emergency declaration that will provide federal aid."
Typhoon,"Hundreds of people have been rescued after Hurricane Sally – which has since transformed into a tropical storm – made landfall in Alabama and Florida on Wednesday morning.
The storm arrived as a Category 2 hurricane in Gulf Shores, Alabama, around 4.45am with 105mph winds and rain depths in the feet, not inches, flooding homes and streets – as people were forced to evacuate from the southern coast.
Some areas have already been hit with 24 inches of rain, and a total of 35 inches could come in parts of Florida and Alabama, according to the National Weather Service. Why specific areas were getting hammered with high rains was due, in part, to how slowly the storm was moving. It was traveling at just 7mph up the coastal states.
First responders used boats and high water vehicles in parts of Florida and Alabama to rescue hundreds of trapped residents while Hurricane Sally transformed into a tropical storm, with winds decreasing to 70mph.
The rescues came after some of the areas hit the hardest were not issued mandatory evacuations. Residents were encouraged to voluntarily leave, but some people still stayed behind in their homes.
“At one point we were grabbing things to evacuate because the water was starting to get up to the second level and then by that point it was too late for us to go anywhere,"" Kirsten Colla, who lives in a townhouse on Escambia Bay in Pensacola, Florida, told weather.com."
Typhoon,"Hurricane Sally made landfall near Gulf Shores, Alabama in the early hours of Wednesday morning as a Category 2, bringing a storm surge and more than 2 feet (60cm) of rain.
The northern eyewall brought hurricane-strength winds across the Gulf coast from Pensacola Beach in Florida through to Dauphin Island, Alabama.
Almost 650,000 customers are without power across three states.
The slow speed of the system, moving at just 3mph, and the amount of rain falling, could seriously exacerbate flooding, which is already widespread across the region. A flash flood emergency remains in place until 5.30pm CDT and people are advised to not travel unless fleeing an area subject to flooding.
Pensacola, Florida, currently has between three and four feet of water in its streets and more rainfall is expected. Much of downtown is impassable, and part of the brand-new Three Mile Bridge to the city of Gulf Breeze is now ""missing,"" according to the National Weather Service (NWS) forecast office in Mobile. A barge has reportedly also struck the bridge.
FEMA has pre-positioned more than 1.8 million meals and 1.5 million bottles of water in response to the hurricane. 
It is the eighth named storm to reach landfall on American shores this year, reportedly breaking a 104-year old record last set when seven storms landed in 1916’s storm season.  "
Typhoon,"Delta has been downgraded from a once powerful hurricane to a tropical storm as it moves inland across the U.S. South.
The National Hurricane Center in Miami said Delta came ashore Friday evening in southwest Louisiana as a Category 2 hurricane but quickly weakened and has become a tropical storm as it moves inland.
The storm is moving to the north-northeast on a track across central and north Louisiana that is expected to continue through Saturday morning, forecasters said.
The National Hurricane Center in Miami said Delta came ashore Friday evening in southwest Louisiana as a Category 2 hurricane but quickly weakened and has become a tropical storm as it moves inland.
The storm is moving to the north-northeast on a track across central and north Louisiana that is expected to continue through Saturday morning, forecasters said.
The system is expected to become a tropical depression by later Saturday as it moves across northern Mississippi into the Tennessee Valley.
THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE: AP’s earlier story appears below.
Ripping tarps from already damaged roofs and scattering debris piled by roadsides, Hurricane Delta inflicted a new round of destruction on Louisiana as it struck communities still reeling after Hurricane Laura took a similar path just six weeks earlier.
Delta hit as a Category 2 hurricane, with top winds of 100 mph (155 kph) but rapidly grew weaker. It dwindled within hours to a weak Category 1 storm with 75 mph (120 kph) winds. Still, forecasters warned of danger from storm surge and flash floods across much of southwestern Louisiana and parts of neighboring Texas.
Delta made landfall Friday evening near the coastal town of Creole — a distance of only about 15 miles (24 kilometers) from where Laura struck land in August, killing 27 people in Louisiana. The earlier storm damaged nearly every home and building in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Piles of moldy mattresses, sawed-up trees and other debris still lined the streets.
Mayor Nic Hunter said tarps were flying off homes across the city.
“I’m in a building right now with a tarp on it and just the sound of the tarp flapping on the building sounds like someone pounding with a sledgehammer on top of the building,“ Hunter said as he rode out the storm downtown. ”It’s pretty intense.”
In Lake Charles, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland from where Delta came ashore, water leaked through the ceiling of Ernest Jack's bedroom as he tried to sleep Friday night. Jack said the tarp cover the roof damage caused by Laura hadn’t blown off. His windows were covered to protect against flying debris.
“It’s raining real hard; it’s flooding; the wind is strong,” Jack said Friday night. “I’m OK. I’m not worried about nothing, just praying that everything goes well.”"

The system is expected to become a tropical depression later Saturday as it moves across northern Mississippi into the Tennessee Valley.
Power outages in Louisiana and neighboring Texas neared 600,000 homes and businesses early Saturday, according to the tracking website PowerOutage.us. Almost 40,000 outages were reported in Mississippi."
Typhoon,"Louisiana on Sunday was picking up the pieces after Hurricane Delta swept through, wreaking havoc on a region already devastated by Hurricane Laura six weeks ago.
Two people were confirmed on Sunday to have been killed after Delta made landfall on Friday evening near the coastal town of Creole, with top winds of 100mph. 
Delta on Friday and Saturday moved over Lake Charles, a city where Hurricane Laura damaged nearly every home and building in late August.
Aerial photographs showed the destruction around Creole, with roofs torn from buildings and communities surrounded by floodwater.
John Bel Edwards, the governor of Louisiana, said the storm dumped more than 15 inches of rain on Lake Charles over two days, and more than 10 inches on Baton Rouge.
Edwards said 3,000 Louisiana National Guard soldiers were called up to clear roads and distribute meals and tarps.
An estimated 380,000 people were left without power on Sunday.
Delta rapidly weakened once it moved onto land and slowed to a tropical depression on Saturday. "
Typhoon,"Michele Vincent’s home was largely intact in spite of hurricanes Laura and Delta But tears streamed down her face as she looked at her church’s broken windows and shattered pews.
“It’s hard to come back and see it again and then to know there’s another (hurricane) that’s out there,” Vincent, of Cameron told The Advertiser of Lafayette. “It’s tough.”
She said people leave with every hurricane that batters Louisiana's lightly populated southwest coast.
“Yeah, our house is still there, but do you know how lonely this place is going to be?” she said.
Coastal Cameron Parish had about 9,800 residents when Hurricane Rita hit in 2005. The next census, in 2010, found about 6,800 people in the parish, Louisiana's equivalent of a county elsewhere.
“I don’t know what’ll happen now, with these two storms,” said Scott Trahan, vice president of the parish police jury.
Hurricane Laura made landfall in Cameron on Aug. 27 and Delta came in Friday near Creole, just 13 miles (21 kilometers) to the east, where Trahan lives.
“Everywhere you look it's destruction around here,” he said in a phone interview Monday with The Associated Press. “Leave Cameron Parish and go into Calcasieu it's bad there too. You can run from the water but you can't run from the winds.”
The Army Corps of Engineers said Monday that it is still installing tarps on homes damaged by Hurricane Laura, and will check on and replace if needed those already installed and then hit by Delta in Allen, Beauregard, Calcasieu, Cameron, Jefferson Davis and Vernon parishes. “ALL eligible homeowners within the six affected parishes are eligible to sign-up for a FREE temporary roof ... through Oct. 24,” a news release said.
More than 183,000 homes and businesses remained without power about noon Monday, according to the website PowerOutage.us -- down from what Gov. John Bel Edwards said was 638,000 after Delta’s landfall."
Typhoon,"A tropical storm is gathering strength and is expected to become a hurricane by the time it hits Puerto Rico.
A state of emergency has been declared in the US territory as residents prepare for Dorian to bring the first hurricane of the season.
The National Hurricane Centre said the storm already has sustained winds of up to 50mph and is forecast to strengthen over the next 48 hours.
Officials have also issued tropical storm warnings for Martinique, St Lucia, and St Vincent and the Grenadines.
Barbados was hit by strong winds, rain and thunder and lightning on Monday night as Dorian passed, and residents were urged to remain indoors amid reports of power cuts.
The storm appeared to have caused little damage, however home affairs minister Edmund Hinkson urged residents to remain vigilant, adding: “We are not out of danger yet.”
By Tuesday morning the storm was about 30 miles southeast of St Lucia, blowing sustained winds of up to 50mph.
Officials warned it could become a hurricane by the time it passes the southwest side of Puerto Rico on Wednesday.
Hundreds of people in Puerto Rico have been stocking up on supplies at supermarkets and fuel stations in preparation for the storm."
Typhoon,"Florida governor Ron DeSantis has declared a state of emergency as Hurrican Dorian nears the US mainland.
Puerto Rico's Director of Public Safety Elmer Roman also warned residents to keep their guard up as the hurricane's path veers.
The hurricane will likely hit the Carribean island today, It is expected to strengthen into a category 3 storm by the time it hits Florida."
Typhoon,"Former Hurricane Oscar, which peaked with winds over 100mph when it whipped through the Caribbean earlier this week, will pass near the British Isles on Saturday.
Although the weather system has now been downgraded, the Met Office has still issued a yellow warning for rain across western Scotland.
""Heavy and persistent rain” is expected across Scotland for much of the day, according to the Met Office.
Spray and flooding is expected to make driving much harder and journey times longer, and bus and train services will also be affected.
The first rains brought by the remnants of Hurricane Oscar will hit Northern Ireland on Friday afternoon, before the downpours and winds pick up early on Saturday morning for most of western Scotland and parts of north-western England.
By the end of Saturday the bad weather will have reached Wales and parts of eastern England as well, and BBC weather forecaster Nick Miller has warned that the winds could reach speeds of 60mph.
“Wherever you are, the breeze is picking up, particularly in the west. But it’s nowhere near as cold, but you may still see a touch of frost in eastern England,"" he said.
“The next system is a deep area of low pressure – ex-Hurricane Oscar. It passes us to the northwest but we are close enough to get a windier day across the UK on Saturday and a very wet day in western Scotland.”
The mercury plummeted overnight, with the coldest spots seeing temperatures of -2C early on Friday morning. But the coming storms will see more mild temperatures, Mr Miller said, with temperatures of 8 or 9C on Saturday morning."
Typhoon,"A storm called Potential Tropical Cyclone Six is expected is expected to bring rain and life-threatening flash flooding to the Cabo Verde Islands in the eastern Atlantic. The storm could strengthen into a hurricane by Sunday.
It has already been determined that it will be named Tropical Storm Florence as it gathers pace - becoming the seventh named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season.
The latest advisory for the storm — released at 7am Central time — said that the storm was 190 miles east-southeast of the southernmost point of those islands, and was moving at 12mph.
Compared to the types of major storms that have walloped American shores in the past, the as-of-yet-unnamed storm is relatively weak — clocking in with winds of 35 mph — but the system is expected to strengthen over the next week and may be classified as a hurricane in the coming days.
That said, tropical storm warnings remain in effect for Cabo Verde Islands Santiago, Fogo, and Brava, where residents can expect the potential for heavy rain and gusty winds later on in the day.
Where it goes from there is hard to predict — storms are fickle things and often change direction — but the hurricane centre’s long-range tracker pegs it as moving on a west to northwest path in the coming days. Early next week, the storm is likely to be far from the United States mainland."
Typhoon,"The National Weather Service has issued hurricane watches for Hawaii and Maui counties with Hurricane Lane barreling towards the islands having been upgraded to a Category 4 storm.
Lane has sustained winds of 150 miles per hour as of Tuesday morning local time, the National Weather Service of Honolulu said
“Major Hurricane Lane could bring significant impacts to the Hawaiian Islands late week and into the weekend,” officials said. “All residents in [Hawaii] are urged to stay abreast of the situation.”
Officials said it was too early to report which of the main Hawaiian islands would be directly impacted – though they noted if the hurricane’s centre remained offshore its impacts could still extend well away from the centre. Intense showers and thunderstorms surrounding the hurricane are expected to reach the Big Island late on Tuesday night or Wednesday morning.
Senior Honolulu forecaster Tom Birchard said it’s possible island Oahu and Kaui could be included in a watch.
Officials have also issued tropical storm watches and flash flood watches for islands Kahoolawe, Kauai, Lanai, Maui, Molokai, Niihau, Oahu and the Big Island.
“As Hurricane Lane approaches the islands from the south, deep tropical moisture associated with Lane will spread across the island chain from the east, with increased potential for heavy rainfall,” officials said."
Typhoon,"Another busy hurricane season appears likely, although it won’t be as bad as last year, according to a prediction released Wednesday by AccuWeather, a private weather forecasting service.
The prediction calls for seven to 10 hurricanes. Three to five of these are expected to reach major hurricane strength, which means winds of at least 111 mph.
“Current indications are this will be another above-normal season,” said Dan Kottlowski, AccuWeather’s lead hurricane forecaster. “This can translate into high impacts on the United States.”
The season still is unlikely to be as busy as last year’s record-breaking season, which generated 30 storms, including 13 hurricanes, subjecting the United States to 12 direct hits and exhausting the storm names selected for that year.
But the danger to the U.S. east coast may be higher this year because of the weakening of the Bermuda high, a high-pressure zone that last year stiff-armed many storms into the Gulf of Mexico. This year, the Bermuda high’s rim could be farther northeast, allowing storms to curve north earlier and strike the east coast.
The Accu-Weather forecast cited warm Atlantic temperatures as one factor in the prediction of an active season.
Hurricane season officially starts June 1, although there’s been discussion of shifting the date into May, since the past few years have produced several pre-season storms."
Typhoon,"Hurricane Irma is the strongest Atlantic basin hurricane ever recorded outside the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. It lasted as a hurricane from August 31 until September 11. The storm, which stretched 650 miles from east to west, affected at least nine US states, turning streets into rivers, ripping down power lines, uprooting trees and cutting off coastal communities.
On September 6, Hurricane Irma left a string of small Caribbean islands devastated. The eye of the hurricane passed over Barbuda, damaging about 95% of the buildings on the island.
The hurricane hit southwest Florida on September 10, battering the state's lower half and leaving a trail of tornadoes and storm-surge flooding as its core slowly moved inland.
The massive storm triggered evacuation orders for 5.6 million people before it made two landfalls.
On Monday, Irma was downgraded to a tropical storm as it lumbered through Georgia to parts north.
By Tuesday, Irma had left a trail of deadly devastation throughout the Southeast, flooding major cities including Jacksonville, Florida, and Charleston, South Carolina, and leaving millions without power."
Typhoon," An approaching powerful typhoon has left at least one person dead, another missing and prompted the evacuation of more than 100,000 people as a precaution in the eastern and central Philippines, although the unusual summer storm is not expected to blow into land, officials said Monday.
Typhoon Surigae was about 500 kilometers (310 miles) east of Infanta town in Quezon province on Monday afternoon with sustained winds of 195 kilometers (121 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 240 kph (149 mph). It is forecast to slowly move northwestward and then veer eastward away from the northern Philippines around Thursday.
Vicente Malano, administrator of the government weather agency, said a high pressure area extending from China to Japan was blocking the typhoon from blowing inland.
“We’re lucky it’s not going to make landfall because if it hits land, it’s really going to be super devastating,” said Ariel Rojas from the weather agency.
The typhoon’s 900-kilometer (560-mile) band of rainclouds and strong winds nevertheless flooded at least 22 villages and caused power outages in four provinces. More than 3,200 people and 43 ferries and cargo ships were stranded in seaports after the coast guard suspended sea travel as the typhoon blew nearer, the government disaster-response agency and the coast guard said.
A 79-year-old man died in St. Bernard town in Southern Leyte province after being hit by a falling coconut tree, the Office of Civil Defense said. Another villager in San Jose town in Northern Samar province was missing after he went to a nearby island in a motorboat to secure his farm animals, it said.
More than 29,300 families or 109,000 people were evacuated to emergency shelters as a precaution in five eastern provinces in the Bicol region, it said. Mayors said they have to open more evacuation centers to ensure social distancing during the pandemic.
“It’s really tough, it’s toxic, but we have no choice,” Mayor Ann Gemma Ongjoco of Guinobatan town in Albay province said by telephone. She said even churches were being used to shelter more than 6,100 villagers in her town, including many from communities threatened by mudflows from Mayon, one of the most active volcanoes in the archipelago.
The Philippines is a coronavirus hotspot in Southeast Asia, with health officials reporting 945,745 infections and 16,048 deaths.
About 20 typhoons and storms lash the Philippines each year. It also sits in the so-called Pacific “Ring of Fire,” a seismically sensitive region often hit by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, making the impoverished nation one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries."
wildfires,"Nearly 3 billion animals were affected by Australia's worst wildfire season that burned from last July through March, scientists announced Tuesday — a figure almost three times higher than original estimates.
The report released Tuesday and commissioned by the World Wide Fund for Nature Australia said more than 46 million acres were scorched. An estimate in January said 1.25 billion animals were affected.
""This ranks as one of the worst wildlife disasters in modern history,” Dermot O’Gorman, the organization's chief executive officer, said in a statement. ""It’s hard to think of another event anywhere in the world in living memory that has killed or displaced that many animals.""
Ten researchers from Australian universities and wildlife groups involved in the report have been looking at both the impact of the fires and the possible ways to protect ecosystems in the future.
The affected wildlife includes 143 million mammals, 2.46 billion reptiles, 180 million birds and 51 million frogs.
""It's almost impossible to comprehend how many individuals that actually means,"" Lily van Eeden, a researcher at the University of Sydney and a co-author of the report, told NBC News.
The jump in the estimated animals affected compared to the January report is due to a wider geographic area being studied and new data on wildlife, she said.
Despite the increased scope of the research, Van Eeden cautioned, the estimate is still ""quite conservative.""
Invertebrate species — such as spiders and butterflies — were not included and neither was a range of wildlife that lives in waterways like turtles."
wildfires,"Just before the COVID-19 pandemic, bush fires in Australia destroyed more than 3,000 homes and burnt millions of hectares of vegetation. The crisis exposed the nation’s fire monitoring system as being unfit for purpose. Precise real-time information about the area burnt and the intensity of the fires was not available when it was needed.
Australia does not have a central system for gathering and storing essential information about bush fires. State and territory governments, and even agencies within states, have different approaches. This worked fine when fires were smaller. But those in the 2019–20 season crossed multiple state borders.
The blazes engulfed a huge geographic range and burnt for a duration and intensity that was beyond the experience of communities and fire managers1. Many Australians endured five months of smoke pollution that breached national air-quality standards. Usually, people would experience shorter bouts covering smaller areas2.
The extraordinary scale and intensity of the fires were driven by climate conditions not seen in a century: three years of drought, including three consecutive, anomalously dry winters3. This weather is consistent with predictions that global warming will result in conditions that increase the risk of fire4,5. Studies have linked extreme bush-fire seasons over the past few years to anthropogenic climate change
Debate over the cause of the bush fires became politically charged. Fire scientists and managers had to stem misinformation from politicians and the media suggesting that the fires were not unusual historically and were not linked to climate change. There were even suggestions that the fires were the result of arson, or of inappropriate land management8–10. Staggering environmental consequences were claimed, including greenhouse-gas emissions that were exceeded only by those in China, the United States, India, Russia and Japan, and the loss or displacement of more than one billion native vertebrates."
wildfires,"SYDNEY (BLOOMBERG) - Australia is in the grip of deadly wildfires burning across the country, triggering an emotive debate about the impact of climate change in the world's driest-inhabited continent. The unprecedented scale of the crisis, and images of terrified tourists sheltering on beaches from the inferno, have shocked many Australians.
With summer only just beginning and the nation affected by a prolonged drought, the authorities fear the death toll will continue to mount as more homes and land are destroyed. Here are some key details of the crisis:
How many people have died?
Since the fire season began months ago during the southern hemisphere winter, 23 people have died. With six people missing in Victoria state, the authorities fear the death toll will rise. Among the fatalities are volunteer firefighters, including a young man who died when his 10-tonne truck was flipped over in what officials have described as a ""fire tornado"". Australia's worst wildfires came in 2009 when the Black Saturday blazes left 180 people dead."
wildfires,"Record-breaking temperatures and months of severe drought have fuelled a series of massive bushfires across Australia.
Although recent cooler conditions and rain have brought some respite, more than 50 fires are still burning in the states of New South Wales and Victoria.
Hot and windy conditions are forecast to return to many parts of New South Wales this weekend and authorities in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) have declared a state of emergency as massive bushfires rage south of Canberra.
At least 33 people have been killed - including four firefighters - and more than 11 million hectares (110,000 sq km or 27.2 million acres) of bush, forest and parks across Australia has burned."
wildfires,"Impossibly fast and ferocious blazes burned a staggering 4.1m acres, making for an‘astonishing and horrifying’ year
On a deadly 24-hour march through the Sierra Nevada in September, the flames of what would become the North Complex fire raced through more than 200,000 acres of dense timber, destroyed a historic schoolhouse and overtook a beloved camp for children with cancer.
Also in its path was the remote settlement of Berry Creek, where Daniel Salazar, 27, found himself once again facing an unprecedented, out of control blaze. Less than two years earlier, Salazar had escaped the Camp fire, which killed his grandparents and 83 others in and around the town of Paradise.
In the Sierra Nevada and across California in late summer and early fall this year, firefighters and residents fought a losing battle against impossibly fast and ferocious blazes.
It was the state’s worst wildfire season on record. By the end of it, the flames had killed 31 people, destroyed or damaged more than 10,000 buildings and burned a staggering 4.1m acres. The North Complex fire was responsible for more than 300,000 acres of scorched land, killing 16 people in its wake."
wildfires,"Large wildfires raging throughout California have claimed at least 44 lives statewide, destroyed thousands of structures and prompted hundreds of thousands to evacuate. A fire actively burning in Northern California took at least 42 lives, becoming the deadliest fire on state record.
Large fires have scorched populated areas of California over the past week, including the Camp Fire, north of Sacramento, which incinerated the entire town of Paradise, and the Woolsey Fire, which burns northwest of Los Angeles. Firefighters on Monday also battled the Rocky Peak fire, which sprung up near where the Woolsey fire began and forced the shutdown of the Route 118 freeway. The Camp Fire has become one of California’s most destructive fires in at least a century, according to the Associated Press.
Wildfires are a natural and annual occurrence in California, typically appearing toward the end of the long, dry summers. In four out of five cases, people provide the igniting spark. At the same time, the environment has also become more flammable. As the state grows hotter and increasingly subject to prolonged droughts, and as more people live in high risk areas, the fires simply get bigger, more severe and more costly to put out."
wildfires,"A giant bushfire on the edge of Sydney, which has blanketed the city in smoke causing a spike in respiratory illnesses and the cancellation of outdoor sports, will take weeks to control but will not be extinguished without heavy rains, firefighters said.
Thousands of weary firefighters, who have been battling wildfires for a month, have been fighting nearly 100 blazes in New South Wales state.
The mega fire north of Sydney, Australia‘s largest city, was created on Friday when several fires merged and was now burning across 335,000 hectares.
“We need flooding rain to put these fires out. That’s really what is going to stop it,” said the New South Wales Rural Fire Service. “These will take many weeks to put out.”
Wildfires are common in Australia during the hot summer, which begins in December, but this year the fires started much earlier, blamed on soaring temperatures, dry winds and arson.
A three-year drought has left much of Australia tinder dry.
The fires around Sydney have been pumping such vast amounts of smoke into the air that they appear as significant rain on the radars, the Bureau of Meteorology said on Twitter.
New South Wales Health said late on Friday that some 1,140 people had sought medical assistance for breathing issues or asthma in the past week – a quarter more than in a typical week. NSW Ambulance fielded about a third more calls.
Six people have been killed, nearly 700 houses burnt down and millions of hectares of land razed.
Strong winds fanned flames towards several suburbs in southwest Sydney on Saturday."
wildfires,"In Big Basin State Park south of San Francisco — may be a holdover from the fire 9 months ago
On Monday firefighters suppressed a fire that burned within the perimeter of the CZU Lightning Complex of fires. The blaze was in Big Basin Redwoods State Park south of San Francisco and could be a holdover from the 86,502-acre blaze from August, 2020.
When firefighters hiked into the fire it was less than two acres, but with the assistance of aircraft they stopped the spread after it burned about seven acres.
In January several other holdover fires were found in the footprint of the same fire.
There is a chance that considering the numerous very large fires that spread through California and Oregon last year, and with lower than normal precipitation during the winter, other similar holdover fires will be discovered. In many cases since they are within the burn perimeter, they may not be a serious problem. But if they are in a large unburned island, burning embers lofted into the air could ignite spot fires some distance away, perhaps outside the perimeter where there is an abundance of available fuel.

drought,"California is at the edge of another protracted drought, just a few years after one of the worst dry spells in state history left poor and rural communities without well water, triggered major water restrictions in cities, forced farmers to idle their fields, killed millions of trees, and fueled devastating megafires.
On Thursday, the unofficial end of California’s wet season, officials announced that the accumulation of snow in the Sierra Nevada mountains and the Cascades was about 40% below average levels. The state doesn’t have enough snow and rain banked to replenish its groundwater supplies, feed its rivers and streams or fill depleted reservoirs.
“It’s not just that we’re anticipating a dry year, it’s that this is our second extremely dry year, in a row,” said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California Los Angeles and the Nature Conservancy. California – along with much of the US west – is parched, Swain added, and should brace for water cuts and arid conditions that could trigger more destructive wildfires.
Just four years since the state’s last drought emergency, experts and advocates say the state isn’t ready to cope with what could be months and possibly years of drought to come. Heading into the summer, battles are heating up between cities, farms and environmentalists over how scarce supplies are rationed."
drought,"Major cities across Turkey face running out of water in the next few months, with warnings Istanbul has less than 45 days of water left.
Poor rainfall has led to the country’s most severe drought in a decade and left the megacity of 17 million people with critically low levels of water, according to Turkey’s chamber of chemical engineers. The Ankara mayor, Mansur Yava?, said earlier this month the capital had another 110 days’ worth in dams and reservoirs.
?zmir and Bursa, Turkey’s next two biggest cities, are also struggling, with dams that are about 36% and 24% full respectively, and farmers in wheat-producing areas such as the Konya plain and Edirne province on the border with Greece and Bulgaria are warning of crop failure.
The acute lack of rainfall in the second half of 2020 – approaching 50% year on year for November – led the religious affairs directorate to instruct imams and their congregations to pray for rain last month.
Turkey is a “water stressed” country, with just 1,346 cubic metres of water per capita per year, and has faced several droughts since the 1980s due to a combination of population growth, industrialisation, urban sprawl and climate change.
“Instead of focusing on measures to keep water demand under control, Turkey insists on expanding its water supply through building more dams … Turkey has built hundreds of dams in the last two decades,” said Dr Akgün ?lhan, a water management expert at the Istanbul Policy Center.
“The warning signs have been there for decades but not much has been done in practice.”
Turkey has long prioritised economic growth over environmental concerns and remains the only G20 country apart from the US yet to ratify the 2015 Paris agreement."
drought,"A megadrought worse than any in “known prehistory” may already be underway in the western United States and northern Mexico, researchers have suggested.
After experiencing a wetter-than-average 20th century, the region has been suffering an ever-lengthening string of dry years starting in 2000, and scientists have now warned the worsening climate crisis is partly responsible for pushing the region towards extreme long-term drought.
The study is based on modern weather observations, along with 1,200 years of tree-ring data and dozens of climate models.
“Earlier studies were largely model projections of the future,” said lead author Park Williams, a bioclimatologist at Columbia University‘s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.
“We’re no longer looking at projections, but at where we are now. We now have enough observations of current drought and tree-ring records of past drought to say that we’re on the same trajectory as the worst prehistoric droughts.”
Reliable modern observations date only to about 1900, but tree rings have allowed scientists to infer yearly soil moisture for centuries before humans began influencing the climate.
The study has rung alarm bells, as previous research has linked the catastrophic ancient droughts recorded in tree rings to concurrent upheavals among indigenous medieval-era civilisations in the southwest US.
The new study is the most up-to-date and comprehensive long-term analysis, the researchers have said. It covers an area stretching across nine US states from Oregon and Montana down through California and New Mexico, and part of northern Mexico.
Using rings from thousands of trees, the researchers charted dozens of droughts across the region, starting in 800 AD.
Four stand out as so-called megadroughts, with extreme aridity lasting decades: the late 800s, mid-1100s, the 1200s, and the late 1500s. After 1600, there were other droughts, but none on such a large scale.
The team then compared the ancient megadroughts to soil moisture records calculated from observed weather in the years from 2000 to 2018.
They found the current drought is already outdoing the three earliest ones. The fourth, which spanned 1575 to 1603, may have been the worst of all — but the difference is slight enough to be within the range of uncertainty.
Furthermore, the current drought is affecting wider areas more consistently than any of the earlier ones — this is the “fingerprint” of climate change and associated temperatures, the researchers said.
All of the ancient droughts lasted longer than 19 years — the one that started in the 1200s ran for nearly a century — but all began by following a similar path to what is happening now, they said.
The ancient droughts weren’t driven by manmade climate change, and nature is still playing a strong role today.
A study last year led by Nathan Steiger at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University showed among other things, that unusually cool periodic conditions over the tropical Pacific Ocean (commonly called La Ni?a) during the previous megadroughts pushed storm tracks further north, and starved the region of precipitation."
drought,"A severe drought is threatening South Africa's wildlife industry, with game farmers keeping fewer animals and tourists visiting game lodges in smaller numbers.
Parts of the country have been affected by consecutive years of abnormally hot weather and below average rainfall that have scorched grazing lands and dried up watering holes since 2015, the driest year on record.
Industry body Wildlife Ranching South Africa (WRSA) estimates the Northern Cape province has lost more than two-thirds of its game over the last three years.
It is conducting a countrywide survey to determine the scale of animal losses and the financial impact on the country's more than 9,000 wildlife ranches.
“It's been an extraordinary drought,” said WRSA chief Adri Kitshoff-Botha. “It's not a one-year or two-year drought. In some areas we've seen it has been going now for six years.”
The wildlife industry generates revenue for South Africa through tourism, hunting, breeding and meat production.
Trophy hunting alone generated 2bn rand (￡106m) in 2016, according to research carried out for the environment ministry.
Southern Africa's temperatures are rising at twice the global average rate, according to the International Panel on Climate Change, and in much of South Africa the level of water in reservoirs is dwindling.
For Burger Schoeman, manager at Northern Cape game farm Thuru Lodge, the withered vegetation and parched ground are a serious concern for the sector.
Once home to around 4,500 wild animals – including 35 different species, from antelope to rhino – the lodge has lost around 1,000 animals due to drought. Carcasses are piling up in abandoned mines on the edge of the property.
“At this stage we are quite stretched. All the money you get from selling the animals, meat and all of that, gets put straight back into the property to look after the rest of the animals,” Mr Schoeman said."
drought,"At least 200 elephants have died in Zimbabwe’s largest national park amid a severe drought.
Since October, the giant creatures have been found in Hwange National Park, although other parks have also been affected by the drought.?
Other species including giraffes, buffalos and impalas are also dying and the situation will only improve once rain returns, said Tinashe Farawo, a spokesperson for Zimbabwe National Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (Zimparks).
“Almost every animal is being affected,” he said. “Of course, elephants are easily noticed during patrols or game drives, but some bird species are seriously affected because they can only breed in certain tree heights and those trees are being knocked down by elephants.”
Many animals are straying from Zimbabwe’s parks into nearby communities in search of food and water.
Zimparks said 33 people have died from conflict with animals this year.
The drought has also taken its toll on crops, leaving more than half of the population in need of food aid.
The agency said it plans to move 600 elephants, two prides of lions and other animals from the Save Valley Conservancy in the south east of the country to less congested parks.
A pack of wild dogs, 50 buffalos, 40 giraffes and 2,000 impalas will also be relocated, Mr Farawo said."
drought,"“I once rescued a friend from drowning when he was swept away by the force of the current as we were swimming in the Diyala river,” says Qasim Sabti, a painter and gallery owner in Baghdad.
“That was 50 years ago,” he recalls. “I went back there recently and the water in the Diyala is so shallow today that a man could walk across it with his dog.”
The rivers of Iraq, above all the Tigris and Euphrates, are drying up. The country is becoming more arid, and desertification is eating into the limited amount of agricultural land.
Dams built upriver in Turkey, Syria and Iran since the 1970s have reduced the flow of water that reaches Iraq by as much as half and the situation is about to get worse.
“On 1 July, Turkey will start filling the Ilisu dam on the Tigris and this will cause another decline in the inflows to our country of about 50 per cent,” Hassan Janabi, minister of water resources, told The Independent.
He says that Iraq used to get 30 billion cubic metres of water a year from the Euphrates, but now “we are happy if we get 16 billion cubic metres”.
As Iraq begins to recover from 40 years of wars and emergences, its existence is being threatened by the rapidly falling water levels in the two great rivers on which its people depend.
It was on their banks that the first cities were established cities 8,000 years ago and where the flood stories of Gilgamesh and the Bible were first told.
Such floods are now a thing of the past – the last was in 1988 – and each year the amount of water taken by Iraq’s neighbours has been rising."
drought,"Hundreds of millions of people could be left without access to water as climate breakdown causes Asia’s vast glaciers to shrink, researchers have found.
When the rains fail, glaciers in the high-mountain regions around the Himalayas are a life-saver, releasing 36 cubic kilometres of water – the equivalent of 14 million Olympic swimming pools – to drought-prone areas every summer.
Glacial loss in the region has been going on for a few decades. However, the rate has increased – between 2000 and 2016, glaciers were shrinking 1.6 times faster than the period between 1951 to 2007.
“A lot of the climate projections suggest the melt will continue to accelerate,” lead researcher Dr Hamish Pritchard, a glaciologist from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), told The Independent.
Using climate projections, Dr Pritchard believes the glacier melt will start to slow in around 2050.
He added: “As we start to get drought stress hitting, there will be crop failures and a loss of livestock. It could cause people to migrate and if you can’t migrate, it might cause conflict as people will need to fight with their neighbours for food.”
This will hit areas such as the fertile Indus Valley, which has been inhabited by human civilisations for many thousands of years and today feeds 237 million people.
The increase in glacier melt is also causing a glut of water to come down, causing an increase in water consumption."
drought,"As parts of the Western US emerge from one of the driest winter seasons on record, the expectation of yet another summer of wildfires will be familiar to many.
Scientists, in fact, are already issuing warnings of an increased risk of wildfires in places such as California for 2021, and other parts of the Western US, as the San Francisco Chronicle recently reported.
The region, where wildfires are increasingly common, is ripe for wildfires following a winter with extremely dry conditions – and reportedly the third worst ever seen.
And it could for a single reason – what is being described by scientists as the second worst drought for 1,200 years.
The Western US, a region at the front of the world’s fight against a warming climate, is on the verge of a “mega drought”, according to a report by CBS, following analysis of the US Drought Monitor and warnings from scientists.
And it could for a single reason – what is being described by scientists as the second worst drought for 1,200 years.
The Western US, a region at the front of the world’s fight against a warming climate, is on the verge of a “mega drought”, according to a report by CBS, following analysis of the US Drought Monitor and warnings from scientists.
The period of so-called “mega drought”, of which the consequences are only starting to be seen, is thought to have begun in 2000, with peaks in periods of severe drought – and wildfires.
As shown in figures from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the period was responsible for the two worst droughts to occur, in 2003 and 2013.
Figures for 2020-2021 are more alarming, with the amount of area being in a state of ""exceptional drought"" at 20 per cent – wider than at any point for 20 years.

drought,"Puerto Rico’s governor has declared a state of emergency after a severe drought has left nearly 140,000 people on the island without normal running water amidst the coronavirus pandemic.
More than 26 per cent of the island is experiencing a severe drought and another 60 per cent is under a moderate drought, according to the US Drought Monitor.
From 3 July Puerto Rico's utilities company is strictly rationing nearly 140,000 clients water supply and they will be without water for 24 hours every other day.
The company has urged residents not to stockpile water and to maintain social distancing and wear masks if retrieving water from trucks on the island.
“We're asking people to please use moderation,” said Doriel Pagan, executive director of Puerto Rico's Water and Sewer Authority, adding that she could not say how long the rationing measures will last.
Gov Wanda Vazquez confirmed that 21 of 78 municipalities are affected by the severe drought while another 29 by the moderate drought.
Under the administrative order residents in most areas will be prohibited from excessive use of water such as watering gardens during daylight hours, filling pools, and using a hose or non-recycled water to wash cars.
Those who disregard the order face fines from 250 for residents to 2,500 for industries for a first violation."
drought,"Water companies, government bodies and environmental groups have warned that the extreme weather this summer could lead to a drought in spring next year.
Heatwaves across the country saw hosepipe bans come into force and put pressure on farmers, whose harvests were affected by the dry conditions.
The National Drought Group (NDG), which is made up of various water and environment organisations, gathered on Thursday to discuss how to maintain supplies in the event of a 2019 drought.
Water companies, government bodies and environmental groups have warned that the extreme weather this summer could lead to a drought in spring next year.
Heatwaves across the country saw hosepipe bans come into force and put pressure on farmers, whose harvests were affected by the dry conditions.
The National Drought Group (NDG), which is made up of various water and environment organisations, gathered on Thursday to discuss how to maintain supplies in the event of a 2019 drought.
Sir James Bevan, chief executive of the Environment Agency, chaired the NDG meeting and said that early action and planning would be necessary to avert this situation.
“Ensuring sufficient water for the public, the economy and the environment is one of biggest challenges we face as a country,” he said.
“The Environment Agency will continue to work actively with the water companies and other water users to seek to ensure that.”
Dry conditions over the summer were linked to devastating fires around Oldham and Bolton, and caused disruption to British wildlife including hedgehogs, birds and frogs.
The Environment Agency responded to more than 300 dry-weather related incidents over the past few months, more than three times the usual number for the summer.
Farmers accused the government of taking “little action” after environment secretary Michael Gove pledged to help them recover from the challenging summer conditions.
Recent efforts to save water combined with spells of rain have helped the sector recover, but for some crops and species the full effects of the summer are yet to be seen."
drought,"More people have been displaced by drought in western Afghanistan than those uprooted by conflict, the United Nations has said.
A total of 275,000 people were displaced by drought this year, 52,000 more than the number who fled conflict, with more than two million threatened by the effects of water shortages.
Reports from the UN and aid charities described farmers lacking seeds to sow, following crop failures in some areas, and livestock dying from the lack of anything to eat。
Afghanistan, where nearly 20 million people rely on farming, has suffered a 45 per cent drop in agricultural output this year as drought hit the country, officials at the ministry of agriculture have said.
At least 120,000 people fleeing the drought arrived in the town of Qala-e-Naw, in Badghis province, in the week leading up to 9 September, the UN humanitarian office reported.
A second UN report, which contained data covering August, said more than 100,000 people may have moved to Herat city for the same reason by the end of last month.
The report estimated 2.2 million Afghans would be affected by the drought this year.
In Qala-e-Naw, where there are an estimated 66,500 drought-displaced people, supplies and humanitarian aid are already insufficient to meet the needs of newly arrived families.
The UN cited an assessment by aid charity World Vision International, which said 99 per cent of people in Badghis thought their food situation was worse or a lot worse than a year ago.
Most farmers lost last season’s harvest and nearly all of them lacked seeds for the new planting season, the UN study said, noting reports saying around 40 percent of livestock have been lost in Badghis due to a lack of pasture and fodder."
drought,"From ground level, Australia's drought looks like a featureless brown dustbowl, but from the air it transforms into an artistry of colour and texture as the land cracks under a blazing sun.
Circular dry plough tracks resemble the concentric circles in Aboriginal dot paintings that tell of an ancient mythology, starving cattle queuing for feed look like an abstract painting, and their black shadows stretching across the land a surrealist image.
But for farmer Ash Whitney there is no such beauty, just blood, sweat and tears as he struggles to feed his cattle, cutting the drying branches of Kurrajong trees – a last resort during the worst of droughts.
“I have been here all my life, and this drought is feeling like it will be around a while,” says a despairing Whitney, whose property near the town of Gunnedah is on the Liverpool Plains – a usually fertile area now withered, having received the lowest average rainfall in nearly 30 years.
The worst drought in living memory is sweeping parts of eastern Australia, leaving farmers struggling to cope and asking questions about the future.
Cattle farmer Tom Wollaston, born 70 years ago in the same house he lives in today, is afraid for what this drought will mean for his children, who aim to takeover the 2,300 hectare (5,683 acre) property when Tom “hangs up his boots”.
“I can't seem to be able to do anything else apart from just feed, and keep things going. The drought seems to be one step ahead of me all the time. We'll battle it out, but it puts a strain on everyone,” says Wollaston.
His wife Margo says droughts have a very negative impact, not only on her family but on the whole farming community around the nearby town of Tamworth in northwest New South Wales (NSW) state.
“I find droughts a little bit like cancer – it sort of eats away at you, and it just gets drier and drier and more severe and more severe, and impacting on your life a lot worse. I do try really hard to keep the house and the garden clean and green because that keeps your head in the right space at night time”.
May McKeown, 79, and her son Jimmie live on a property near the northwest NSW town of Walgett and say they are extremely worried about the future, having had almost no rain since 2010.
“My great grandfather settled on this land in 1901, and he never had to remove cattle from the paddocks over there,” she says pointing to the west. “But we have had to remove them all and bring them closer to the homestead so we can more easily feed them.”"
drought,"As parts of Western Turkey battle against recent heavy rain and flooding, the country is facing its most severe drought in a decade.
Istanbul has been warned it has less than 45 days of water left due to poor rainfall in the second half of last year.
""Last year the level of water in dams in Istanbul was twice what it is now, so it wasn't that bad. Now we are in the second year and experiencing rougher droughts,"" Dr Akgün ?lhan, a water management expert, told Euronews.
Ankara's mayor said earlier this month that the capital only had another 110 days’ worth of water left in dams and reservoirs.
Other cities across the country are also struggling with dams and reservoirs below 40 per cent full. Elsewhere farmers in wheat-producing areas fear their crop will fail.
""Since the late 1980s Turkey has faced drought periods,"" says Dr. ?lhan. ""It's every 4-7 years, which is the result of global climate change.""
""However,"" she says, ""what we face now is to a large extent a lack of adaptation or even maladaptation to climate change.""
Whilst it's true that the country receives less precipitation, it also ""makes inefficient use of the water falling on our cities."""
drought,"France experienced its driest July in more than 60 years, prompting the authorities to limit the use of water in more than two-thirds of the territory.
According to Météo France, from July 1 to July 28, average precipitation represented only 28 per cent of normal values ??across the country, making last month the driest July since 1959.
The southwest, Loire Valley and northeast were particularly affected by this significantly prolonged deficit of rains, known as a meteorological drought.
Prefectural decrees limiting the use of water have been issued in 73 of the country's 101 départements with 20 already experiencing crisis situations.
Hard-hit vegetation
As a consequence of this lack of rain, the country's soil is drier than usual, which is impairing the proper development of vegetation.
This agricultural drought ""must be watched"" in the northeastern region Grand Est, as well as in Auvergne-Rh?ne-Alpes, in Hauts-de-France and Lower Normandy, notes the country's meteorological agency.
This situation (drought, high temperature) also favours the development of wildfires.
Dry riverbeds
The largest French river, the Loire, is currently experiencing a sharp drop in its flow. The prefecture of the department of Maine-et-Loire, for example, has put in place many restrictions due to the situation.
Waterways have even completely disappeared in the northeast of the country, like the Doubs which is completely dry with the riverbed transformed into grazing ground for cattle.
This phenomenon had already been observed two years ago when this river had been completely dry for more than six months."
drought,"As more frequent river droughts will stretch the continent’s water resources, people, and economies must find new ways to adapt.
On 1 June 2018, results showed 4.5%. One month later, it was 10.8%; almost four months later, on 20 October, about 35.9% of Europe’s rivers were flowing abnormally low, the lowest since at least 1991. A summer of little to no rain left major water systems without their much needed water; repeated heat waves were also speeding up evaporation, leading to more water loss. This year, drought was already underway in April, in a big part of Central Europe, ranging from moderate to extreme, according to data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) and in many regions the drought has continued throughout June, making 2020 the third year in a row with unexpectedly dry conditions, according to the Copernicus Emergency Management service.
In the future, this might not be such an uncommon event. Halfway through this century, droughts are predicted to become more frequent, threatening a wide range of sectors, from water and energy supply to river transport and agriculture. “The Mediterranean sub-region, already suffering most from water scarcity, is projected to experience the strongest negative effects of climate change on drought conditions,” the Joint Research Center (JRC) Droughts Team told Euronews. “With increasing global warming, streamflow deficits in this region are expected to happen more frequently, become more severe and last longer,” the JRC team said. If global temperatures rise by 3 degrees, the researchers say an additional 11 million people and 4.5 million hectares could be annually exposed to droughts that used to occur only once every 10 years or so. “We see a strong divide within Europe, with more drought in the South and less in the North,” says Dr. Niko Wanders, hydrological extremes researcher at Utrecht University. “We’re observing that extreme droughts are likely to become more severe. This is caused by a combination of higher temperatures and more evaporation that results in bigger water losses,” says Dr. Wanders.
A noticeable factor comes from the fact that rivers are also receiving less water from glaciers, according to experts at the University of Birmingham. Warming in the European Alps in the last three decades, combined with less snowfall has resulted in a little bit under a 54% loss in glacier ice area since 1850; long-term predictions show further drastic reductions.
Rivers affected by drought lose more than water depth. Less rainwater means that river waters cannot dilute pollutants efficiently; this leads to higher concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as of heavy metals and microplastics, according to experts from the MaRIUS research consortium. The organic build up boosts algal production, leading to blooms that could make the water unusable for human use. Hotter river waters also hold less oxygen than cold ones, which harms fish and other aquatic fauna."
drought,"Rivers ravaged by a lengthy drought may not be able to recover, even after the rains return. Seven years after the Millennium drought baked southeastern Australia, a large fraction of the region’s rivers still show no signs of returning to their predrought water flow, researchers report in the May 14 Science.
There’s “an implicit assumption that no matter how big a disturbance is, the water will always come back — it’s just a matter of how long it takes,” says Tim Peterson, a hydrologist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. “I’ve never been satisfied with that.”
The years-long drought in southeastern Australia, which began sometime between 1997 and 2001 and lasted until 2010, offered a natural experiment to test this assumption, he says. “It wasn’t the most severe drought” the region has ever experienced, but it was the longest period of low rainfall in the region since about 1900.
Peterson and colleagues analyzed annual and seasonal streamflow rates in 161 river basins in the region from before, during and after the drought. By 2017, they found, 37 percent of those river basins still weren’t seeing the amount of water flow that they had predrought. Furthermore, of those low-flow rivers, the vast majority — 80 percent — also show no signs that they might recover in the future, the team found."
drought,"Manitoba farmer Chuck Fossay has never seen his fields this dry.
As he scoops up a handful of black top soil, it runs through his fingers like sand. 
""It's just bone dry. And there's nothing there to support the seed and the crop to grow,"" he said.
Farming near Starbuck, Man., about 20 minutes west of Winnipeg, Fossay is trying to get his canola into the ground. 
He's planting a little deeper this year, hoping to find moisture so the seeds can germinate and start growing.
He hopes that with some well-timed rain, he can still salvage a near-average crop but with conditions this dry, he said it's likely compromised before it's even planted.
""Dry is dry and nothing grows without water. That's just a fact of life. You need water to live. And if you don't have enough water, nothing grows,"" Fossay said.
""If we don't get a rain, a nice, general soaking rain probably the next two weeks, we're probably talking a crop failure out here in Manitoba."""
drought,"Over the past two years, drought has severely affected much of Brazil. According to a bulletin from the National Center for Monitoring and Alerts on Natural Disasters (Cemaden), an agency of the Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovations and Communications, rainfall has been below historical averages in the center-west, south and part of the southeast regions of the country, including in the state of S?o Paulo.
The phenomenon became more evident in 2012. “Severe drought started in the northeast and lasted almost seven years,” says Cemaden researcher Adriana Cuartas. “Then, in 2014, water supply was in critical conditions in the Greater S?o Paulo area. Now the focus of concerns turns to the south, where rainfall has been below average for almost two years.”
Scientist Ant?nio Donato Nobre, author of the report “The Future Climate of Amazonia,” is emphatic: “South America is drying up as a result of the combined effects of deforestation and climate change.”
Low precipitation has an immediate impact on agriculture. The next affected are water supply and power generation. Water levels in the reservoirs of several dams have been low, including Itaipu, the world’s second-largest hydroelectric power plant. “The water that comes from the rivers to the reservoir is below the minimum level recorded in 1993. It’s a critical situation,” Cuartas says. “The Itaipu basin is used not only for power generation, but also for water supply.”
Recent rains in the south may bring temporary relief to agriculture, but water conditions take time to return to normal. “Rainfall would have to be at average levels or above for several months for the water system to start recovering and resume expected levels,” Cuartas says.
Agribusiness has been suffering losses as a result of drought, but it also contributes to the changes in the water regime. Deforesting the Amazon to establish cattle ranches, plantations and logging reduces precipitation in Brazil and other Latin American countries. With deforestation increasing, agribusiness and power generation may collapse in Brazil.
The Amazon Forest works as a cooling system. On a single day, a robust tree with its 20-meter (66-foot) canopy pumps around 1,100 liters (290 gallons) of water into the atmosphere. These masses of air carrying vapor from the forest’s transpiration are called “flying rivers.” They take humidity from the Amazon Basin to Brazil’s center-west, southeast and south regions as well as to neighboring countries. With fewer trees in the forest, there is less humidity in the air. And that leads to drought."
drought,"A severe drought in the Czech Republic, which has reached historic levels in its fifth year, is worrying growers as it increasingly hits agriculture.
Scientists say the current series of drought, which began in 2015, is the worst in 500 years.
The temperature spikes have hit hardest in the eastern regions of Moravia and Silesia and the dry spell has forced many farmers to adapt fast. Some have had to cut fruit and wine grape production by 40 per cent.
In Central Bohemia — also hit hard — one grower, Lubo? Hrabánek of Farma Zadní Kopanina, says he has restructured his land to deal with the conditions.
He’s using smaller tracts for growing than the traditional multi-hectare square sectors that date from the communist days.
Hrabánek runs a family farm in the Bohemian Karst area whose main activity is animal production and breeding cattle, pigs and chickens. His four 10-hectare tracts also produce alfalfa, cereals and sometimes corn feed for his animals.
Despite recent rains, which have helped somewhat, Hrabánek has been “strongly impacted by the drought”, he said.
“Long-term care and care of the soil is important. Maybe that's why we focus anxiously on the principle of regular crop rotation.”
Besides using ancestral methods, he said “we try to grow crops that are not very demanding on water. We have not yet had to resort to artificial irrigation”.
The farm’s strategy has allowed it to avoid produce price hikes so far. “Our goal is not to spew production at all costs,” says Hrabánek, adding that his operation tries to tailor production to local needs.
Another farmer in the region — who produces artisanal honey, beets and greens that he markets directly in Prague — says water scarcity has forced him to irrigate year-round.
“We’re one of the only farms in our area still growing vegetables,” he said, noting that pumping from wells gets harder every year. Tensions are growing with neighbouring farms as the water table falls, he added.
Makers of craft beer in the Czech Republic – a product increasingly in demand at home and abroad – say they’ve been watching the prices and availability of hops, the country’s most famous export.
A representative of Chroust craft beer says the company buys Bohemian hops for its prime lagers and has not yet seen prices rising but acknowledges “growers are being hit. It could happen at any time”.
Winter wheat is at risk, say many farmers, but corn, with deeper roots, has fared batter. Meanwhile, other crops are likely to be ploughed under, unless more rain arrives soon.
The drought has also harmed grass and alfalfa production, needed for cattle feed, notes Robert Ku?era of the Agrarian Chamber of Ostrava.
An agency set up to study the drought and provide data, Intersucho.cz, reports that the Moravian-Silesian Region is in “one of the worst situations” with extreme drought at levels not seen for the last 50 years.
Authorities are supplying some towns with water tanks this year as they did in 2019, as other add-on effects include the spread of bark beetles and Moravian winemakers planning for a future shift from white wine production to red grapes, which are less dependent on water.
As for the effects on consumers, it’s clear that grocery prices are up but less certain is what role the drought has played, said Patrik Rozumbersky of market analyst company UniCredit. Rising food prices have more likely been driven by effects of the coronavirus, which held up shipments of produce at the country’s borders. A shortage of agriculture workers, who were blocked from travelling to the country from the east, is also a likely culprit, according to Rozumbersky.
Grocery chains Billa and Albert declined to comment on price changes but Prague consumers did appear to bulk up on packaged goods, which may also have had an effect – though the Czech Republic did not see binge buying at the level witnessed in the UK and US during the COVID-19 lockdowns.
Consumer food price rises were also in line with current inflation reports showing a rate of 7.8 per cent, a rise from last year’s 6.4 per cent rate, according to Rozumbersky.
Czech crop prices, he adds, depend not just on local production levels but on “the quality of harvest in the whole European continent as the price of individual products is formed on the international market”.
At the same time, said Rozumbersky, “I think that the possible effect of drought might become more intensive later in the year as soon as the impact on the harvest is clearer.”
Industry organisations have been cautioning farmers too: the Czech Agricultural Chamber calls groundwater levels “strongly below normal overall,” noting that 71 per cent of wells are at unusually low water depths.
In addition, low water levels have hit key watersheds in the upper Oh?e, Lu?ická Nisa and Smědá river basins, which the chamber calls “strongly below normal.” Also drying up are natural springs, of which 79 per cent are suffering from “with severe or extreme drought”."
drought,"The water crisis along the California-Oregon border went from dire to catastrophic this week as federal regulators shut off irrigation water to farmers from a critical reservoir and said they would not send extra water to dying salmon downstream or to a half-dozen wildlife refuges that harbor millions of migrating birds each year.
In what is shaping up to be the worst water crisis in generations, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation said it will not release water this season into the main canal that feeds the bulk of the massive Klamath Reclamation Project, marking a first for the 114-year-old irrigation system. The agency announced last month that hundreds of irrigators would get dramatically less water than usual, but a worsening drought picture means water will be completely shut off instead.
The entire region is in extreme or exceptional drought, according to federal monitoring reports, and Oregon’s Klamath County is experiencing its driest year in 127 years.
“This year’s drought conditions are bringing unprecedented hardship to the communities of the Klamath Basin,” said Reclamation Deputy Commissioner Camille Calimlim Touton, calling the decision one of “historic consequence.” “Reclamation is dedicated to working with our water users, tribes and partners to get through this difficult year and developing long-term solutions for the basin.”
The canal, a major component of the federally operated Klamath Reclamation Project, funnels Klamath River water from the Upper Klamath Lake just north of the Oregon-California border to more than 130,000 acres (52,600 hectares), where generations of ranchers and farmers have grown hay, alfalfa and potatoes and grazed cattle.
Only one irrigation district within the 200,000-acre (80,940-hectare) project will receive any water from the Klamath River system this growing season, and it will have a severely limited supply, the Klamath Water Users Association said in a statement. Some other farmers rely on water from a different river, and they will also have a limited supply.
“This just couldn’t be worse,” said Klamath Irrigation District president Ty Kliewer. “The impacts to our family farms and these rural communities will be off the scale.”
At the same time, the agency said it would not release any so-called “flushing flows” from the same dam on the Upper Klamath Lake to bolster water levels downstream in the lower Klamath River. The river is key to the survival of coho salmon, which are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. In better water years the pulses of water help keep the river cool and turbulent — conditions that help the fragile species. The fish are central to the diet and culture of the Yurok Tribe, California’s largest federally recognized tribe."
drought,"Ongoing drought in Idaho will drastically shorten this year’s irrigation season for some farmers, officials said.
Farmers in south-central Idaho’s Wood River basin will face some of the biggest shortages, with an estimated 40 to 45 days before water from the Magic Reservoir runs out, according to David Stephenson, manager of Big Wood Canal Co. In a normal season, farmers might get water into late September.
Magic Reservoir, which supplies water to 36,000 acres of farmland, was only about a quarter full this year before dams were released last week, kicking off the season.
The reservoir holds water that flows through Big Wood River from melted snowfall in the mountains. The river is flowing at about 16% of its normal rate this year after record-low winter precipitation levels, Boise State Public Radio reported.
Prior to the winter, a dry summer and fall last year meant groundwater was already depleted as irrigators south of Bellevue pumped out of the aquifer, searching for any leftover moisture.
Carl Pendleton, a farmer who gets all of his water from Magic Reservoir, said the outlook is dismal.
“I sold my cow herd last week, the first time I’ve been out of livestock in my lifetime,” he said. “That’s the decisions we’re making based on this amount of water.”
The Idaho Department of Water Resources this spring could decide to curtail groundwater pumping to the north, which Pendleton said goes unchecked and exacerbates the shortages so that there isn’t enough to go around.
The federal Natural Resources Conservation Service said Lost River, parts of the Snake River and the Oakley and Salmon Falls reservoirs will also feel the effects of the drought."
drought,"It's one of the most overlooked disasters in the world. In Madagascar, 1.5 million people are suffering from a serious food crisis and need emergency assistance. Several dozen people have already died of hunger. An unprecedented drought, which hit the south of the island in recent years and destroyed almost all of the crops, is mostly to blame. As the UN World Food Programme asks for emergency aid of €62.45 million, our correspondent Ga?lle Borgia travelled to Anosy, the region hardest hit by the crisis.
For the past six months in Madagascar, men, women, the elderly and children have been dying of hunger. However, although the World Food Programme (WFP) has requested €62.45 million from donor countries, the Malagasy government remains largely indifferent to the crisis and has refused to declare a state of emergency.
The region of Anosy, in the far south of Madagascar, has been particularly hard hit by the unprecedented drought. It is also one of the most remote and dangerous areas of the island.
The district of Amboasary Atsimo, from where we reported, is often the scene of attacks from ""dahalo"" – rural bandits who carry out raids in villages and kill."
drought,"The mighty Rio Grande is looking less mighty as U.S. forecasters predict spring flows will be less than half of average — or worse — and that signals potential trouble for the already stressed waterway.
One of the longest rivers in North America, the Rio Grande delivers drinking water and irrigation supplies to millions of people from southern Colorado into Texas and Mexico under a decades-old water-sharing agreement. With more dry years than wet ones over the last two decades, how much water ends up flowing downstream has been a point of contention among the states.
As New Mexico and Texas battle over their shares before the U.S. Supreme Court, forecasters with the federal government’s Natural Resources Conservation Service say river and stream flows across New Mexico have dropped noticeably following a somewhat dry March.
The models show drought is expected to keep its hold over the mountains along the New Mexico-Colorado border that feed the Rio Grande, while California, Nevada and other southwestern states aren’t likely to see a reprieve from dry conditions through June."
drought,"A two-decade-long dry spell that has parched much of the western United States is turning into one of the deepest megadroughts in the region in more than 1,200 years, a new study found.
And about half of this historic drought can be blamed on man-made global warming, according to a study in Thursday’s journal Science.
Scientists looked at a nine-state area from Oregon and Wyoming down through California and New Mexico, plus a sliver of southwestern Montana and parts of northern Mexico. They used thousands of tree rings to compare a drought that started in 2000 and is still going — despite a wet 2019 — to four past megadroughts since the year 800.
With soil moisture as the key measurement, they found only one other drought that was as big and was likely slightly bigger. That one started in 1575, just 10 years after St. Augustine, the first European city in the United States, was founded, and that drought ended before the Pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock in 1620.
What’s happening now is “a drought bigger than what modern society has seen,” said study lead author A. Park Williams, a bioclimatologist at Columbia University.
Daniel Swain, a UCLA climate scientist who wasn’t part of the study, called the research important because it provides evidence “that human-caused climate change transformed what might have otherwise been a moderate long-term drought into a severe event comparable to the ‘megadroughts’ of centuries past.”"
drought,"Arizona is getting a jump start on what will be a yearslong process to address a dwindling but key water source in the U.S. West.
Several states and Mexico rely on the Colorado River for drinking water and growing crops. But climate change, drought and demand have taken a toll on the river that no longer can deliver what was promised in the 1920s.
Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, California, Utah, Wyoming and Nevada have been operating under a set of guidelines approved in 2007. Those guidelines and an overlapping drought contingency plan will expire in 2026.
Arizona water officials gathered Thursday to outline a plan for what comes next. Other states in the river basin have had more informal discussions.
“Hold on to your seats because the reconsultation will be technical and complicated, and it will take a long time,” said Ted Cooke, general manager of the Central Arizona Project, who is co-chairing Arizona’s effort.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation is reviewing the effectiveness of the 2007 guidelines that address shortages and surpluses of water, and efforts to conserve water in Lake Mead along the Nevada-Arizona border. A draft is expected in August, and a final report in December.
“It’s prudent water management to review how well something has worked before determining what might replace it,” said Carly Jerla of the Bureau of Reclamation.
When those guidelines went into effect, the river had been in drought conditions for several years. It hasn’t let up. A drought contingency plan approved by the Western states last year was meant as a stop-gap. It requires Arizona, Nevada and Mexico to prop up Lake Mead earlier than under the 2007 guidelines. It also looped in California for water cuts.
A Reclamation audit published last month found that water use in the Colorado River’s lower basin dropped by more than 575,000 acre-feet from 2018 to 2019, a level not seen since 1986. That allowed Lake Mead and Lake Powell — key indicators of the river’s health — to increase by several feet but both remain well below capacity.
As of this week, Mead was 41% full. Powell, along the Arizona-Utah line, was 53% full.
Arizona is looking to build upon the work done on the drought contingency plan. The committee of about three dozen people that worked it helps develop what might replace the existing guidelines, focusing on how to sustain the river while meeting the state’s water needs, officials said."
drought,"One northwestern New Mexico city is trying to curb water use as the region deals with persistent drought.
The Farmington City Council passed a resolution Tuesday enacting a water shortage advisory that calls for residents to cut their use by 10%. The advisory will remain in place until further notice.
Lake Farmington supplies the city with drinking water and is fed by the Animas and San Juan rivers. City officials say low stream flows and the likelihood of continued dryness will prevent the community’s water supplies from being replenished so they’re trying to lower overall demand on the system.
The latest map shows severe to extreme drought centered over the area. All but a tiny sliver in northeastern New Mexico is grappling with some form of drought, making for a worse situation than just three months ago and much worse than the same period last year.
Some parts of the state received much needed rain and snow overnight Tuesday, but forecasters are expecting below normal precipitation later this fall.
The city of Farmington is urging residents to take shorter showers and not let the water run when brushing teeth or shaving. They’re also asking people to limit outdoor watering to certain hours, repair any leaks immediately and refrain from washing vehicles at home."
drought,"Namibia is facing a ""natural disaster"" because of poor rains, President Hage Geingob says.
He has declared a state of emergency - the second in three years - over the situation, mobilising all government agencies to respond to the drought.
The lack of rain has already left 500,000 people - one in five Namibians - without access to enough food, the government says.
The sparsely-populated country has seen a succession of droughts since 2013.
The government had set aside 40m (30m) to buy food and water tanks, and to transport livestock to and from grazing areas.
Prime Minister Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila has appealed for international help.
""We... call on all Namibians and development partners to assist in any way possible, so that we provide to our people who are affected, as well as the livestock,"" she said in the national assembly.
At least 60,000 domestic animals have died in the past six months.
Those affected are facing severe food shortages following the prolonged drought, the prime ministers's office, which is coordinating the response, has said.
President Geingob blamed a poor rainy season, which is usually comes between January and March, for being behind the problem.
Rivers have dried up in the north of the country, and people are depending on food and water relief from the government, journalist Tuyeimo Haidula told the BBC.
Livestock have been worst affected by the drought, she said.
Information and Communication Minister, Stanley Simataa, has asked farmers to reduce livestock to reasonable numbers that they can build when the situation changes, national broadcaster NBC reports.
The vast mineral-rich southern African nation imports around 70% of its food from neighbouring South Africa.
Its expansive arid geography makes it difficult to grow crops for subsistence use."
drought,"California is officially free of drought after more than seven years, drought monitors said Thursday.
The Golden State has experienced some form of drought for 376 consecutive weeks, the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska, tweeted. It’s the first time the state has been free of drought since Dec. 20, 2011.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration tweeted that weather in 2017 helped matters, but moderate drought persisted. Rainfall this winter further alleviated the drought, although 7 percent of the state remains ""abnormally dry.""
""The storms this year have really helped snowpacks, the reservoirs,"" said Jessica Blunden, a climatologist with NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information. Colder temperatures also helped prevent snow from melting off, she said.
This winter — the meteorological winter starts on Dec. 1 and ends at the end of February — has been the wettest in the United States as a whole since records started being kept in 1895, with an average across the nation of 9.01 inches, which is 2.22 inches above the nationwide average, Blunden said.
That precipitation has not just benefited California. ""It’s been a great winter for the West,"" she said.
The U.S. Drought Monitor website, which is an effort by several agencies including NOAA and the national drought mitigation center, says that well-above precipitation in the West helped build snow pack and fill reservoirs, and that normal conditions have returned to the Salton Sea in the southeastern part of the state.
The Los Angeles area experienced cool winter temperatures that brought the fifth-longest streak of 41 consecutive days with a high temperature below 70 degrees since records began in 1877. Rare snowfall was reported in parts of the Los Angeles area in February."
drought,"Farmers along Australia's normally green eastern coast are reeling from the worst drought they have ever seen and face a tough summer if it doesn't rain in the next few months.
The NSW mid-north coast is usually a lush part of the country, with reliable rain and regular flooding.
But the region has been in drought for two years now and farmers say it is starting to bite.
""We normally get 40 inches of rain [a year] and I think we are up to around 8 inches,"" fourth-generation beef farmer Tony Saul told 7.30.
""And that might be all we're going to get for the year.""
He is standing in a dry river bed that stretches for hundreds of metres through his property near Kempsey.
It's usually full of water where his cattle drink.
""This is the longest and the driest it's been since I can remember and I've been here for my whole life,"" Mr Saul said.
""We've had dry periods — you know, it might be dry for three or four months.
""But it's been dry for 12 months here and the big concern is we've just been through our wet period of the calendar year.""
To help make ends meet, all five members of the Saul family have taken on extra jobs outside the farm.
""We've all still got loans to pay and the bank needs their money,"" Mr Saul said.
""So, we've got to have an income coming in.""
He has been doing extra work driving cattle trucks, but he also has to keep the farm ticking over.
Which makes for long days.
""Usually starting around 6 o'clock (in the morning),"" he said.
""I could be not getting home until 1 o'clock in the morning."
drought,"Southern Africa is experiencing one of the worst droughts in years, with more than 40 million people expected to face food insecurity because of livestock and crop losses. Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Zimbabwe have declared it an emergency.
In semi-arid Botswana, the farmers are reeling after the worst drought in a decade wiped out entire harvests and left the land littered with dead livestock.
Two thirds of the crops planted last season failed, while Ngamiland, a rich beef producing region, has recorded nearly 40,000 cattle deaths.
Rancher Casper Matsheka says there was no food or water, so his animals starved to death.
“The goats died, as well as the cattle, as you can see the carcasses all over. We were really affected. If only the government could subsidize the prices of feed and vaccines for the livestock during such times,” he said.
Nor has the drought sparred wildlife.
National parks authorities have resorted to feeding starving hippos while hundreds of elephants have died.
Environmental nongovernment organization, Kalahari Conservation Society’s Neil Fitt says competition for food and water has increased the risk of human-wildlife conflict.
“The livestock are now putting pressure on the wildlife areas, so the wildlife are also getting pressure on their areas, and that is where the conflict zone is,” he said. “Why I am bringing this up? The... interconnected with the drought is this wildlife-human conflict.”
In Botswana, where drought is frequent, President Mokgweetsi Masisi said the government plans to stop calling it an emergency and instead make drought relief part of the national budget.
“Government has taken a decision to develop a Drought Management Strategy, which would classify drought as a permanent feature in our budget plans, rather than an emergency,” he said. “The strategy will be completed before the end of the financial year.”
Acting director of Meteorological Services Radithupa Radithupa says a robust strategy is needed to deal with the recurring droughts.
“We are looking at climate change as an impact now, we are seeing the impact now in terms of heating, the dry spells and the excessive rains. Therefore, we really need to adapt as a nation,” Radithupa said.
Meanwhile, a forecast for rain has raised hopes among farmers and ranchers for recovery and that this season of severe drought won’t be a total loss."
drought,"The severe drought that struck California from 2011 to 2015 had an obvious impact on rivers, forests, and wildlife. Now, a new study shows it also had some surprising effects on the state’s notorious air pollution, adding new wrinkles to the state’s efforts to clear the skies.
Researchers have long known that plants can both help create and cleanse one dangerous air pollutant: ground-level ozone, which causes breathing problems and exacerbates lung damage. Plants can scrub ozone from the air by absorbing the pollutant through their stomata, or pores. But certain plants also emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that react with other atmospheric chemicals to create ozone.
Understanding how drought influences these two processes can be tricky. Dry conditions could cause ozone levels to rise, because plants shrink their stomata to prevent water loss, reducing their ability to remove pollution. But drought might also reduce ozone levels, because the stress could cause plants to produce fewer ozone-forming VOCs.
California’s lengthy drought, and the state’s extensive network of air pollution sensors, gave researchers a rare opportunity to see what happens in the real world. The team, led by atmospheric chemistry Ph.D. candidate Angelique Demetillo and environmental science professor Sally Pusede at the University of Virginia (UVA) in Charlottesville, examined more than a decade’s worth of satellite and sensor data that documented atmospheric conditions over Bakersfield and Fresno, two California cities that suffer from ozone pollution.
The drought’s impact on air quality changed over time, the researchers report this week in Environmental Science & Technology. Plants did remove less ozone, with absorption dropping by about 15% during the most severe years of the drought. But during the early years of the drought, trees and other plants were able to maintain their production of one key ozone-forming VOC, isoprene. The chemical helps plants like oak trees withstand heat stress, and it appears the trees draw on carbon stores to sustain isoprene production. “It’s like a person exercising; when you’ve burned through your recent consumption the body switches over and starts burning fat,” says Manuel Lerdau, an organismal ecologist at UVA and a co-author of the study.
After about 4 years of drought, however, the stress took its toll. In 2013, plant isoprene levels fell dramatically, by 65% in Bakersfield and 54% in Fresno. Overall, that meant up to a 20% dip in ozone pollution. And even after the drought ended, isoprene levels didn’t immediately rebound.
The plant VOC reduction might sound like good news for reducing California’s smog. But the complexity of atmospheric chemistry means droughts could actually complicate clean air efforts. That’s because, currently, regulations mostly focus on controlling nitrogen oxides (NOx) from sources like cars and factories, which react with VOCs to form ozone. When VOC levels are higher, those NOx controls help choke off smog-creating reactions. But reduce the VOCs, and NOx limits go from “being very effective to less effective,” Pusede says.
Such findings offer yet another complication for U.S. states and cities struggling to meet federal clean air standards, especially in drought-prone western states. Regulators have little ability to control VOC emissions from plants, notes Pusede, and “I don’t know if we’d want to even if we could.” But the study could help regulators do a better job of factoring drought into their air pollution models.
The work also “provides a road map for better quantifying these impacts in other places,” says atmospheric scientist Jessica Neu of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, who reviewed the paper. And because much of the needed data can now be collected by satellites, she says it opens the door to investigating “drought impacts on air quality globally.”"
drought,"About 42% of India’s land area is facing drought, with 6% exceptionally dry--four times the spatial extent of drought last year, according to data for the week ending March 26, 2019, from the Drought Early Warning System (DEWS), a real-time drought monitoring platform.
Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Maharashtra, parts of the North-East, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Telangana are the worst hit. These states are home to 500 million people, almost 40% of the country’s population.
While the central government has not declared drought anywhere so far, the state governments of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Odisha and Rajasthan have declared many of their districts as drought-hit.
“Before monsoon, which is still far away, the next two or three months are going to be difficult in many of these regions,” Vimal Mishra, associate professor at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Gandhinagar, and the developer of DEWS, told IndiaSpend.
Failed monsoon rains are the primary reason for the current situation. The North-East monsoon, also known as ‘post-monsoon rainfall’ (October-December) that provides 10-20% of India’s rainfall, was deficient by 44% in 2018 from the long-term normal of 127.2 mm, as per data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD). This compounded the rainfall deficit in the South-West (SW) monsoon (June-September) that provides 80% of India’s rainfall, which fell short by 9.4% in 2018--close to the 10% deficit range when the IMD declares a drought.
India has experienced widespread drought every year since 2015, Mishra said, with the exception of 2017. As the El Nino--the unusual warming of the equatorial Pacific Ocean that makes Indian summers warmer and reduces rainfall--looms over the 2019 SW monsoon, pre-monsoon showers (March-May) this year have also been deficient. India has received 36% less rainfall than the long-term average between March 1 and March 28, 2019, as per IMD data. The southern peninsular region recorded the lowest, a deficit greater than 60%.
Lower rainfall has reduced water levels in reservoirs across the country. The amount of water available in the country’s 91 major reservoirs has gone down 32 percentage points over five months to March 22, 2019. In 31 reservoirs of southern states, water level has gone down by 36 percentage points over five months.
The drought could further worsen farm distress, exacerbate groundwater extraction, increase migration from rural to urban areas, and further inflame water conflicts between states and between farms, cities and industries.
Yet, the latest drought manual issued in 2016 by the central government makes the process of declaring drought long and difficult, experts say, with the result that drought may go officially unannounced. This means relief measures such as drinking water supply, subsidised diesel and electricity for irrigation, increased number of days of insured work under National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) are not taken. And elections may further delay government acknowledgement and action.
This is the first of a six-part series on drought and its impact in five affected regions--Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Rajasthan."
drought,"Residents call this drought-stricken community a “forgotten town.”
The flat, dusty roads to Vosburg are surrounded by withered fields. The streams feeding the community of a few thousand people have gone dry. Signs warn drivers of wandering cattle and sheep but there are none in sight.
The months-long drought is affecting most of southern Africa. The United Nations estimates that more than 11 million people now face crisis levels of food insecurity in places like Zimbabwe and Mozambique, where two cyclones wiped out crops earlier this year.
Among the hardest hit areas is South Africa’s Northern Cape province, where many farmers are struggling to keep their families and animals alive while revenue falls and debt piles up.
Commercial sheep farmer Louis van der Merwe, 64, broke down as he described losing more than 400 sheep and 450 springboks in the past two years because of the worst drought he has seen in 45 years of farming.
Some animals died of hunger. Others were sent prematurely to the slaughterhouse to reduce the number to feed. With tears running down his face, Van der Merwe said he now relies on donations of animal feed so the rest can survive.
“If we didn’t have hope, we would not be here anymore,” he said. “We have to have hope and faith. There are a couple of times when we have felt it is not worth it.”
Two of his fellow farmers have killed themselves due to the stress, Van der Merwe said.
Northern Cape province will need over 28 million in drought relief over the next three months to assist 15,500 affected farms, according to farmers’organization Agri-SA.
So far, South Africa’s government has pledged 2 million.
The World Food Program says southern Africa has received normal rainfall in just one of the past five growing seasons, with small-scale farmers feeling it most.
Some like 55-year-old Gertruida Buffel, have resorted to sharing their own food with their animals.
For two weeks she had fed two tiny lambs a mixture of maize meal and water after their mother starved to death. When The Associated Press arrived at her home, she had just learned that one had died."
drought,"evere to extreme drought is expected to hit countries in the lower Mekong basin from now until January 2020, warns the Mekong River Commission. Thailand and Cambodia would be hardest hit compared to Lao PDR and Viet Nam.    
Preliminary analysis of MRC’s data has shown that the draught is caused by insufficient rainfall during the wet season with a delayed arrival and earlier departure of the monsoon rain and an El Nino event that has created an abnormally high temperature and high evapotranspiration. 
During a normal year, the monsoon rain usually starts in late May and ends in October. But this year, it began almost two weeks late and departed about three weeks earlier. 
“This year’s prolonged dry weather condition can possibly adversely impact agricultural and crop production. The issue of water shortages for consumption could also come into play as the drought persists,” said Dr. Lam Hung Son, the MRC Secretariat’s Head of Regional Flood and Drought Management Center, who led the analysis.  
Using a three-month timeframe, the analysis looked at both the probability and degree of drought and rainfall occurrences compared with historical data called the standardized precipitation index (SPI), and the degree of dryness of the top soil layer known as the combined drought index (CDI) in the four MRC Member States: Lao PDR, Cambodia, Thailand and VietNam.  "
drought,"Drought is a pretty complicated climate extreme to define. Most commonly, it is defined as a precipitation deficit - much less precipitation falls than what is typically expected for a given time period.
But drought can be observed in lots of ways: lack of snowpack, low flows in rivers and streams, dry soils, higher evaporative losses, low lake/reservoir levels, etc. Because the climate varies all the time, it’s a safe assumption to say that all areas experience drought similarly because all areas will see times when precipitation is (or the other water variables) less than average.
But drought is not equally distributed across the U.S. Just as there are climatologically wetter areas and drier areas across the country, the same could be said about the occurrence, frequency, and severity of drought.
So, some might be asking, ""where are the most 'drought-prone' areas?
Drought-Prone States
First, let's look at the states that experience drought most often, according to data from the U.S. Drought Monitor.
The Drought Monitor has been tracking drought conditions across the country since 2000.
Each week, the map is updated with the latest conditions ranging from none, to D0 (which is an “abnormally dry” category), to D1-D4 (which represents increasing severities of drought categories).
How the map is made is a big process that includes analysis of data that encompasses local/regional variability in all the water variables and adds a human component, like impacts."
drought,"A potent combination of record-breaking heat and a lack of rain has led to the rapid development of drought across the southeastern United States and Tennessee and Ohio Valleys during September 2019. Coming off an extremely wet 2018 east of the Rockies, the fast onset of widespread extensive drought has been quite the climate whiplash for millions across the Southeast.  With warmer than average temperatures expected to continue and October being a generally dry month based on climatology, drought conditions are likely to continue and possibly expand and intensify over the next week.
The extent to which drought has overtaken the southeastern United States by the end of September would have been hard to explain to residents of the region just a month prior.  While a few localized areas in Georgia/Alabama were already mired in drought, the broader region extending into the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys was drought free. In fact, the twelve-month period (September 2018-August 2019) coming to an end was record wet. But then, while it continued to be hot, things turned incredibly dry.
The rapid onset and severity of the event qualified it as a “Flash drought.” Generally, droughts are caused by a lack of precipitation over an extended period of time. In contrast, a flash drought is preceded not just by a lack of rain, but also very high temperatures and/or lots of sunny days. Even if the dry period is not especially severe, the latter two can suck moisture from the ground quickly.
For operational purposes, NOAA National Weather Service’s Climate Prediction Center defines a flash drought as an event during which an area experiences degradation by two or more drought categories in a four week period, based on the U.S. Drought Monitor."
drought,"An estimated 45 million people are threatened with hunger by a severe drought strangling wide stretches of southern Africa.
Emergency food deliveries are planned for parts of South Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe and other countries hard hit by a combination of low rainfall and high temperatures.
“We are witnessing millions of already poor people facing extreme food insecurity and exhausting their reserves because of compounding climate shocks that hit already vulnerable communities hardest. They need help urgently,” said Nellie Nyang’wa, southern Africa director for the international aid agency, Oxfam.
“The scale of the drought devastation across southern Africa is staggering.”
Parts of Zimbabwe have had the lowest rainfall since 1981, contributing to making more than 5.5 million at risk of extreme food insecurity, Oxfam said in a report released Thursday.
Zambia’s rich maize-growing area has been hit hard and exports are now banned; 2.3 million people there are food-insecure, according to Oxfam and the Zambia Red Cross. The drought is also worsening food availability in Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, Madagascar and Namibia, Oxfam said.
Southern Africa has received normal rainfall in just one of the past five growing seasons, which particularly hits the small-scale farmers who depend on rain for their crops, the U.N. World Food Program said last week. The U.N. food agencies plan to distribute emergency food aid to 11 million people in the coming months.
Two cataclysmic cyclones hit Mozambique, Zimbabwe and other southern African countries early this year, wiping out crops of maize and other staple crops. Without normal rainfall, subsistence farmers are hard-pressed to recover from the destruction caused by the tropical storms.
“The successive mixture of drought and flooding has been catastrophic for many communities. In most of the affected areas there isn’t enough drinking water, which means that people and animals — both livestock and wildlife — are having to use the same water points,” said Kaitano Chungu, Secretary General of the Zambia Red Cross.
“This is unacceptable as it exposes people to diseases and creates a heightened risk of animal attacks.”
Some families in the worst-affected areas are surviving the food shortage by eating wild fruits and roots, Chungu said.
The drought has also affected the region’s wildlife. At least 105 elephants have died in Zimbabwe as a result of lack of water and vegetation, according to Zimbabwe’s National Parks."
drought,"A historic drought in Chennai, the sixth-largest city in India, is so severe that it’s now visible from space.
The city’s 4.6 million citizens are rationing every drop of water, restaurants are closing early and companies are scaling back their operations as Chennai tries to survive a heat wave with 99 per cent less water than it had at the same time last year. The state government is shipping in water on trucks, but those trucks can’t replace the now dried-up lakes that once fed the city.
Everyone is asking the same question: When will the monsoons start?
Satellite footage released earlier this month shows the city’s four reservoirs, including nearby Lake Puzhal, have severely shrunk since last June. The reservoirs have a capacity of 318.8 billion litres, but they are down to a collective 651 million litres, according to government data reported by the Hindustan Times. The reservoirs have been reduced to 0.2 per cent of their capacity, according to state government data.
The city typically relies on the heavy rainfall of monsoon season to replenish its water supply, which comes from four lakes and groundwater reservoirs in the region. The monsoons usually start in June but they’ve been delayed this year, leaving citizens with little water amid blistering temperatures that exceed 40 C each day.
The problem dates back to last year, when Chennai saw a major shortfall in its monthly rainfall. The city received 80 per cent less rain than average in December alone, according to India’s weather office.
Temperatures in Chennai typically peak in May and June, around the same time that rainfall starts picking up. February, March and April are typically drought season, while the heaviest monsoon rains come in October, November and December.
The city has struggled to meet its water needs for the last few years. A government think tank warned last year that Chennai is one of 21 Indian cities that could run out of groundwater by 2020."
drought,"A recent JRC article warns that the extreme drought conditions that affected central and northern Europe's 2018 spring/summer growing season could become the norm within 25 years, and calls for innovative adaptation measures to deal with extremes.
The 2018 spring and summer months were marked by a unique combination of drought conditions in central and northern Europe, and unusually wet conditions in southern Europe.
For instance, Germany was affected by a 6-month drought which lasted the whole spring and summer, while the spring was particularly wet in the Iberian Peninsula.
Both extremes affected crop yields. The droughts resulted into total reductions in the main crop yields of up to 50%.
This was partially offset by southern Europe's yield gains of up to 34%.
This juxtaposition of opposite climate anomalies  – droughts in the Northern part of Europe and unusually wet condition in the South, sometimes referred to as the ""water seesaw"" – was  a unique phenomenon of the last 500 years.
 Future climate projections, based on high resolution global models, show that southern Europe is less likely to experience such favourably wet conditions for crop growth in the future.
On the other hand, droughts similar to those of 2018 could become common as early as 2043."
drought,"A severe drought is plaguing east China's Anhui Province, leaving crops damaged and drinking water supplies disrupted in some of the hardest-hit regions, local authorities said on Friday.
From Aug. 12 to Oct. 28, the province received an average rainfall of 83.9 milliliters, 60 percent less than the amount in normal years and hitting the second-lowest level since 1961, according to the provincial meteorological department.
A total of 45 cities and counties have been ravaged, with regions in three cities along the Yangtze River suffering from the worst drought in up to 50 years, said the provincial emergency management department.
The drought has affected over 1 million residents and damaged 400,000 hectares of crops, inflicting a direct economic loss of 1.6 billion yuan (227 million U.S. dollars), it said.
The provincial meteorological authority has been using cloud seeding for artificial rain as no precipitation is forecasted in the coming week in most of Anhui.
The provincial water resources department has ordered lower-level authorities to unveil plans to ensure drinking water supply for residents and livestock."
drought,"Alaska’s wettest region is experiencing an extreme drought for the first time in recorded history, climate scientists say.
The southernmost portion of Southeast Alaska, including Ketchikan, Prince of Wales Island, Wrangell and Metlakatla, has been in a drought for the last two years, said Rick Thoman, a climatologist at the Fairbanks-based Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy.
Last week, though, the drought was updated to a D3, or “extreme” drought, the second-highest category the U.S. Drought Monitor measures. It’s the first time those conditions have ever been recorded in Alaska, according to the Drought Monitor.
Meanwhile, areas experiencing lesser “severe” and “moderate” droughts on the Panhandle have expanded, the Drought Monitor said.
Droughts look different in the rainforest climate of Southeast Alaska than elsewhere in the world, though, with the key difference being that the region is still getting quite a lot of precipitation by most standards, Thoman said.
Ketchikan has averaged about 100 inches annually since 2017, and Metlakatla has seen between 80 and 90, climatologists say.
“In the mass amount of the world that would be an immense amount of rain,” Thoman said.
However, that’s still drastically less than what’s normal for the region. Ketchikan normally averages 150 inches of precipitation a year, and Metlakatla 118. This year, Ketchikan has seen about 5 inches less precipitation than it normally does by this time of year, according to data from the National Weather Service."
drought,"The spectre of drought looms over the country almost as a certainty like the annual floods. This year large swathes of almost all central Indian states are reeling under severe water scarcity. Much beyond the news reports, statistics and the weather graphs, the drought is a calamity that unfolds in the anguish of people struggling for water. India Today sent its team of photographers deep into the drought-affected districts of the country to capture the widespread severity of the situation - what they have photographed goes beyond the routine imagery of cracked earth and dried river beds - these are images that show how the drought is lived through.

drought,"On June 5, it drizzled for about ten minutes over most of Marathwada in India’s western state of Maharashtra. That made headlines in the local media, because it was the first time since August 17, 2018, that anyone had seen a drop of rain in this region, the epicentre of the drought that is now afflicting almost half of India.
Two days earlier, Sakharam Landge was ploughing his farm near Umarkheda village in Jalna district. It was 42 degrees Celsius in the shade, a hot wind was blowing away the topsoil his tractor churned up, and he was not sure he would be able to sow any crop this summer. “But what else can I do,” he said. “My grandfather, my father, all the elders in the village said we must plough our farms in the first half of June, so that we can sow our Kharif (summer) crop as soon as the rains arrive on June 15.”
A farmer in his early forties, Landge is perfectly aware that the monsoon rains have not been arriving on June 15 in recent years. Of the 18 summer monsoons this millennium in Marathwada – a region where the overwhelming majority of farmers have no irrigation facilities – ten have caused droughts and one a flood. As the monsoon winds bring rainfall from the Arabian Sea to India’s west coast, Marathwada is also in the rain shadow of the Western Ghats – a mountain chain along the coast – and has always been a low rainfall area.
However, it is also home to the famously productive ‘black cotton soil’ of the Deccan Plateau. In a good rainfall year, cotton and soybean – the two staple crops of the region in recent decades – bring enough money to see an average farming family through for the next couple of years as well. But apart from 2016, no one has any recent memory of a good rainfall year in this region with a population of about 18.7 million people, most of whom are farmers."
drought,"A severe drought has left about 793,333 hectares of crops affected in northern China's Hebei Province, the provincial department of water resources said Friday.
According to the department, 15,700 people have difficulties accessing drinking water, while 3,000 domestic animals are also facing a water shortage.
The province has seen less rainfall since June, with average precipitation standing at 37 mm, about 55 percent lower than the same period in previous years.
To fight the drought, Hebei will carry out drought-resistant projects such as building pools, water cellars and pumping wells. It will also mobilize the public to transport water to guarantee basic living needs of the affected people and livestock and ensure water supply for the industrial and agricultural use in the province."
drought,"More than 44 per cent of India's areas were under various degrees of drought conditions (abnormally dry to exceptionally dry) as of June 10, 2019 — that is nearly 11 percentage point over a year ago, according to the Drought Early Warning System (DEWS).
Within this, ‘severe to exceptionally dry conditions’ prevailed in 17.33 per cent area, according to the real-time drought monitoring platform.
While just 0.65 per cent of area had ‘exceptionally dry’ conditions in June 2018, it has now jumped to 5.87 per cent, stated the latest data.
Further, the delay in southwest monsoons has worsened the drought index, the DEWS reported.
In the June 6 update, real-time platform recorded 43.02 per cent area under ‘abnormally to exceptionally dry’ conditions. However, the latest data showed an increase (44.17 per cent). 
Similarly, percentage of area under ‘extremely dry to exceptional dry’ increased from 10.83 to 11.22 per cent during the same period.
India has witnessed the second-driest pre-monsoon season in the last 65 years. The country received 99 millimeters (mm) rainfall between March and May — with 23 per cent below the normal rainfall during this time of the year —, showed the latest data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD).
The deficit is prevalent across the country with south India having a deficit of 47 per cent, followed by northwest India (30 per cent), central India (18 per cent), and east and northeast (14 per cent).
The month of June, which accounts for 18 per cent of rain, may end up with a deficit of 40 per cent in at least 66 districts across the country, warned Skymet Weather, a private weather forecasting agency.
The low rainfall would be difficult to make up for the deficit in coming months, it noted.
According to the IMD, there is also a possibility of weaker monsoon in July. It could be a great cause of worry, as the month is crucial and receives one third of the total monsoon rains in the country. 
The sluggish pace of the south west monsoon has compounded the severe dry spell. As a result, at least 30 sub-divisions are likely to experience ‘deficient’ and ‘largely deficient’ monsoon season, the IMD said.
Most of these are in Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, and the north eastern states. Only four sub-divisions in Karnataka, Gujarat, and Lakshadweep have witnessed ‘normal’ rainfall.
Low rainfall has also contributed to a downward trend in water levels in at least 71 of 91 reservoirs across India, a recent bulletin by the Central Water Commission (CWC), has showed.
The situation is particularly grim in the north-western region — in Gujarat and Maharashtra — and in the southern states of Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu, it said."
drought,"Chile has been hit by its worst drought in six decades, forcing officials to declare an agricultural emergency to prevent the collapse of farming. 
The country's capital Santiago and its outskirts, as well as Coquimbo, Valparaiso and O'Higgins, are among the worst-hit areas.
The emergency status, impacting almost half the country, will see relief measures fast-tracked for the agriculture industry, including drinking water and medicine for animals.
In some areas, water for human consumption has become scarce.
Cattle are collapsing where they stand and reducing to skeletons in the baking heat, and boats have been left abandoned in dried-out marinas.
""We are talking about a process of desertification rather than a temporary drought or absence of rain problem. We are talking about a tendency that has come to stay,"" Felipe Machado, director of the country's resilience institute.
This year has been one of the driest years Chile has experienced in sixty years, according to agriculture minister Antonio Walker."
drought,"Almost half of India – an area home to more than 500 million people – is facing drought-like conditions while a blistering heatwave has killed dozens of people in the impoverished eastern state of Bihar.
As the country suffers its lowest rainfall ahead of a monsoon season in more than six decades, the western state of Maharashtra witnesses its worst drought in 47 years, forcing many to leave their lands and take shelter in relief camps, as they wait for monsoon rains.
Reporting from Beed in Maharashtra, Al Jazeera’s Elizabeth Puranam said people walk in intense heat, sometimes for kilometres, only to find a small amount of muddy water at the bottom of a well.
Asha Pawar said she collects about five pots – or 100 litres – of water a day for herself and her four children. The state government provides water tankers, but Pawar said they only come every four or five days.
“We have no arrangements for water. We keep getting it from whatever source is available. If nothing is available, we climb down the well for drinking water,” Pawar told Al Jazeera.
“My daughter fell in the well when she went to fetch water. A passer-by rescued her when he heard her scream.”
Elsewhere in Beed, farmers have left their land and moved to nearby relief camps, where the government provides fodder and water to keep their cattle alive.
“There is no water left in the Beed area. It used to rain by June 7, but there are still no signs of rains. Last year, we had a drought situation. This year is worse. If it doesn’t rain again this year, we have to leave our village,” said farmer Navnath Kadam, who has already spent four months at a relief camp."
drought,"The U.S. Drought Monitor recently reported that, for the first time in its nearly 20-year history, none of the contiguous states was showing symptoms of severe or exceptional drought. That report includes Arizona, as this year’s abnormally wet May helped push the state out of a 10-year drought period.
According to the monitor’s weekly report for late last week, only 20.5% of Arizona was showing moderate drought or “abnormally dry” symptoms. Data for the same week in 2018 found 100% of the state in moderate drought or abnormally dry, with a majority of the state experiencing severe (97%) or extreme drought (73.2%).
Richard Heim, a meteorologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Centers for Environmental Information, said the change was tied to this year’s wet spring.
“Rain and snow have been falling in the areas that needed it, so the drought’s contracted a lot,” he said.
Arizona is no stranger to downpours in the monsoon season, which runs June 15 to Sept. 30, according the National Weather Service, but heavy rain and snowfall in spring isn’t typical for the Southwest.
State climatologist Nancy Selover said the increased rain and snow came from winter storms over the Southwest that lingered longer and provided more moisture than in the past."
drought,"The epic drought that began in the state of California in December 2011 and only officially ended in March of this year will have many lasting impacts—but one of the most severe is what it did to the trees in the central and southern Sierra Nevada mountains. A new study in the journal Nature Geosciences reports that by the drought’s peak, a combination of factors—including lack of rain, extreme heat and overcrowding stressed out the forest—lead to mass die-offs. In total, almost 150 million trees have died in California since the drought began.
Nathanael Johnson at Grist reports that to understand the tree-mageddon, researchers analyzed various forest communities in the mountains, including areas where 80 percent of the trees died and other where as few as two percent of the trees were lost."
drought,"Hundreds of Indian villages have been evacuated as a historic drought forces families to abandon their homes in search of water.
The country has seen extremely high temperatures in recent weeks. On Monday the capital, Delhi, saw its highest ever June temperature of 48C. In Rajasthan, the city of Churu recently experienced highs of 50.8C, making it the hottest place on the planet.
Further south, less than 250 miles from the country’s commercial capital, Mumbai, village after village lies deserted. Estimates suggest up to 90% of the area’s population has fled, leaving the sick and elderly to fend for themselves in the face of a water crisis that shows no sign of abating.
The village of Hatkarwadi, about 20 miles from Beed in Maharashtra state, is almost completely deserted.
Wells and handpumps have run dry in the 45C heatwave. The drought, which officials say is worse than the 1972 famine that affected 25 million people across the state, began early in December. By the end of May, Hatkarwadi had been deserted with only 10-15 families remaining out of a population of more than 2,000.
With 80% of districts in neighbouring Karnataka and 72% in Maharashtra hit by drought and crop failure, the 8 million farmers in these two states are struggling to survive. More than 6,000 tankers supply water to villages and hamlets in Maharashtra daily, as conflict brews between the two states over common water resources.
The acute water shortage has devastated villagers’ agriculture-based livelihood. Crops have withered and died, leaving livestock starving and with little to drink. Major crops, including maize, soya, cotton, sweet lime, pulses and groundnuts – drivers of the local economy – have suffered."
drought,"Once the wettest place on Earth, Cherrapunji, a town in northeastern India, has faced a drought each winter for the past few years. Kerala, a state in the southwest, flooded devastatingly in 2018, but saw its wells run dry soon after.
Chennai, a growing south-Indian metropolis, was inundated by rains in 2015—but this summer, waiting for the monsoon, its 11 million residents have watched three of its four reservoirs run dry. Meanwhile, across India, the groundwater that provides an invaluable buffer between monsoons is severely depleted and in danger of being irreversibly lost.
Welcome to the new India: hot and desiccated and wet and flooded, all at once, with the fates of 1.3 billion people and rich biodiversity hotspots riding upon increasingly unpredictable rains.
The southwest monsoon, which usually drenches India from June to September, has come ten days late this year, bringing 30 percent less rain than normal for the month of June. In the north, Delhi has thus far seen almost no rain, while in southern India reservoir levels in southern India are running dangerously low. Headlines in newspapers scream “zero-day” and “running dry” and “historic drought.”
Chennai, a megacity now dependent on tanker trucks, leads the grim news. But Bangalore, India’s answer to Silicon Valley, is not far behind. There are murmurs that this burgeoning, bulging city will have used all its groundwater by 2020.
The dire predicaments of these two urban areas is a cautionary tale—a symptom of the larger malaise that plagues water management in a country that is soon to be the most populous on Earth."
drought,"More than half of India is reeling from drought-like conditions, the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) latest data shows, with millions struggling for drinking water as lakes dry up and groundwater levels deplete amid a sluggish monsoon that, as per the agriculture ministry, has impacted the sowing of key summer crops over the past two weeks.
According to IMD, the monsoon was 39% deficient till June 22 despite marginal improvement over the last week. In its Sunday bulletin, the national weather forecaster said the monsoon advanced into parts of central Maharashtra, Marathwada and Vidarbha, remaining areas of Karnataka, Telangana, Odisha, Jharkhand, Gangetic West Bengal and Bihar, most parts of Chhattisgarh, and some areas of eastern Uttar Pradesh. But the weather system’s poor intensity has stoked a severe water crisis in many states, as half the country, especially states such as Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telengana and Andhra Pradesh, battle a drought-like situation..
Most districts in east, central and peninsular India are facing “extremely dry” conditions, as per the Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) that shows the observed rainfall amount compared with the rainfall climatology at a certain place over a long-term reference period. The index is released by IMD Pune’s Climate Application and User Interface team."
drought,"More than 600 million people dependent on agriculture have been adversely affected by drought conditions across swathes of India.
Soaring temperatures since early June, averaging about 45 degrees, have stifled most of the country, while the progress of the annual monsoon rains, which normally bring relief from the searing heat and are a vital source of water, has been the slowest in 12 years.
An estimated 43 per cent of the country is affected by drought.
According to countrywide news reports, hundreds of villages and small towns in states including Uttar Pradesh in the east, Rajasthan and Maharashtra in the west and Andhra Pradesh in southern India are surrounded by parched farmland and have been deserted.
The country’s meteorological department predicts a deficient monsoon that in all likelihood may not be able to resuscitate some 91 life-sustaining reservoirs across India, where water levels in some cases are hovering at about 30 per cent capacity.
The federal government, however, has played down reports of water shortages. Addressing a press conference in New Delhi on Monday, water resources minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said media reports of the water crisis were exaggerated."
drought,"Some parts of the Horn of Africa have been hit by the worst drought in 60 years, the UN says.
More than 10 million people are thought to be affected across the region.
The UN now classifies large areas of Somalia, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Kenya as a crisis or an emergency.
Charity Save the Children says drought and war in Somalia has led to unprecedented numbers fleeing across the border into Kenya, with about 1,300 people arriving every day.
Three camps at Dadaab, just inside Kenya, are home to well over 350,000 people, but they were built to hold just 90,000 and are severely overcrowded.
A prolonged failure of rains, which began in late 2010, is now taking its toll.
The UN's Office for the Co-Ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) warns that the situation is continuing to deteriorate, and the number of people in need will continue to increase.
The numbers now affected are huge, Ohca says: 3.2m in Ethiopia, 3.2m in Kenya, 2.6m in Somalia and more than 100,000 in Djibouti.
Every month during 2011, about 15,000 Somalis have fled their country, arriving in Kenya and Ethiopia, according to Ocha.
While conflict has been a fact of life for them for years, it is the drought that has brought them to breaking point. Many have walked for days, are exhausted, in poor health, desperate for food and water.
The UN refugee agency is dealing with the exodus.
A new refugee camp primarily for Somalis was opened at Kobe in Ethiopia last Friday, near an existing camp at Melkadida.
More than 3,500 refugees and their belongings were moved there over the weekend.
The UNHCR says this is the sixth camp for Somalis in Ethiopia, which is currently housing some 130,000 displaced people.
Food prices have risen substantially across the region, pushing many moderately poor households over the edge.
The price of grain in affected areas in Kenya is 30-80% above average.
The spokeswoman for Ocha, Elizabeth Byrs, said appeals for Somalia and Kenya, each about 525m (328m), are barely 50% funded, while a 30m appeal for Djibouti has raised just 30% of the needed funds."
drought,"Millions of people in the Horn of Africa are facing severe shortages of food as the worst drought in the region for six decades withers crops and kills livestock, as the BBC's world affairs correspondent Mike Wooldridge reports.
""I had a herd of 200 cows. I took them to Ethiopia when the drought started. All the cows I had taken there died and I came back without a single cow.""
That story told by a resident of Wajir district in northern Kenya might not immediately appear to symbolise the humanitarian emergency increasingly gripping swathes of East Africa and the Horn of Africa - in the way that the rapidly growing number of acutely malnourished children trekking out of Somalia does.
But the distress being experienced by pastoralist communities across the affected region also goes a long way in explaining the severity of the current drought, its impact and the limits to the strategies people use to try to protect their livelihoods in such circumstances.
The Wajir cattle herder acted when he saw the grazing for his precious animals drying up.
But in the area of Ethiopia he took them to there turned out to be no greater chance of saving them. They started dropping dead, he says, one by one.
Aid officials estimate that up to half a million cattle have been lost in Ethiopia this year.
It often takes pastoralists at least two years to recover from a severe drought, particularly where it means building up a milking herd again.
This year's drought has hit hard when many people have not yet recovered from the last serious drought in 2009.
And the more marginalised the communities - and many of them are - the more likely people are to be pushed over the edge."
drought,"Born into a farming family in south Yunnan province, China, Zhu Youyong's life has always been tied to the soil. At the age of 54, however, Zhu — now president of Yunnan Agricultural University in Kunming — says he ""has never seen such severe drought in Yunnan"".
Since last September, the province has had 60% less rainfall than normal. According to the Ministry of Civil Affairs, 8.1 million people — 18% of Yunnan's population — are short of drinking water, and US2.5-billion worth of crops are expected to fail.
Scientists in China say that the crisis marks one of the strongest case studies so far of how climate change and poor environmental practice can combine to create a disaster. They are now scrambling to pin down exactly what caused the drought, and whether similar events are likely to hit the region more often in the future.
Meanwhile, with most of the province's winter crops ruined, local farmers need immediate help. Zhu has been going from county to county to persuade farmers to grow different crops together in the same field, rather than as a monoculture. Intercropping can boost yields by up to 30%, and could help to avoid food shortages in the region later this year1. This summer, 80% of the farmland in Yunnan — a staggering 2.9 million hectares — will use the technique. But success will depend on a break in the weather. ""If it still doesn't rain in late May, the consequences will be unthinkable,"" says Zhu."
drought,"Across northern China swathes of land are dry, parched by drought.
In some areas these are the driest conditions in a lifetime. Snowfalls in recent days have helped a little, but still, across huge areas of land, water is in short supply.
The countryside is dotted with empty dams. Standing on top of one, near Qufu in Shandong Province, you can see just a tiny muddy pool in the centre of a dam that is hundreds of metres long.
Sitting rusting on the earth is a small boat. Along the dry dam floor people have been planting rows of crops because it has been like this for so long.
Li Si Jiao, 77, his back stooped with age, shuffles slowly along a path on top of the dam. His face is weathered and creased with lines. He gestures at the dam and says the water used to stretch all the way to the village in the distance, but no more.
This is China's breadbasket, the heart of its grain growing lands, and all around are Shandong's wheat fields. They are full of lines of seedlings, sprouting from the ground, but wilting and yellowing.
A grey, polluted haze hangs in the air. Every few hundred yards small groups of men and women are working to try to save their crops from the drought.
China is the world's biggest grower and consumer of wheat. In normal years it is self-sufficient. But if it has to import grain this year then that will have an impact far afield.
Already just the warnings of a possible shortfall in China's crop have put pressure on global wheat prices."
drought,"Drought has spread in England, with parts of East and South Yorkshire now officially affected.
The Environment Agency said public water supplies should not be affected, but lower river and groundwater levels meant businesses and farmers taking water from rivers should use it wisely.
The agency has already declared drought in areas of the South East and East Anglia.
Seven water companies in those areas are to impose hosepipe bans on 5 April.
Yorkshire Water said it did not anticipate any restrictions such as hosepipe bans for the time being.
In a statement, the company said it would constantly review the situation ""as the dry weather continues"".
""Our regional water supply system gives us flexibility, what it doesn't give us is an unlimited supply of water, so we would always encourage our customers to only use what they need, when they need it.""
As the warm spell across the UK continued on Tuesday, firefighters were involved in tackling blazes in North Yorkshire, south Wales, Dumfries and Galloway and the Borders.
The grassland fires in Scotland, which had broken out on Monday afternoon, took until Tuesday evening to extinguish.
Owing to clear conditions and its elevated position across a front of 1km-2km, the Dumfries blaze was visible as far away as Workington in Cumbria.
A Royal Navy helicopter from HMS Gannet at Prestwick was used to move firefighters and equipment across the remote hillside.
On Hanging Moor, in Thruscross, it took more than 35 firefighters almost 12 hours to bring a blaze under control, after being called to the scene early on Tuesday afternoon.
In south Wales on Tuesday, a grass fire spread to a house, garage and electricity poles near Pontardawe in the Swansea Valley, while forestry in the Rhondda Fach was also hit by a spreading grass fire.
The Environment Agency has warned that above-average rainfall could be required in coming weeks if drought is not to spread more widely.
Two dry winters have led to concerns that wetlands, ponds and streams could dry out, damaging wildlife including amphibians, aquatic insects and wading birds."
drought,"The number of people facing severe food shortages is set to increase as the impact of drought, along with high food and fuel prices, continues to grip the Horn of Africa region, FAO warned today.
High levels of acute malnutrition are widespread and more than 8 million people in Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia are in need of emergency assistance.
The region has now experienced two consecutive seasons of significantly below-average rainfall, resulting in failed crop production, depletion of grazing resources and significant livestock mortality.
Chronic crisis
""The current crisis is not an unusual or chance event, but rather a chronic feature of the region. The challenge ahead is to empower farmers and pastoralists to adapt to the new realities of high variability of weather patterns and more frequent extreme weather events,"" said Rod Charters, Regional Emergency Coordinator for Eastern and Central Africa.
""Together with our partners of the Regional Food Security and Nutrition Working Group we have been preparing for this drought scenario since the failure of last year's short rains. FAO issued various alerts and has been supporting countries' preparedness plans in the Region.""
In Somalia, malnutrition rates are amongst the worst in the world, with one in four children in southern Somalia acutely malnourished. The drought is affecting most parts of the country, leading to livestock deaths and sky-rocketing food prices which make it increasingly difficult for poor families to feed themselves.
Currently, 2.5 million people – one in three Somalis – are in need of humanitarian assistance but with the ongoing conflict in the South, coupled with the poor outlook for the upcoming harvest, many more Somalis may fall into severe crisis.
In Kenya, more than 2.4 million people in the pastoralist and agropastoralist areas of northern and northeastern regions are estimated to be unable to meet their basic food and water needs. The food security situation is expected to further deteriorate as milk production in the drought-affected areas has collapsed and will not recover until October when the short rains are expected to start.
Furthermore, distances to water have doubled to 30-40 kms in many areas and conflicts have occurred over grazing resources, leading to loss of human lives and livestock, along with constrained market access. Emergency interventions are urgently required to mitigate the impact and protect further livelihood and nutritional deterioration.
In Ethiopia, a La Ni?a episode has resulted in the failure of two consecutive seasons of rain, water shortages, very poor pasture and marked deterioration in livestock conditions resulting in much reduced livestock prices in south and southeastern lowlands. In Borena Zone, on the southern border with Kenya, 220 000 cattle deaths have been reported. 
Additionally, the drought has also affected the 2011 ""belg"" cropping season to be harvested in June/July, which is expected to be very poor in the Oromia, Tigray, Ahmara and SNNP (Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples) regions.
At the beginning of June the number of people requiring assistance in Ethiopia was estimated at 11.4 million.  This includes 3.2 million people in need of emergency assistance and the 8.2 million people registered under the productive safety net programme.
In Djibouti, the ongoing drought coupled with very high staple food prices, high unemployment and increased rural-urban migration has worsened the food security situation at the household level. Water shortages in Djibouti City are also expected to become a serious issue over the coming months as the peak demand for water approaches."
drought,"The United Nations refugee agency said today that with the increasing gravity of the situation in Somalia, where hundreds of thousands of people are suffering because of drought and conflict, it was stepping up assistance with aid distributions across the country’s central and southern parts.
Adrian Edwards, a spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), told a news briefing in Geneva that “although access remains a serious impediment, working with partners on the ground in Somalia we have so far distributed assistance packages to some 90,000 people in Mogadishu and Belet Hawa and Dobley in southwest Somalia.”
The agency is handing out non-food aid for an estimated 126,000 people in other parts of the Gedo and Lower Juba region to the west, with assistance also on its way to Mogadishu and the Afgooye corridor just west of Mogadishu, as well as further southwest in the Lower Shabelle area, Mr. Edwards said.
The agency is strengthening its mechanisms for tracking population movement and protection monitoring in the corridors leading to the Dolo Ado and Dadaab refugee camps in Ethiopia and Kenya respectively.
“Our aim is that through shorter interval reporting we’ll be better able to inform emergency interventions,” Mr. Edwards said. “UNHCR is the primary provider of this information to UN agencies and NGOs operating in Somalia.”
“Given the very serious health state of many refugees arriving at camps in neighbouring countries, UNHCR believes it is of life-saving importance that people in Somalia are able to get help where they need it,” he said. “This may, in certain circumstances, mitigate the necessity to cross borders into neighbouring countries, where refugee camps were already bursting at the seams.”
UNHCR continues to look at all means to step up its efforts inside the country, he said."
drought,"In some areas of Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia and Uganda, drought conditions are the worst in 60 years, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in an update.
Almost half the of children arriving in refugees camps in Ethiopia from southern Somalia are malnourished, while 11 districts in Kenya have reported malnutrition rates above the 15 per cent emergency threshold. Supplementary and therapeutic feeding programmes are struggling to keep pace with the rising needs, according to OCHA.
Drought-related displacement and refugee flows are on the rise, with an average of 15,000 Somalis arriving in Kenya and Ethiopia every month this year seeking assistance.
“While conflict has been a fact of life for them for years, it is the drought that has taken them to breaking point. Many have walked for days, are exhausted, in poor health, desperate for food and water, and arriving in a worse condition than usual,” according to the OCHA update on the drought situation in the region.
The influx of Somalis into refugee camps in the Dadaab area of Kenya’s North-Eastern province – the largest refugee settlement in the world – has led to worsening overcrowding amid limited resources.
The drought has forced children out of school as both human and livestock diseases spread. Competition for the meagre resources is causing tensions among communities.
The price of grain in drought-affected areas of Kenya is 30 to 80 per cent more than the five-year average, according to OCHA, while in Ethiopia, the consumer price index for food increased by almost 41 per cent last month. Further food price hikes area expected in Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda and Somalia, but could ease after the next harvests expected later this year.
OCHA called for the scaling up of the emergency response in all affected areas, urging governments, donors and relief agencies step up efforts to prevent further deterioration.
Further funding is also required to enable humanitarian agencies to provide the necessary assistance. UN agencies and the partners this year requested 529 million for Somalia, but only 50 per cent of that amount has been received.
In Kenya, where 525 million is required, about 54 per cent of that money has been obtained so far. The appeal for Djibouti is for 39 million, but only 30 per cent has been received."
drought,"Djibouti is one of the smallest countries on the African continent. Situated between Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia, the total population is approximately 820,000 people. These factors alone make it an easy country to overlook in the context of the current drought. Next to the emergency crises in Kenya and Somalia, the needs of the drought-affected population may seem insignificant. Yet this is not a sufficient reason to neglect Djiboutians who are asking for help.
The IFRC together with the Djibouti Red Crescent have been undergoing an assessment throughout the country, and the needs are quite real. In Garabtisan village, northern Djibouti, there are approximately 1500 people - including 300 children - who have been facing a drought for the past five years.
“There is no public school for our children”, explained Madina, a mother of nine children. “We used to have a Koranic school, but the last wind storm knocked down the tree where lessons took place. Now, there is no place for children to learn.” It is a symbolic loss for this community who are on the brink of an emergency crisis.
In Garabtisan village, women such as Madina have only 40 litres of water for a period of 2 to 3 days to support the needs of an entire family. The nearest water source requires that women walk the distance of 23km, or they wait for water delivery from the military stationed nearby. But with a community of 1500 people, it is simply impossible for the military to adequately service the needs of Garabtisan village without support. In addition to high food prices, geographical isolation and the depletion of livestock, their situation is increasingly desperate.
Access to health care is another critical problem for women and children in Garabtisan village. When a child falls ill, the community is unable to respond. Each month there are approximately 6 to 7 births, with a loss of 2 to 3 children. The mobile health clinic provided by the Ministry of Health faces significant logistical challenges to reach the community as needed.
Yet the people of Garabtisan have dignity. Their cultural traditions practice basic hygiene such as washing children’s hands before eating, or defecating away from the home. Madina clearly wants to be a good mother, and meet the basic needs of her children.
The Djibouti Red Crescent and IFRC recognise the clear needs in drought-affected areas such as Garabtisan village. The Government of Djibouti has claimed there are 120,000 in need of critical assistance in rural areas. This indicates that 1 out of 8 persons are in need of emergency aid.
However the response cannot be successful by one agency or government ministry alone. Joint action is needed in Djibouti, in order to meet the challenges of drought-affected communities. Although the figures may be comparatively small to the rest of the Horn of Africa, women and mothers in desperate need, such as Madina, should be enough to take action."
drought,"The latest famine in Somalia has put a spotlight on the urgent need to develop national and regional drought policies, according to the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, which are jointly leading the international action to address the growing impact of droughts.
Drought is expected to continue in hard-hit southern Somalia during August and September, as well as parts of Ethiopia, Djibouti and Kenya, according to the latest WMO Climate Outlook Forum for the region, which provides regional climate forecasts. The IGAD Climate Prediction and Applications Centre (ICPAC) already called for preparedness for an ongoing long period of drought over parts of the equatorial region in its climate update for the Greater Horn of Africa on 15 January 2011.
Droughts have become more common over the past two decades. This is consistent with reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, stating that the world has become more drought-prone over the last 25 years, and will see an increased frequency of droughts in the future.
""Droughts do not happen overnight,"" said Luc Gnacadja, Executive Secretary of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), responding to the declaration of famine by the United Nations earlier this month. ""The UNCCD joins the calls on the international community to respond urgently to this crisis. At the same time, we stress the need for effective, long-term solutions to the root causes of famine in drought-prone regions, such as implementation of drought management systems and measures to stop desertification, which means land degradation in drylands.""
""We are moving forward quickly to provide integrated drought information to help decision-makers deal with drought, such as the one underway right now in East Africa,"" said Michel Jarraud, Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization. ""Drought is a serious and growing problem in many countries. Adaptation to drought, desertification and climate change urgently needs to be mainstreamed in national development policies.""
Mr Gnacadja visited Mr Jarraud at WMO earlier this month to discuss cooperation between the two organizations, following the UN declaration of famine for two provinces in southern Somalia on 13 July 2011. The two organizations have a long-standing partnership. Most recently they have championed the use of the Standard Precipitation Index, as a universal meteorological drought index to improve monitoring and climate risk management among countries."
drought,"More anthills than blades of grass are visible in some of the cracked earth around Junction. The year-long drought has plagued the town — as it has the rest of the state — and for a painful, six-week stretch, Junction banned all outdoor watering.
Some 4.5 inches of rain earlier this month increased the flow of the Llano River, two forks of which meet at the town. But the water is still pretty low — and four panelists at the Texas Water Symposium last week brought some unwelcome news to the townspeople: It’s not going to get any better anytime soon.
“As the state climatologist, people ask me, ‘When’s it going to rain?’” said John Nielsen-Gammon, one of the panelists, who is a professor of meteorology at Texas A&M University and the state's climatologist.
The answer, according to Nielsen-Gammon, is “eventually,” but chances are the drought will last another year, possibly even another decade.
The weather, or lack thereof, can be attributed to La Nia, a cyclical weather pattern resulting in cooler waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Meteorologists say that although La Nia had faded by the summer, it has now returned and is strengthening.
In the past 12 months, Texas has seen 11.1 inches of rainfall on average, according to Nielsen-Gammon, and it broke a heat record for the country that was previously set during the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. Texas AgriLife Extension Service estimates the cost of the drought to be about 5.2 billion, and that estimate — already out of date because it was compiled two months ago — doesn’t include the impact to several kinds of crops and the forestry industry.
Junction, known as the land of living waters, has seen some of its streams dry up. In August, town officials say, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality told Junction to cease outdoor water use of any kind when the town of Llano downstream reported it was close to running out of water."
drought,"In the cattle town of Emory in East Texas, the worst drought in state history is threatening a way of life. Scorching temperatures and a lack of rain have forced many ranchers to sell off their stock.
Normally before being brought to market, cattle are penned in a rancher's best pasture to be fattened. The heavier the cow, the more the buyer pays.
But the animals at a recent Emory auction look pitiful. They're standing in 107-degree heat — that's in the shade — with their ribs showing, stressed out. It's been like this for the past nine weeks — no rain. Although these cows were bred for the heat, they weren't bred for this. They look absolutely baked.
If this were a normal year, an August cattle auction in Emory would see maybe 100 to 200 head. There are more than 700 head today. And that's down from the more than 1,000 head sold here every Tuesday for much of this summer. The sad truth is, East Texas is starting to run out of stock to sell.
Inside the auction room, buyers in jeans and cowboy hats, here from Michigan and Wisconsin, Tennessee and Alabama, raise their fingers in front of their chests to bid. One cow, one calf, one bull after another, until late into the night. The Lone Star State is emptying itself of its cattle.
Stanley Austin is a rancher and a commission-order buyer, which means he buys livestock for farmers and feed yards. He has seen the drought's effects up close, at his family's ranch.
""We've had that place in our family for 75 years,"" he says, ""and it's never been without water. It's been without water now since about the 15th of June.""
Austin travels throughout Texas, going to seven livestock sales each week. He says the drought is going to alter the state's rural economies forever."
drought,"The United Nations’ food agency issued an alert on Tuesday warning that a severe drought was threatening the wheat crop in China, the world’s largest wheat producer, and resulting in shortages of drinking water for people and livestock.
China has been essentially self-sufficient in grain for decades, for national security reasons. Any move by China to import large quantities of food in response to the drought could drive international prices even higher than the record levels recently reached.
“China’s grain situation is critical to the rest of the world ? if they are forced to go out on the market to procure adequate supplies for their population, it could send huge shock waves through the world’s grain markets,” said Robert S. Zeigler, the director general of the International Rice Research Institute in Los Ba?os, in the Philippines.
The state-run news media in China warned Monday that the country’s major agricultural regions were facing their worst drought in 60 years. On Tuesday the state news agency Xinhua said that Shandong Province, a cornerstone of Chinese grain production, was bracing for its worst drought in 200 years unless substantial precipitation came by the end of this month.
World wheat prices are already surging, and they have been widely cited as one reason for protests in Egypt and elsewhere in the Arab world. A separate United Nations report last week said global food export prices had reached record levels in January. The impact of China’s drought on global food prices and supplies could create serious problems for less affluent countries that rely on imported food.
With 2.85 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, nearly three times that of Japan, the country with the second-largest reserves, China has ample buying power to prevent any serious food shortages."
drought,"Coyotes are stealing watermelons from backyard gardens, bees are attacking joggers trying to quench their thirst from drinking fountains, fighting for precious drops of water.
Texas state officials are planning now how to evacuate several endangered species at risk because of the record drought. The state is home to 86 threatened species.
Parched skies and relentless 100 degree heat are turning this summer into one of the worst in history here. Joggers run in the early morning before the heat intensifies; people working in downtown Houston seek shelter in the city's underground tunnel system rather than venturing out on the scorched city sidewalks. Football players practice in the morning to beat the heat, and children spend recess in air conditioned gyms at school.
The heat has driven wildlife into the open -- one homeowner southwest of Houston, who was wondering what was happening to his disappearing watermelon crop, set up a camera, and snapped a photo of a coyote in his backyard, stealing a watermelon.
Lynn Cuny is the director of the Wildlife Rescue Center in Kendalia, near San Antonio. Her group is running rescue services around the clock -- at last count she had 81 baby deer in her sanctuary.
Her advice to homeowners encountering wildlife in their backyards: ""Please be patient, these animals are desperate for water and often backyards are the only source.""
Deer are roaming in the middle of the day down Texas roads, and calls are coming in to animal control centers about raccoons, feral hogs, and other animals straying into yards in a desperate hunt for water that is not falling from the skies.
A drive past parched river beds illustrates the dilemma facing the biologists at Texas Parks and Wildlife."
drought,"As Texas continues to bake in record heat, the drought news for the state continues to be bleak – Texas is now in the midst of its most severe one-year drought on record, according to John Nielsen-Gammon, the Texas State Climatologist and professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University.
Preliminary reports from the National Climatic Data Center indicate that July 2011 was the warmest month ever recorded statewide for Texas, with data going back to 1895, Nielsen-Gammon reports. The average temperature of 87.2 degrees broke the previous record of 86.5 degrees set in 1998. The June average temperature of 85.2 was a record for that month and now ranks fifth warmest overall.
Rainfall totals were also unusually light across the state. The July monthly total of 0.72 inches ranks third driest, surpassed by the 0.69 inches recorded in both 1980 and 2000. This is the fifth consecutive month in which precipitation totals were among the 10 driest for that month, says the Texas A&M professor.
Among the other rainfall records set this month: least year-to-date precipitation (6.53 inches; historical average 16.03 inches; previous record 9.36 inches in 1917); driest consecutive 8, 9 and 10 months on record (7.25 inches 8.35 inches, and 9.17 inches respectively); and driest 12 months ending in July (15.16 inches, previous record 16.46 inches in 1925)."
drought,"The drought and the massive displacement of people in the Horn of Africa, in addition to conflict and violence, high food prices, and dwindling resources, has resulted in one of the most dramatic global humanitarian crises.
According to the latest reports by the World Food Programme, some 10 million people are affected by the Horn of Africa's worst drought in 60 years.
Two consecutive rainy seasons have failed, producing a decline of more than 25% of rain for pastoral areas in Somalia, Northern and Eastern Kenya, Southern and Eastern Ethiopia and Djibouti. As a result harvests have failed, livestock mortality has soared, and food and water have become extremely expensive.
The price of food for essential cereals like maize has increased 2,5 times in Eastern Kenya, Eastern Ethiopia and Southern Somalia. Millions of people in the region cannot meet basic survival needs, and emergency levels of acute malnutrition are widespread.
In most areas affected by the drought, malnutrition is affecting over 30% of people, which is more than double the internationally recognized emergency threshold. Those who can are leaving their land and their homes to walk long distances trying to find food and water. Many Somalis are crossing borders to do that. An estimated 3,000 people a day are arriving in Kenya and Ethiopia from Somalia in search for a help.
The crisis is expected to worsen over the coming three to four months. ""If we don't act now, famine will spread to all eight regions of southern Somalia within two months, due to poor harvests and infectious disease outbreaks,"" told Mark Bowden, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Somalia. 
Recovery is not expected until next year, given the expected late and below-average harvests, the depletion of pasture and water and the high prices of food, water, and fuel. This is why the rapid scaling-up of the emergency response is vital to address the humanitarian needs and to prevent further deterioration."
