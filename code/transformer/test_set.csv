wildfires,"More and more of Alaska’s boreal forests are burning each year, according to a study released last week. Researchers found that the acreage of forest burned in interior Alaska has climbed almost five-fold since 1943. That increase is likely influenced by a regional shift to a warmer, drier climate, as well as by human disturbances like encroaching development and fire suppression. Researchers found that that increase was most pronounced in the region’s most populated area, where firefighting efforts are most intense.
Thanks to its size and the remoteness of much of the state, Alaska has had to take a highly targeted approach to fighting wildfires. In the 1980s, the state established four zones of fire response, depending on whether the events happen near human settlement, whether there are valuable natural resources in the area and how likely the fire is to spread. The state’s population hubs, like Anchorage and Fairbanks, are designated as “critical” zones and receive the most protection — which often means fire suppression.
In a concerning twist, the study’s authors found the steepest increase in area burned has been in the highest tiers of protection. Fairbanks, the most populated area they looked at, was the most glaring example: on average, 12.4 percent more acreage burns there each year than the previous one.  
The reasons for that increase are likely complicated and include the region’s logging history. In Fairbanks, in particular, the landscape was basically denuded in the 1900s, thanks to the gold rush. Miners cut down the region’s forests to build homes and mining infrastructure and to burn to heat the frozen soil for digging. In the 100 years since, the forests have grown back and slowly gone through their natural succession, from the relatively fireproof willows and birches to the flammable black spruce."
wildfires,"A bushfire which threatened properties in the lower south-east of South Australia is now within containment lines.
It is in scrub and farmland at Marcollat, west of Padthaway, and was first reported about noon ACDT on Sunday.
The Country Fire Service (CFS) said thick scrub and sandy terrain posed challenges for fire crews.
The fire jumped the containment lines several times overnight, but is now within the breaks.
The greatest risk remains that the fire could spread north, but temperatures were lower on Monday and winds light, after Sunday saw temperatures in the low 40s and northerly winds of up to 40kph.
Residents at Lucindale, Naracoorte and Padthaway were being warned to keep doors and windows closed, because of smoke.
Regional fire commander Jason Druwitt said more local fire crews had been brought in on Monday morning, to help with mopping up efforts.
""The plan is to release all the crews from the fire ground at 1700,"" he said.
He said it was hoped all the firefighters could be home for Christmas and local landholders would keep watch until crews were again in the area on Boxing Day.
At the height of the blaze, there were four water bombers, 25 fire appliances and about 100 firefighters tackling the outbreak.
The CFS said an irrigation pump fire sparked the wider blaze, which blackened about 6,000 hectares."
earthquake,"SANTIAGO, CHILE - A 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck Saturday off the coast of Antarctica, with authorities issuing a tsunami warning for Chile's Eduardo Frei base on the frigid continent, emergency officials said.
The quake struck at 8:36 p.m. local time (2336 GMT) about 210 kilometers east of the base at a depth of 10 kilometers, Chile's National Emergency Office (Onemi) said, urging evacuation from ""the beach area of the Antarctic"" ahead of a possible tsunami.
The Chilean air force's base is the country's largest in Antarctica and includes a village, hospital, school, bank, post office and chapel.
The maximum population in summer is 150 people, and the average population in winter is 80.
An unrelated 5.9-magnitude earthquake struck near Santiago on Saturday night, but Onemi said no significant damage or impact was reported.
Chile is one of the most seismically active countries in the world. An 8.8 magnitude temblor in Concepcion on February 27, 2010, left more than 500 dead.
The country suffered the most powerful earthquake ever recorded 60 years ago — measuring 9.6 magnitude — in Valdivia."
earthquake,"After Alaska earthquake, offshore quake strikes west of Vancouver Island In the wake of a powerful earthquake that hit off the Alaskan coast late last night, an early-morning offshore quake struck west of Vancouver Island. The quake occurred at 4:33 a.m. today (July 22). Earthquakes Canada measured it as a 5.1-magnitude quake, while the U.S. Geological Survey assessed it as a 5.4-magnitude quake. According to Earthquakes Canada, the epicentre, at a depth of eight kilometres (five miles), was located 220 kilometres (138 miles) southwest of Port Alice, 326 kilometres (203 miles) southwest of Campbell River, 443 kilometres (275 miles) west of Victoria, and 458 kilometres (285 miles) west of Vancouver."
Typhoon,"While tropical systems in the Atlantic Basin have been sputtering, leaving many breathing a sigh of relief, a typhoon in the Western Pacific had thousands of Americans on edge.
Danas, at one time a typhoon packing winds of 145 miles per hour, made a beeline toward the Japanese island of Okinawa. Okinawa is the home to Kadena Air Force base, which houses more than 18,000 American military personnel and their families. Luckily, Danas didn't make a direct hit on the island or the base and no immediate reports of damage were available.  
In an email to The Weather Channel the public affairs office on Kadena Air Force base says they used a graduated system of warnings, ranging from TC-4 to TC-1.  TC-4 is a general state of readiness where people have the basic essentials already stocked away. TC-1 is where 50 knot or greater winds are expected within 12 hours.  It also means that all facilities, except mission critical components, will be closed and people should fill available containers with drinking water.  While at TC-1 earlier in the day Tuesday, the bas has now been backed down to TC-4 and normal activities can resume.
As for staying informed about the latest, in the States, Kadena's public affairs office says this: ""Stateside friends and family like the Kadena Air Base Facebook page, and many people have already liked that page so they can keep up with what their family and friends are doing overseas.""
 Danas quickly weakened to a tropical storm after crossing the Japanese island of Tsushima, between South Korea and the Japanese mainland. And continued on a northeasterly course.
According to South Korean broadcaster KBS, Busan port closed for a bit as the former typhoon passed the region. The port is South Korea's largest."
wildfires,"During the July 4 weekend, the U.S. Forest Service issued urgent instructions to hikers and campers to be exceedingly cautious in lighting campfires across California’s tinder dry Sierra Nevada mountain range. Embers that escaped almost two years ago from a campfire in the thickly wooded slopes east of this Gold Rush era town ignited the 104,000-hectare (257,000-acre) Rim Fire that burned for two months and is ranked by Cal Fire, a state firefighting agency, as the third largest wildfire in California’s history.
All across the 640-kilometer (400-mile) Sierra range, which runs nearly the length of California’s eastern border, state and federal forest agencies are preparing for a miserable season of fire. The same is true across much of the American West and Alaska where winter snows, and spring and early summer rain, have been scant."
wildfires,"Fires continue to rage at high levels through the Amazon in Brazil for the second consecutive year, raising concerns among scientists that the rainforest's destruction could eventually reach a point of no return.
Since Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro took office, governmental measures to curb illegal fires have shown little impact, as flames and deforestation erase vast swathes of the world's biggest rainforest.
Most fires in the Amazon are set by land-grabbers and wildcat ranchers, seeking to transform parts of the rainforest into their own lucrative agricultural enterprises. And this August was a particularly bad time for such fires: Preliminary data collected by the National Spatial Research Institute (INPE) show 29,307 fires in the Brazilian Amazon last month.
However, due to a technical issue with the NASA satellite tracking fires, experts say that figure could be even higher. The final tally of fires recorded in August is expected to rise 2% above the August 2019 total, says Albert Setzer, INPE's senior scientist -- which would make this August the worst in 10 years.
The more fires there are, the faster the rainforest is transformed into grasslands for illicit cattle and soy-growing operations. According to research from NGO MapBiomas, which tracks land use in Brazil, 95% of the deforested area in Brazil in 2019 wasn't authorized. ""Most of (the fires) are illegal,"" said Tasso Azevedo, a former head of Brazil's forest service and coordinator of MapBiomas.
Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon biome reached 1,830 square miles, an area bigger than Rhode Island state, in the period from January to July 2020,. August figures for deforestation are yet to be released."
earthquake,"At least 9 dead in Turkey after magnitude 5.7 earthquake strikes northwest Iran ISTANBUL — Nine people died and hundreds of buildings collapsed in southeastern Turkey on Sunday after a magnitude-5.7 earthquake struck near the border with Iran, injuring dozens in villages and towns in both countries, government officials said. Three of those killed were children and 37 Turkish people were injured, including nine critically, Turkey's health ministry said. The shallow tremor caused more than 1,000 buildings to collapse in Turkey, prompting a brief rescue effort to find those trapped under rubble. The quake damaged buildings some 56 miles to the west in the Turkish city of Van, and to the east in dozens of villages in Iran, where state TV said 75 people were injured including six in hospital, though there were no fatalities. Turkish TV footage showed people digging with shovels and their hands in the rubble, as well as furniture and belongings strewn on cracked and snowy roads. In one village the ground cratered under several buildings, while in others residents were wrapped in blankets outside homes with crumbled and cracked exterior walls, fallen metal roofs and twisted wiring. ""The damage caused loss of life,"" the governor of Van, Mehmet Bilmez, told reporters standing in front of a pile of cinder blocks and sheet metal. ""There is destruction in all four villages"" he visited on Sunday morning, he added. The European Mediterranean Seismological Center (EMSC) said the quake, which hit at 8:53 a.m. local time, had a depth of 3.1 miles. Broadcasters and government officials said dozens of villages were rattled in Turkey, which like Iran has a history of powerful earthquakes. Nearly 150 tents were sent to shelter families in the region, where several schools in the districts of Baskale, Saray and Gurpinar sustained minor damage."
earthquake,"Magnitude 6.9 quake strikes the coasts of Russia and Japan A powerful earthquake struck off the southeast coast of Russia's Kuril Islands early Thursday morning. The USGS reports a magnitude 6.9 earthquake hit 2:33 a.m. Thursday local time, in an area northeast of Japan. While shaking was reported in the Japanese island of Hokkaido, there were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. The Japan Meterological Agency reported no tsunami threat to Japan, while the U.S. Tsunami Warning System said there was no tsunami threat to Guam and Saipan. There are 56 islands in the Kuril Islands, with many of them being rock formations. These islands are part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, an arc of fault lines, that leave this region vulnerable to sizeable earthquakes."
earthquake,"An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 struck off southern Alaska's coast late Tuesday, shaking the Alaska Peninsula and briefly sparking tsunami concerns before officials said no destructive waves were coming.
The earthquake was centered in the Pacific Ocean about 60 miles southeast of Perryville on the sparsely populated Alaska Peninsula, striking around 10:12 p.m. local time (2:12 a.m. Wednesday ET).
The Alaska Peninsula protrudes from mainland Alaska and is flanked to the southwest by the Aleutian Islands.
Reports of significant damage, if any, weren't immediately available. A tsunami warning initially was issued for south Alaska and the Alaska Peninsula, but was canceled by early Wednesday, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The warning sent people to higher ground in cities like Sand Point, an island community of about 1,000 people off the peninsula, the Anchorage Daily News reported.
People in Sand Point gathered at a high school until shortly after midnight, when officials gave an all-clear, Jordan Keeler, an Anchorage-based city administrator, told the newspaper.
""The first wave didn't materialize, which is a great thing,"" Keeler, who was in contact with staff in Sand Point, told the Anchorage Daily News. No reports of major structural damage were made on the island, Keeler told the newspaper.
""We've canceled the (tsunami) advisories because it doesn't look like it's becoming a large wave or any larger,"" National Tsunami Warning Center Director James Gridley said, according to CNN affiliate KTUU.
Strong shaking was reported on the peninsula, the USGS said. Light to weak shaking was reported around Kodiak, about 300 miles northeast of the quake's center, and in Anchorage, some 530 miles from the center, according to the USGS.
In Kodiak, a city of about 6,000 people, a long line of cars headed up a mountain after residents learned of the tsunami warning late Tuesday, John Cannon told KTUU.
Police were ""trying to clear the lower areas down by the harbor,"" he said.
""You (could) hear the tsunami alarms. It's rather eerie,"" he told KTUU.
This quake's depth was 28 kilometers, or 17 miles, the USGS said -- relatively shallow.
""Anything below 70 kilometers is considered a shallow quake,"" CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar said. ""That's important, because shallow earthquakes often cause the most damage, compared to the ones that are deeper, regardless of the strength.""
More than 20 aftershocks followed the quake late Tuesday to early Wednesday, ranging from magnitudes of 2.8 to 6.1."
Typhoon,"At least 20 people have been killed and 50 others missing in Japan after the country's western coast was hit by typhoon Talas on Sunday.
The typhoon has unleashed heavy rains, triggering landslides, and is slowly moving north. The government has ordered evacuation of 460,000 people in western and central Japan. Hundreds of people are still stranded as the rescue efforts are being hampered by flooded rivers and collapsed bridges, local agencies report.
The typhoon has caused record amount of rainfall in some areas, making it the worst storm to hit the country since 2004.
Talas has damaged Nijojo castle, designated as an important cultural treasure and a popular tourist attraction in the ancient city of Kyoto.
Public broadcaster NHK showed a bridge swept away after torrential rain. People holding umbrellas waded through knee-deep water in city streets and residential areas. Many cars were washed away in the floods.
Japan's meteorological agency warned of more heavy rains, strong winds, floods and landslides. It has issued landslide warnings in nearly all of the country's prefectures."

earthquake,"A massive earthquake of 6.4 magnitude hit Assam on Wednesday morning, causing widespread damage in the Northeast state, officials said.
Tremors were felt in the entire region, including neighbouring Meghalaya and northern parts of West Bengal, they said.
The earthquake hit Sonitpur district at 7.51 am, they added.
It was followed by two more jerks of 4.3 and 4.4 magnitudes at 7.58 am and 8.01 am, respectively.Most parts of the region felt the impact of the massive earthquake as people ran out of their homes and other places in panic.
Many buildings in Tezpur, the district headquarters of Sonitpur, Guwahati and other places developed cracks.
Detailed reports are awaited regarding casualty."
Typhoon,"Another busy hurricane season appears likely, although it won’t be as bad as last year, according to a prediction released Wednesday by AccuWeather, a private weather forecasting service.
The prediction calls for seven to 10 hurricanes. Three to five of these are expected to reach major hurricane strength, which means winds of at least 111 mph.
“Current indications are this will be another above-normal season,” said Dan Kottlowski, AccuWeather’s lead hurricane forecaster. “This can translate into high impacts on the United States.”
The season still is unlikely to be as busy as last year’s record-breaking season, which generated 30 storms, including 13 hurricanes, subjecting the United States to 12 direct hits and exhausting the storm names selected for that year.
But the danger to the U.S. east coast may be higher this year because of the weakening of the Bermuda high, a high-pressure zone that last year stiff-armed many storms into the Gulf of Mexico. This year, the Bermuda high’s rim could be farther northeast, allowing storms to curve north earlier and strike the east coast.
The Accu-Weather forecast cited warm Atlantic temperatures as one factor in the prediction of an active season.
Hurricane season officially starts June 1, although there’s been discussion of shifting the date into May, since the past few years have produced several pre-season storms."
wildfires,"Record-breaking temperatures and months of severe drought have fuelled a series of massive bushfires across Australia.
Although recent cooler conditions and rain have brought some respite, more than 50 fires are still burning in the states of New South Wales and Victoria.
Hot and windy conditions are forecast to return to many parts of New South Wales this weekend and authorities in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) have declared a state of emergency as massive bushfires rage south of Canberra.
At least 33 people have been killed - including four firefighters - and more than 11 million hectares (110,000 sq km or 27.2 million acres) of bush, forest and parks across Australia has burned."

Laura is the seventh named storm to landfall in the US this season, which has just begun what is traditionally its most intense period. It intensified within 24 hours from a Category 1 to a strong Category 4 on the Saffir Simson hurricane scale.
According to news reports, some 1,500 people are being sent into Louisiana for rescue and clean up missions, including troops from the National Guard. 
Winds of up to 150 mph caused severe damage, including the death of at least six people, and left half a million homes without power.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards tweeted that the hurricane has left roads flooded and wildlife displaced, warning people to stay vigilant."
earthquake,"A magnitude-7.0 earthquake occurred in the far southern Philippine Sea off the coast of southeastern Mindano region of the Philippines. The epicenter was approximately 210 km (130 miles) southeast of Pondaguitan, Philippines. The tremor occurred at a depth of about 95.8 km (59.5 miles), and moderate-to-strong shaking was probably felt in the Philippine Sea near the epicenter. Weak-to-light shaking was probably felt in far southeastern Mindanao region. There have been no initial reports of damage or casualties as a result of the earthquake; however, significant damage is unlikely in the Philippines due to the depth and location of this event. It could take several hours until authorities can conduct comprehensive damage assessments, especially in remote areas. Aftershocks are likely over the coming days. The event has not prompted any tsunami advisories.Officials may temporarily shut down transportation infrastructure in the tremor zone to check for damage. Minor disruptions could occur during shutdowns, but service will likely resume quickly if no damage is found. Utility outages are possible, particularly near the earthquake's epicenter."
Typhoon,"With one of the largest storms seen for years bearing down upon the Korean Peninsula, both Koreas have today warned of the potential for danger.
Chosun Central News Agency reported on the approach of ‘Typhoon Bolaven’ this afternoon, saying, “Typhoon-15 is now moving northwestward at a velocity of 12km/h, as of 09:00 Thursday.”
“It is expected to come to the sea off Shanghai, China on around August 27th and move northward along the west coastal area of Korea before reaching the Chinese northeastern region on the evening of August 28th. The typhoon-15 will trigger strong wind and heavy rains in overall areas of Korea on August 27th and 28th,” the brief report added.
According to South Korea’s meteorological authorities, meanwhile, Typhoon Bolaven was 460km south of Sogwipo, the largest city on the south coast of Jeju Island, at 12PM today, moving at 34km/h in a north-northwesterly direction. It appears set to make landfall over Hwanghae Province in North Korea late on the afternoon of the 28th.
With that particular region only just recovering from serious flooding, the typhoon is likely to be an unwelcome, and damaging, addition to what has been a difficult summer."
other,"Japan Mount Ontake volcano: Death toll reaches 47 Rescue workers in Japan have recovered more bodies from Mount Ontake, bringing to 47 the number of those killed by Saturday's volcanic eruption. The search resumed despite fears of toxic gases and another eruption. The number of those unaccounted for is unknown but estimates say hundreds were at the summit at the time. Dozens were injured by falling debris. Since then, volcanic tremors have been continuously detected with smoke still coming out of the volcano. Police had earlier put the latest death toll at 48 but then revised it down by one. The majority of bodies found near the summit on Wednesday were hikers, according to local police. Helicopters have been used to bring the dead down from Mount Ontake. Around 1,000 troops, police and fire fighters are involved in rescue operations."
drought,"A severe drought is threatening South Africa's wildlife industry, with game farmers keeping fewer animals and tourists visiting game lodges in smaller numbers.
Parts of the country have been affected by consecutive years of abnormally hot weather and below average rainfall that have scorched grazing lands and dried up watering holes since 2015, the driest year on record.
Industry body Wildlife Ranching South Africa (WRSA) estimates the Northern Cape province has lost more than two-thirds of its game over the last three years.
It is conducting a countrywide survey to determine the scale of animal losses and the financial impact on the country's more than 9,000 wildlife ranches.
“It's been an extraordinary drought,” said WRSA chief Adri Kitshoff-Botha. “It's not a one-year or two-year drought. In some areas we've seen it has been going now for six years.”
The wildlife industry generates revenue for South Africa through tourism, hunting, breeding and meat production.
Trophy hunting alone generated 2bn rand (£106m) in 2016, according to research carried out for the environment ministry.
Southern Africa's temperatures are rising at twice the global average rate, according to the International Panel on Climate Change, and in much of South Africa the level of water in reservoirs is dwindling.
For Burger Schoeman, manager at Northern Cape game farm Thuru Lodge, the withered vegetation and parched ground are a serious concern for the sector.
Once home to around 4,500 wild animals _ including 35 different species, from antelope to rhino _ the lodge has lost around 1,000 animals due to drought. Carcasses are piling up in abandoned mines on the edge of the property.
“At this stage we are quite stretched. All the money you get from selling the animals, meat and all of that, gets put straight back into the property to look after the rest of the animals,” Mr Schoeman said."
Typhoon,"Hundreds of people have been rescued after Hurricane Sally _ which has since transformed into a tropical storm _ made landfall in Alabama and Florida on Wednesday morning.
The storm arrived as a Category 2 hurricane in Gulf Shores, Alabama, around 4.45am with 105mph winds and rain depths in the feet, not inches, flooding homes and streets _ as people were forced to evacuate from the southern coast.
Some areas have already been hit with 24 inches of rain, and a total of 35 inches could come in parts of Florida and Alabama, according to the National Weather Service. Why specific areas were getting hammered with high rains was due, in part, to how slowly the storm was moving. It was traveling at just 7mph up the coastal states.
First responders used boats and high water vehicles in parts of Florida and Alabama to rescue hundreds of trapped residents while Hurricane Sally transformed into a tropical storm, with winds decreasing to 70mph.
The rescues came after some of the areas hit the hardest were not issued mandatory evacuations. Residents were encouraged to voluntarily leave, but some people still stayed behind in their homes.
“At one point we were grabbing things to evacuate because the water was starting to get up to the second level and then by that point it was too late for us to go anywhere,"" Kirsten Colla, who lives in a townhouse on Escambia Bay in Pensacola, Florida, told weather.com."
earthquake,"A powerful earthquake of 6.4 magnitude killed at least six people as it tore down buildings in central Croatia today, as rescuers combed toppled roofs and rubble in the dark.
The tremors were felt as far afield as Vienna while the damage was concentrated in and around Petrinja, a town some 50 kilometres south of Croatia's capital Zagreb. 
Rescuers tried to pull people from the rubble of collapsed buildings, television footage showed, and army troops were sent in to the area to help.
As rescue teams shovelled away bricks and other debris, some elderly residents gathered in a park in downtown Petrinja, wrapped in blankets and afraid to return home. 
""All the tiles in the bathroom are broken, all the dishes fell out"", Marica Pavlovic, a 72-year-old retired meat factory worker, told AFP of the damage to her home.  
""Even if we wanted to, we can't go back in, there is no electricity."" 
The GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences said the quake hit at a depth of 10km. The epicentre was in the town of Petrinja, 50km south of the Croatian capital Zagreb.
Tomislav Fabijanic, head of emergency medical services in nearby Sisak, said many people had been injured in Petrinja and in Sisak.
""There are fractures, there are concussions and some had to be operated on,"" he said.
Prime Minister Adrej Plenkovic, who rushed to Petrinja, said: ""The army is here to help. We will have to move some people from Petrinja because it is unsafe to be here."""
earthquake,"SANTIAGO, Chile — A strong earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.8 struck off the coast of northern Chile in the first minutes of Tuesday, the U.S. Geological Survey said.
There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage and the Chilean navy said there was no possibility of a tsunami.
The quake occurred at 12:09 a.m. local time at a depth of 35 kilometers (22 miles). It was centered 78 kilometers (48 miles) northeast of the Atacama city of Vallenar. A few minutes later, a second quake occurred with a preliminary magnitude of 6.3.
The quake was felt as far south as the capital, Santiago, and in Antofagasta, 1,330 kilometers (826 miles) further north.
Video from the scene showed windows rattling and items falling to the ground. Local radio stations reported that boulders broke off hills. The electricity was briefly cut off.
Chile is located in the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire and often experiences large earthquake. The last major quake, on Feb. 27, 2010, set off tsunamis and killed 526 people."
wildfires,"Mandatory evacuations for the Waldo Canyon Fire were expanded Wednesday to include the town of Crystola (in El Paso and Teller counties) and the south and east sides of Woodland Park.
Fire officials said at an afternoon news briefing that wind was a big factor in fighting the blaze on Wednesday.
Colorado Springs Fire Chief Rich Brown said that on Wednesday, as was the case Tuesday, conditions are “erratic.”
He added: We “put out as many burning embers and hotspots as we can.”
Incident Commander Rich Harvey concurred. “I hate wind  Wind is big factor in how we do this fire. It won’t stay in the same place. The winds keep shifting on us.”
He said fire managers are expecting thunderstorms as a cold front moves in from Denver.
A lot of people expressed concern because Wednesday’s weather mirrors Tuesday’s. Harvey said everyone saw firsthand how quickly the fire can move.
“We’re learning its tricks,” Harvey said of the fire’s propensity to make quick runs.
The El Paso County Sheriff’s office announced about 1 p.m. that the pre-evacuation area had been expanded to Holland Park and Pleasant Valley. Minutes later the pre-evacuation notice was expanded to include the communities of Palmer Lake and Monument, north of the Air Force Academy to County Line Road and west of Interstate 25.
Fear of weather and wind changes caused a mandatory evacuation of about 3,000 people in Woodland Park and part of Teller County this morning.
A mandatory evacuation order was issued around 11:30 a.m. for areas east of Highway 24 to Baldwin Street, which turns into Rampart Range Road.
According to Woodland Park Mayor David Turley, the city is responding well and things are, for the most part, calm."
Typhoon,"The second powerful typhoon to slam Japan in a week unleashed fierce winds and rain on southern islands on Sunday, blowing off rooftops and leaving homes without power as it edged northward into an area vulnerable to flooding and mudslides
Weather officials warned that the rainfall from what could be a record storm would be fierce. Warnings were issued days in advance for people to be ready to take shelter and stock up on food and water.
Several rivers on the main southwestern island of Kyushu were at risk of overflowing, officials said. Public broadcaster NHK TV said evacuation warnings were issued for more than 50,000 people in Okinawa and Kyushu, including Kagoshima and and Nagasaki prefectures.
News footage showed people in Kyushu starting to gather at gymnasiums, before winds gather momentum in the evening. Social distancing will be in place to guard against the coronavirus pandemic, officials said.
The Japan Meteorological Agency said Typhoon Haishen, which means “sea god” in Chinese, was packing sustained winds of up to 162 kilometers (100 miles) per hour after battering Okinawa and the southern Kyushu island of Amami Oshima early Sunday. Alerts for strong winds, waves, high tides, rainfall and lightning were issued for Amami Oshima alongside evacuation orders.
There were no immediate reports of any injuries in Okinawa, home to more than half of the roughly 50,000 U.S. troops based in Japan under a bilateral treaty.
Haishen was not only powerful — equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane — but also large in its reach, according to the meteorological agency.
Bullet trains were temporarily halting services, and dozens of flights were canceled. All Nippon Airways said such cancellations will continue Monday and possibly on Tuesday for flights in southern Japan, such as Yamaguchi, Kochi and Fukuoka.
Haishen’s projected course has it hitting the Korean Peninsula later in the week.
Haishen’s course is similar to Typhoon Maysak, which lashed southern Japan last week, injuring dozens of people and cutting power to thousands of homes.
A cargo ship carrying 43 crew members and 5,800 cows from New Zealand capsized off the coast of Japan. Two people were rescued, and one body was recovered. The search has been halted because of Haishen."
wildfires,"Some residents cried as they walked through the rubble of their homes while others shared amazing stories of survival as more people returned to their houses Tuesday and surveyed the twisted metal and smoking ruins left behind by a devastating California wildfire.
Gary Herrin sobbed as he walked through what had been his childhood home in Middletown.
""Yep, grew up here, was able to walk to school from here. Many friends lived close by,"" Herrin recalled, looking around. ""There's a lot of good people here, but it's a ghost town now, it's really eerie.”
His brother had been living in the home and members of his extended family resided nearby.
""I go to my brother-in-law's house, my niece's house, and there's nothing, nothing, ashes,"" Herrin said.
A number of people saw the devastation for the first time since the massive flames sped Saturday through rural Lake County, less than 160 kilometres north of San Francisco.
Aided by drought, it has consumed more than 269 square kilometres and was 30 per cent contained.
Fire investigators working to determine what caused the massive blaze have narrowed their focus to an area in the community of Cobb, where the blaze was first spotted, said California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokesman Daniel Berlant.
What sparked the blaze remains under investigation, he said.
Authorities say 585 homes were known to be destroyed, and the number was expected to increase. Another 9,000 structures remained threatened.
The Lake County fire and another blaze about 193 kilometres to the southeast have displaced 23,000 people and were the worst of a dozen wildfires burning in the state. The Lake County fire spread into northern Napa County, but the region's famous wine valley was not threatened.
Rancher Lisa Comstock said she and her three dogs survived the raging fire in rural Middletown by jumping into a water trough as flames neared her home."
Typhoon,"The Philippines on Wednesday began tallying the damage bill from powerful Typhoon Nesat, which killed at least 21 people and left behind flooded towns, overflowing dams and damage to rice crops across northern Luzon island.
As the typhoon moved over the South China Sea towards northern Vietnam and southern China, Manila said efforts to find dozens of people still missing were being hindered by bad weather.
Financial markets, government offices and some schools reopened after being closed by the typhoon, and train services resumed after power supplies were restored in the capital. However, some flights were again cancelled on Wednesday."

Rwanda's Emergency Management Ministry said that at least 8,000 people crossed the border into the country following the eruption. ""This morning, after lava flows from Nyiragongo volcano have stopped, most of Congolese evacuated to Rubavu are returning back home,"" the ministry said."
drought,"Arizona is getting a jump start on what will be a yearslong process to address a dwindling but key water source in the U.S. West.
Several states and Mexico rely on the Colorado River for drinking water and growing crops. But climate change, drought and demand have taken a toll on the river that no longer can deliver what was promised in the 1920s.
Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, California, Utah, Wyoming and Nevada have been operating under a set of guidelines approved in 2007. Those guidelines and an overlapping drought contingency plan will expire in 2026.
Arizona water officials gathered Thursday to outline a plan for what comes next. Other states in the river basin have had more informal discussions.
“Hold on to your seats because the reconsultation will be technical and complicated, and it will take a long time,” said Ted Cooke, general manager of the Central Arizona Project, who is co-chairing Arizona’s effort.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation is reviewing the effectiveness of the 2007 guidelines that address shortages and surpluses of water, and efforts to conserve water in Lake Mead along the Nevada-Arizona border. A draft is expected in August, and a final report in December.
“It’s prudent water management to review how well something has worked before determining what might replace it,” said Carly Jerla of the Bureau of Reclamation.
When those guidelines went into effect, the river had been in drought conditions for several years. It hasn’t let up. A drought contingency plan approved by the Western states last year was meant as a stop-gap. It requires Arizona, Nevada and Mexico to prop up Lake Mead earlier than under the 2007 guidelines. It also looped in California for water cuts.
A Reclamation audit published last month found that water use in the Colorado River’s lower basin dropped by more than 575,000 acre-feet from 2018 to 2019, a level not seen since 1986. That allowed Lake Mead and Lake Powell — key indicators of the river’s health — to increase by several feet but both remain well below capacity.
As of this week, Mead was 41% full. Powell, along the Arizona-Utah line, was 53% full.
Arizona is looking to build upon the work done on the drought contingency plan. The committee of about three dozen people that worked it helps develop what might replace the existing guidelines, focusing on how to sustain the river while meeting the state’s water needs, officials said."
other,"Volcano erupts near Congolese city of Goma; residents flee GOMA _ Congo’s Mount Nyiragongo erupted for the first time in nearly two decades Saturday, turning the night sky a fiery red and sending lava onto a major highway as panicked residents tried to flee Goma, a city of nearly 2 million. There was no immediate word on any casualties, but witnesses said that lava already had engulfed one highway that connects Goma with the city of Beni in North Kivu province. Mount Nyiragongo’s last eruption, in 2002, left hundreds dead and coated airport runways in lava. More than 100,000 people were left homeless in the aftermath, adding to the fear in Goma on Saturday night."
wildfires,"Firefighters are battling to keep a large bushfire which has come within 700 metres of a small township on an Australian holiday island at bay.
Dozens of residents of Happy Valley were earlier urged to evacuate as the blaze raged east across Fraser Island.
For six weeks, firefighters have been struggling to control the blazes on the island - a popular tourist destination off the coast of Queensland.
However efforts have been thwarted by a continuing heatwave and dry ground.
The bushfire was sparked by an illegal campfire in mid-October and has burnt through over half of the island - about 83,000 hectares."
earthquake,"Many residents of the Southern Zone didn’t need an alarm to wake up early on Friday morning.
A magnitude 6.0 earthquake shook southern Costa Rica and northern Panama at 6:41 a.m., the Volcanological and Seismological Observatory of Costa Rica (OVSICORI) said.
The epicenter was estimated at 37.6 km southwest of Puerto Armuelles, Panama.
The National Emergency Commission (CNE) has not reported any damages in Costa Rica. The earthquake was felt throughout the Southern Zone and in the city of David, Panama, OVSICORI said.
“This is an earthquake that occurs in a region where three tectonic plates interact: the Cocos plate, the Nazca plate, and the Panama plate,” an OVSICORI spokesperson said.
OVSICORI reported several smaller aftershocks throughout Friday morning.
Costa Rica averages 350 earthquakes each month — about 12 each day — though most are imperceptible."
earthquake,"On 15 January 2021, a 6.2 magnitude earthquake hit Majene, West Sulawesi Province in the early hours of the morning killing at least 81?people, injuring more than 630, and over 15,000 homeless.
More than 15,000 people have been temporarily displaced in 15 IDP sites, and figures are increasing.
The quake severely damaged buildings and houses, including a hospital that was completely flattened, trapping dozens of patients and staff in the rubble. Preliminary assessments indicate that 17 schools have been damaged.
Heavy rains in recent days have made access very difficult, blocking the main road to the affected areas.
The first priority is to search for survivors who have been trapped under the rubble, and to tend to the wounded.
This disaster comes nearly two and a half years after a massive earthquake and tsunami killed thousands in Central Sulawesi. Indonesia sits within the Pacific Ring of Fire, the world’s most disaster-prone area marked by floods, tsunamis and earthquakes."
other,"Shares of Chinese companies listed in the US have seen their biggest two-day fall since the 2008 financial crisis.
The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index, which follows the 98 biggest US-listed Chinese stocks, has fallen by almost 15% in the last two trading sessions.
The index has now plummeted by more than 45% since hitting a record high in February.
The slump comes after a series of crackdowns by Beijing on its technology and education industries.
This has led to around $770bn (£556bn) being wiped off the value of US-listed Chinese stocks in the last five months alone.
The latest blow came as Beijing unveiled a massive overhaul of China's $120bn private tutoring sector, under which all institutions offering tuition on school curricula will be registered as non-profit organisations.
The new rules also said: ""Curriculum subject-tutoring institutions are not allowed to go public for financing; listed companies should not invest in the institutions, and foreign capital is barred from such institutions.""
That pushed down the stock market value of private education firms in the US, Hong Kong and mainland China.
Chinese authorities are also cracking down on a wide range of online services from food delivery apps to music streaming platforms.
On Monday, China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) issued new rules aimed at improving the employment conditions of delivery workers.
The SAMR called for delivery workers to be paid at least the minimum wage, have their workload eased, and be given better training.
Meituan, which runs one of China's biggest food delivery apps, saw its shares lose a record 17.6% on Tuesday in Hong Kong trade, on top of a 14% slide the previous day.
Shares in Tencent fell by another 9% on Tuesday in Hong Kong after China ordered the technology giant to end exclusive music licensing deals with major record labels around the world.
Regulators said the move was aimed at tackling the company's dominance of online music streaming in the country.
And earlier this year, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba accepted a record $2.8bn fine after an official investigation found that it had abused its market position for years."
other,"DOH sets price freeze for medicines, masks in Taal eruption-hit areas Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, January 15) — The Department of Health (DOH) has ordered a temporary stop in the increase in prices of medicines and medical supplies in areas affected by the Taal Volcano eruption. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III signed the department memorandum on Tuesday following confirmed reports of profiteering and hoarding. DOH set the lowest and maximum ceiling prices for emergency medicines, such as analgesics, antibiotics, antibacterial medicines, respiratory tract medicines, and anti-asthma medicines. Price freeze was also set for medical supplies, such as the highly in demand N95 face mask. DOH said the N95 mask should cost between P45-P105, while disposable surgical masks should cost a maximum of P8 per piece. The prices of N95 masks skyrocketed to P200 per piece a day after Taal Volcano started spewing smoke and ash on January 12."
Typhoon,"Thousands of Texans remain without power in the aftermath of Hurricane Hanna Sign up for The Brief, our daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news. Two days after Hurricane Hanna touched down in South Texas, thousands remained without power and communities were grappling with how to deal with the damage caused by flooding and strong winds. The storm, which made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane Saturday evening at Padre Island, packed sustained winds as high as 90 mph before weakening into a tropical storm early Sunday and moving into northern Mexico. It was the first hurricane of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season. Hanna unleashed more than 15 inches of rain in parts of South Texas, resulting in serious flash flooding, according to The Washington Post. Gov. Greg Abbott warned Texans on Sunday that there are continued threats of flash flooding even as rainfall slows, due to overflowing rivers. ""Any additional rainfall will exacerbate these threats, but the State of Texas is ready to respond and protect our fellow Texans,"" he said in a statement. The Federal Emergency Management Agency and President Donald Trump approved a federal emergency declaration in response to Hanna, allowing for some federal assistance and reimbursement for evacuation efforts and shelter support. Abbott previously issued a disaster declaration for 32 counties. Downed power lines and trees have caused road closures across South Texas. As of 1 p.m. Monday, American Electric Power Texas, one of the state's largest electric providers, reported more than 58,000 power outages in Corpus Christi, Laredo and the Rio Grande Valley. Before Hanna made landfall, Corpus Christi Mayor Joe McComb told The Associated Press that the city was prepared to deal with both the pandemic and the hurricane. ""Don't feel like since we've been fighting COVID for five months that we're out of energy or we're out of gas,” he said. “We're not. We can do these two things together and we're going to win both of them."""
Typhoon,"Earth’s strongest storm of 2013 so far, typhoon Utor, did a number on the northern Philippines.  Now it’s destined for southeastern China.
Utor, referred to as Labuyo in the Philippines, packed maximum sustained winds of 140 mph as it battered the northern island of Luzon.
The storm killed at least two people and destroyed 80 percent of the infrastructure in town of Casiguran near where it came inland according to reports.
In the hours prior to landfall, Utor’s intensity peaked at 150 mph, the equivalent of high-end category 4 hurricane and earning it “super typhoon” status (winds must be 150 mph for “super typhoon” classification), briefly.  That intensity bested any storm globally in 2013 writes Jeff Masters at wunderground.
“Earth’s previous most powerful tropical cyclone of 2013 was Typhoon Soulik, which reached Category 4 strength with 145 mph winds on July 10,” Masters says.
As it passed over Luzon, Utor dumped over 7.5 inches of rain in the cities of Dagupan and and Baguio notes AccuWeather.
The storm weakened markedly as it crossed over Luzon’s mountainous terrain, but is likely to regain some strength as it passes over the South China Sea.  As of 11 a.m., the Joint Typhoon Warning Center says its maximum sustained winds are around 100 mph and it forecasts gradual strengthening over the next two days:"
wildfires,"By Monday evening, the count showed 156 structures and almost 2,600 acres were subjected to the blowtorch of Texas Panhandle wind and wildfire Sunday and Monday just west and north of Fritch.
Earlier in the day, a Texas Department of Public Safety helicopter flew over the area for a survey of the charred landscape where some homes stood and others were ashes, and where there were reports of multiple exploding propane tanks, authorities said.
Revised estimates put the fire at only 65 percent contained, according to the Texas A&M Forest Service website. Forest Service Regional Coordinator Troy Ducheneaux said firefighters continued to deal with the fire his agency is calling the Double Diamond wildfire, going house-to-house in areas hit by the blaze to search for possible victims.
“We’ve got several areas we are addressing. We have broken the fire area into basically three different zones,” he said. “The (National) Park Service area is taking care of their area of responsibility, and we have broken up the Fritch area into two different divisions. We’ve got two different crews working in those areas; they are addressing those hot spots.
“The plan for later today and into (Tuesday) is to continue to improve contingency lines with dozers we have in place that are working the areas to ensure that we get this thing totally wrapped up.”
Earlier Monday, Fritch Police Chief Monte Leggett told some residents they probably won’t be able to return to their homes until Tuesday morning at the earliest.
“We’ve got crews still in the area. They are mopping it up at this point. We’ve got a lot of hot spots. You know how yuccas and mesquite are. They don’t want to go out,” Leggett said. “Lake Meredith Harbor is still in full evacuation. No one in, no one out. The majority of the destruction was in the Lake Meredith Harbor subdivision.”
About 2,100 people were evacuated from areas threatened by the fire overnight, Ducheneaux said.
They were housed in several shelters.
“It’s really bad,” said Danny Richards, Hutchinson County emergency management coordinator. “It looks like a war zone. It’s a disaster.”
The homes destroyed by the fire in Lake Meredith Harbor were a mix of mobile and traditional homes, Richards said."

The typhoon left a trail of damage in South Korea, killing 15 people and leaving almost two million temporarily without power.
A search is continuing off Jeju island for 10 Chinese fishermen still missing in the wake of the storm.
Two boats capsized early on Tuesday as the typhoon hit the island, which is south of the Korean peninsula.
South Korean coast guards managed to rescue 12 people and another six swam ashore. But five were killed and the whereabouts of the remaining 10 crew members is unknown.
Across the country 10 South Koreans were killed and another two injured, Yonhap news agency reported."
earthquake,"Turkey earthquake: Scores rescued from collapsed buildings, many still trapped More than 40 people have been pulled to safety after spending hours trapped under collapsed buildings following Friday's earthquake. Hopes are fading for dozens of others still imprisoned under concrete ruins. Emergency services in the eastern Turkish city of Elazig continued efforts on Sunday to rescue residents from collapsed buildings after a 6.8 magnitude earthquake shook the region and left at least 38 people dead. A total of 45 people had been pulled alive from under the rubble, officials said. But hopes of finding more survivors are fading as rescue teams struggle to comb through debris in freezing temperatures. Many people in Elazig province and nearby Malatya spent several hours, and some of them days, under piles of rubble before rescue crews were able to reach them. A 35-year-old woman named Ayse Yildiz was trapped for 28 hours under her apartment building in Elazig with her 2-year-old daughter, Yusra. According to Turkish media, rescue workers pulled the young girl from the wreckage at around 8:30 p.m. local time (1730 UTC) on Saturday, but it took nearly five more hours to rescue Yildiz, whose arm was trapped under a pile of rubble."
earthquake,"Earthquake in Turkey-Iran border region kills nine, injures more than 100 ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Nine people were killed and buildings collapsed across southeastern Turkey on Sunday when a magnitude 5.7 earthquake struck near the border with Iran, injuring more than a hundred in villages and towns in both countries, government officials said. In Turkey, three of the dead were children, and 50 people were injured, including nine critically, the health ministry said. The shallow tremor caused more than 1,000 buildings to collapse in Turkey, prompting a brief rescue effort to find those trapped under rubble. The quake damaged buildings some 90 km (56 miles) to the west in the Turkish city of Van, and to the east in dozens of villages in Iran, where state TV said 75 people were injured including six in hospital. There were several aftershocks including a larger tremor measuring 6.0 magnitude that stuck nearby 10 hours later. There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties from that quake, which was also fairly shallow and potentially dangerous. Crisscrossed by major fault lines, Iran and Turkey are among the most earthquake-prone countries in the world."
Typhoon,"The most powerful Atlantic Ocean storm in recorded history has left a trail of destruction across the Caribbean, killing at least 14 people and leaving thousands homeless.
Hurricane Irma, initially a Category Five storm, tore past Puerto Rico on Wednesday with winds speeds of 185mph, churning a path through Anguilla, St Barts, St Martin and the British Virgin Islands.
Before-and-after photos from some of the worst-affected areas show the extent of the damage.
Everything on the tiny island of Barbuda, which has a population of around 1,600, was razed to the ground.
“Barbuda is literally rubble. The entire housing stock was damaged. It is just a total devastation,” Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne told local news station ABS.
The hurricane is making its way towards Florida, which is on high alert and has ordered mandatory evacuations.
The Eden Rock Hotel on the Caribbean island of St Barthelemy, otherwise known as St Barts, was devastated by the storm.
The hotel, owned by Pippa Middleton's in-laws, was one of the first resorts built on the island in the 1950s."
Typhoon,"Gonzalo a hurricane risk to Caribbean (maybe US), Hanna a rainfall risk to Texas Two tropical storms, Gonzalo and Hanna, each of which has broken records as the earliest seventh and eighth named storms to form of the Atlantic tropical storm and hurricane season, are threatening impacts in the coming days. The 2020 Atlantic hurricane season is following true to forecasts for a very active season in terms of number of storms, as it is currently running ahead of records. Of course, these forecasts for high levels of activity do not necessarily mean high levels of insurance and reinsurance market losses, as it is landfalls that matter, in highly urbanised locations by strong storms and hurricanes. Tropical storm Gonzalo is forecast to become hurricane Gonzalo in the coming day or so, as it tracks towards the southern Caribbean windward islands. Gonzalo was the earliest seventh named storm of a tropical season and is now heading for the Caribbean with sustained winds of over 60mph and higher gusts. Expected to reach hurricane status, Gonzalo could then weaken slightly and head into the eastern Caribbean Sea, before then regaining strength on its passage northwest. Gonzalo is a relatively small tropical storm, with tropical-storm-force winds only extending outward up to 25 miles from the centre, which should save some islands from as strong a hit as it passes. Once through the Caribbean Gonzalo could enter the Gulf of Mexico and while there is significant uncertainty in precisely where the storm will track to, a U.S. Gulf Coast landfall is in the forecast for certain model runs. The below is taken from TropicalTidbits.com and shows a GFS model run for storm Gonzalo."
Typhoon,"Heavy rain and howling winds are lashing the northern Philippines and Taiwan as Typhoon Usagi goes through the Luzon Strait which divides them.
Villages have been evacuated, ferries suspended and flights cancelled.
Meteorologists say the storm is the most powerful this year and will bring a cumulative rainfall of 1,000mm (39in) as it heads towards China.
The authorities there have announced a red alert ahead of the expected arrival of the storm on Monday.
The US Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Centre said on Friday that Usagi was packing sustained winds of 240 km/h (150 mph), with gusts of up to 296 km/h (185mph), making it the equivalent of a strong category four Atlantic hurricane.
Taiwan is reported to have deployed more than 1,600 soldiers in ""high risk"" areas prone to flooding and landslides while placing 24,000 others on standby.
Authorities in the Philippines are reported to have evacuated nearly 250 people in the northern agricultural province of Tarlac, while ferries are restricted to their ports.
There are particular concerns about the impact of the storm on the Batanes islands in the north of the Philippines, with warnings that large trees could be uprooted, plantations flattened and power and communications severely disrupted by flash flooding, landslides and storm surges."
drought,"More than 44 per cent of India's areas were under various degrees of drought conditions (abnormally dry to exceptionally dry) as of June 10, 2019 — that is nearly 11 percentage point over a year ago, according to the Drought Early Warning System (DEWS).
Within this, ‘severe to exceptionally dry conditions’ prevailed in 17.33 per cent area, according to the real-time drought monitoring platform.
While just 0.65 per cent of area had ‘exceptionally dry’ conditions in June 2018, it has now jumped to 5.87 per cent, stated the latest data.
Further, the delay in southwest monsoons has worsened the drought index, the DEWS reported.
In the June 6 update, real-time platform recorded 43.02 per cent area under ‘abnormally to exceptionally dry’ conditions. However, the latest data showed an increase (44.17 per cent). 
Similarly, percentage of area under ‘extremely dry to exceptional dry’ increased from 10.83 to 11.22 per cent during the same period.
India has witnessed the second-driest pre-monsoon season in the last 65 years. The country received 99 millimeters (mm) rainfall between March and May — with 23 per cent below the normal rainfall during this time of the year —, showed the latest data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD).
The deficit is prevalent across the country with south India having a deficit of 47 per cent, followed by northwest India (30 per cent), central India (18 per cent), and east and northeast (14 per cent).
The month of June, which accounts for 18 per cent of rain, may end up with a deficit of 40 per cent in at least 66 districts across the country, warned Skymet Weather, a private weather forecasting agency.
The low rainfall would be difficult to make up for the deficit in coming months, it noted.
According to the IMD, there is also a possibility of weaker monsoon in July. It could be a great cause of worry, as the month is crucial and receives one third of the total monsoon rains in the country. 
The sluggish pace of the south west monsoon has compounded the severe dry spell. As a result, at least 30 sub-divisions are likely to experience ‘deficient’ and ‘largely deficient’ monsoon season, the IMD said.
Most of these are in Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, and the north eastern states. Only four sub-divisions in Karnataka, Gujarat, and Lakshadweep have witnessed ‘normal’ rainfall.
Low rainfall has also contributed to a downward trend in water levels in at least 71 of 91 reservoirs across India, a recent bulletin by the Central Water Commission (CWC), has showed.
The situation is particularly grim in the north-western region — in Gujarat and Maharashtra — and in the southern states of Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu, it said."
drought,"A potent combination of record-breaking heat and a lack of rain has led to the rapid development of drought across the southeastern United States and Tennessee and Ohio Valleys during September 2019. Coming off an extremely wet 2018 east of the Rockies, the fast onset of widespread extensive drought has been quite the climate whiplash for millions across the Southeast.  With warmer than average temperatures expected to continue and October being a generally dry month based on climatology, drought conditions are likely to continue and possibly expand and intensify over the next week.
The extent to which drought has overtaken the southeastern United States by the end of September would have been hard to explain to residents of the region just a month prior.  While a few localized areas in Georgia/Alabama were already mired in drought, the broader region extending into the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys was drought free. In fact, the twelve-month period (September 2018-August 2019) coming to an end was record wet. But then, while it continued to be hot, things turned incredibly dry.
The rapid onset and severity of the event qualified it as a “Flash drought.” Generally, droughts are caused by a lack of precipitation over an extended period of time. In contrast, a flash drought is preceded not just by a lack of rain, but also very high temperatures and/or lots of sunny days. Even if the dry period is not especially severe, the latter two can suck moisture from the ground quickly.
For operational purposes, NOAA National Weather Service’s Climate Prediction Center defines a flash drought as an event during which an area experiences degradation by two or more drought categories in a four week period, based on the U.S. Drought Monitor."
Typhoon,"The US Midwest will be hit with blizzards and gale-force winds this week, forecasters have said, as a powerful storm threatens to trigger more flooding in the region.
High spring temperatures are today expected to give way to heavy snow and life-threatening conditions across a swath of the central US.
Patrick Burke, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service (NWS), warned that the storm could cause widespread power outages and road closures.
“This is potentially a life-threatening storm,” he told Reuters. “It’s slow moving. It won’t push farther east until Friday.”
The storm has already sparked flood evacuations in Oregon and caused flooding in Washington state.
Some areas of western Minnesota and southeast South Dakota are likely to experience up to 30 inches snow.
The same region is still recovering from last month’s ‘bomb cyclone’ which brought deadly flooding and blizzards, causing billions of dollars in damage.
The NWS said that the coming storm is likely to exacerbate flooding along the Missouri River in areas where dozens of levees were breached in March.
The storm is expected to weaken and push off into the Great Lakes area and northern Michigan on Friday, bringing more rain and snow, forecasters said."
wildfires,"The number of fires in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest jumped 28% in July from a year ago, official data showed on Saturday, as some environmentalists warned a jump this week could signal a repeat of last year’s surging destruction of the world’s largest rainforest.
Brazil’s space research agency Inpe recorded 6,803 fires in the Amazon last month, up from 5,318 in July 2019.
Although that is a three-year high for July, the figure pales in comparison to last year’s peak of 30,900 fires in August _ a nine-year high for that month.
Still, environmental groups say there are worrying signs of what may come, with the final days of the month showing a sharp spike. More than 1,000 fires were registered on July 30, the highest number for a single day in July since 2005, according to an analysis by advocacy group Greenpeace Brasil.
“It’s a terrible sign,” said Ane Alencar, science director at Brazil’s Amazon Environmental Research Institute (IPAM). “We can expect that August will already be a difficult month and September will be worse yet.”Environmental advocates blame right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro for emboldening illegal loggers, miners and land speculators to destroy the forest with his vision of economic development for the region. Bolsonaro defends his plans to introduce mining and farming in protected reserves as a way to lift the region out of poverty.
This year, the president authorized a military deployment from May to November to combat deforestation and forest fires. He has also banned setting fires in the region for 120 days.
In 2019, Brazil instituted the same temporary policies later in the year, only after fires in the Amazon provoked global outcry in August.
Scientists say the rainforest is a vital defense against climate warming because it absorbs greenhouse gases.
Non-government organization Amazon Conservation says it has tracked 62 major fires for the year as of July 30. Many of those came after July 15, when the fire ban went into affect, indicating it has not been entirely effective, said Matt Finer, who leads the NGO’s fire tracking project.
The overwhelming majority of large fires, where elevated levels of aerosols in the smoke indicate large amounts of burning biomass, happened in recently deforested areas, with none found in virgin forest, Finer said."
earthquake,"An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.9 has shaken southern Peru, leaving nearly two dozen people injured.
The U.S. Geological Survey says Friday's quake was centered 52 kilometers from the coastal city of Ica and was registered at a depth of 15 kilometers.
The Reuters news agency reports the quake shook buildings in Peru's capital, Lima. Officials in Ica say 20 people have been treated at the hospital. Their injuries have been described as non life-threatening.
In 2007, a massive 8.0-magnitude earthquake along Peru's central coast killed at least 540 people and left thousands homeless.  Peru lies near the boundary of two tectonic plates, making the region vulnerable to earthquakes."
earthquake,"The biggest earthquake to hit Japan in 140 years struck the northeast coast on Friday, triggering a 10-meter tsunami that swept away everything in its path, including houses, cars and farm buildings on fire, media and witnesses said.
At least one person was killed in Fukushima prefecture, north of Tokyo where four million homes were without power. The 8.9 magnitude quake caused many injuries, public broadcaster NHK said, sparked fires and the wall of water, prompting warnings to people to move to higher ground in coastal areas.
The Philippines, Taiwan and Indonesia all issued tsunami alerts, reviving memories of the giant tsunami which struck Asia in 2004. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued alerts for countries as far away as Colombia and Peru.
There were several strong aftershocks. In the capital Tokyo, buildings shook violently. An oil refinery near Tokyo was on fire, with dozens of storage tanks under threat."
drought,"The mighty Rio Grande is looking less mighty as U.S. forecasters predict spring flows will be less than half of average — or worse — and that signals potential trouble for the already stressed waterway.
One of the longest rivers in North America, the Rio Grande delivers drinking water and irrigation supplies to millions of people from southern Colorado into Texas and Mexico under a decades-old water-sharing agreement. With more dry years than wet ones over the last two decades, how much water ends up flowing downstream has been a point of contention among the states.
As New Mexico and Texas battle over their shares before the U.S. Supreme Court, forecasters with the federal government’s Natural Resources Conservation Service say river and stream flows across New Mexico have dropped noticeably following a somewhat dry March.
The models show drought is expected to keep its hold over the mountains along the New Mexico-Colorado border that feed the Rio Grande, while California, Nevada and other southwestern states aren’t likely to see a reprieve from dry conditions through June."

Typhoon,"At least 13 people were killed and over 50 missing, with nearly 20,000 people ordered to evacuate and hundreds of flights cancelled as Typhoon Wipha pummelled Japan’s Pacific coast on Wednesday, leaving piles of wreckage on one small island but largely sparing the capital Tokyo.
Operators of the wrecked Fukushima nuclear power plant north of Tokyo pumped rainwater out of protective containers at the base of some 1,000 tanks storing radioactive water, and were taking other precautions, as the typhoon brushed past Tokyo and moved up the coastline.
Television footage showed roads clogged with heaps of wreckage and houses with gaping holes.
“I heard a crackling sound and then the trees on the hillside all fell over,” a woman on Oshima island told NHK national television. “Then mud slid as far as the house.”
The storm brought hurricane-force winds and drenching rain to the metropolis of 30 million people at the peak of the morning rush hour, halting some train services. Other trains operated at partial capacity.
The storm, which was picking up speed as it moved north, was 170 km (105 miles) south of the city of Miyako and moving north northeast at 75 kph (47 mph) at 11am (0200 GMT), according to the Japan Meteorological Agency’s website.
It carried sustained winds at its centre of 126 kph (78 mph) and gusts up to 180 kph (112 mph) and was expected to weaken into a tropical depression later on Wednesday.
Over 500 flights at Tokyo’s Haneda and Narita airports were cancelled, and several subway lines in the city stopped running due to the high winds. Thousands of schools closed as a precaution.
The typhoon passed close to the crippled Fukushima plant, 220 km (130 miles) north of Tokyo, shortly before noon.
The operator of the plant, Tokyo Electric Power Corp , which has been struggling to contain radioactive leaks, said it would cancel all offshore work and would decide whether to continue work onshore after assessing the weather.
It was pumping out rainwater at the tanks storing radioactive water, a by-product of a jerry-rigged cooling system designed to control reactors wrecked in a 2011 earthquake and tsunami.
The rainwater will be pumped into an empty tank, checked for radioactivity and, if uncontaminated, released into the sea, the company said.
Nissan Motor Co cancelled the Wednesday morning shift at its Oppama and Yokohama plants south of Tokyo and said it was waiting to decide what to do about later shifts. Oppama makes the all-electric Leaf and other models.
Typhoon Wipha is the strongest storm to approach eastern Japan since October 2004. The cyclone that year triggered floods and landslides that killed almost 100 people, forced thousands from their homes and caused billions of dollars in damage."
other,"‘Huge’ explosion rocks Caribbean island as volcano keeps erupting KINGSTOWN, St. Vincent — La Soufriere volcano fired an enormous amount of ash and hot gas early Monday in the biggest explosive eruption yet since volcanic activity began on the eastern Caribbean island of St. Vincent late last week, with officials worried about the lives of those who refused to evacuate. Experts called it a “huge explosion” that generated pyroclastic flows down the volcano’s south and southwest flanks. “It’s destroying everything in its path,” Erouscilla Joseph, director of the University of the West Indies’ Seismic Research Center, told the Associated Press. “Anybody who would have not heeded the evacuation, they need to get out immediately.”"
wildfires,"Some people who had fled their homes have now been able to return, although others spent the night in emergency evacuation centres or with relatives.
A 78-year-old man was found dead and five others were hurt, two seriously, in the fires.
Thousands of people were evacuated, including some 300 British expats.
The UK Consulate in Malaga said they had all now left the evacuation centre and were staying with friends or had returned to their homes.
The authorities say the cause of the fires will be investigated, and are not ruling out that they could have been started deliberately.
Hundreds of firefighters, backed up by emergency military personnel and 31 planes and helicopters, continue to battle a huge blaze near Marbella, famous for its up-market hotels and villas and a favourite haunt of wealthy foreigners.
Spanish media reported that the fires had been brought under control, but fire service officials told the BBC that some pockets were still causing problems."
Typhoon,"Inhabitants of the Korean peninsula are cleaning up after one powerful typhoon and preparing for another that could be particularly damaging to North Korea, which is still recovering from earlier floods.
The first storm, typhoon Bolaven, left at least 12 people dead in South Korea, including eight fishermen killed in wrecks off the southern coast. The extent of the damage in North Korea, which was hit late on Tuesday and early on Wednesday, was not completely clear, although state media reported that the storm knocked out power, submerged roads and houses and ruined farmland.
Typhoon Tembin was expected to reach South Korea on Thursday, with its outer bands hitting North Korea later in the day.
Tembin is expected to weaken as it reaches North Korea. Heavy rain, however, often means catastrophe in the north because of poor drainage, deforestation and decrepit infrastructure. The north's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said some areas of Hwanghae and Kangwon provinces would receive up to 70mm (2.8in) of rain on Thursday and Friday."
Typhoon,"CloudSat overpassed Typhoon Utor in the West Pacific on August 11, 2013 at 0518 UTC, this storm contained estimated maximum strength winds of 115 knots (132 mph) and minimum pressure of 937mb.
The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA's Aqua satellite captured the infrared (IR) image taken a few minutes before the CloudSat overpass (the blue line A-> B on Figures 1, 2 and 3). CloudSat overpassed about 10km to the east of the center of the storm revealing the structure of the eye and eye wall. This is one a handful of cases where CloudSat has directly intersected the eye of a storm of this intensity and size. The strength of Utor's at this time is equivalent to category 4 strength hurricane.
This overpass reveals many unique features of a well defined and intense Typhoon (tropical cyclone) - outward sloping eye and eyewall, rainband areas, moats and areas of high reflectivity (greater than 30dBZ). Heavy precipitation is distinuguished by the attenuation of the radar (lack of signal) in the lowest 5 km's (up to almost 10 km's in the eyewall area) of the CloudSat swath. The CloudSat overpasses reveals large amounts of liquid and ice water spread throughout the storm and also distinguishes rainbands areas separated by moats (cloud free areas) beneath the cirrus canopy."
wildfires,"Six months after 19 firefighters lost their lives battling the Yarnell Hill wildfire near Prescott, Ariz., The Weather Channel investigated the larger problem of U.S. wildfires. In an article and original documentary titled ""America Burning: The Yarnell Hill Tradegy and the Nation's Wildfire Crisis,"" journalist Neil Katz, along with executive producer Greg Gilderman and producer Shawn Efran of Efran Films, interview surviving family members and the sole surviving firefighter.
They also interview Steve Pyne, ASU School of Life Sciences professor and world renowned fire expert. Pyne discusses how changes in both climate and land use have dramatically affected the health of U.S. forests. 
In a press release, The Weather Channel states that nearly 400 wildland firefighters have died in the past 20 years. Neil Katz, vice-president of content at The Weather Company, says the organization wants to help bring awareness to the serious national problem of wildfires, and to help keep people safe."
wildfires,"The BC Wildfire Service is responding to a three-hectare wildfire near Ingram Creek, about five kilometres north of the village of Midway. No structures are immediately threatened at this time.
Twenty-five firefighters, three helicopters and an airtanker group are working on this incident. A water tender is also on site and a fire guard is being established around the perimeter of the fire.
Smoke is visible from Midway, Greenwood and along Highway 3. It’s suspected that this fire was caused by lightning.
The number of phone reports received from the public allowed the Southeast Fire Centre to respond to this fire quickly and efficiently. The BC Wildfire Service would like to thank the public for their continued assistance in reporting wildfires.
The current fire danger rating in the Southeast Fire Centre is “moderate” or “high”, with some pockets rated “extreme” near Midway, Grand Forks, Kaslo and Revelstoke."
earthquake,"Death toll soars to 36 in eastern Turkey earthquake ISTANBUL, Jan. 26 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from a strong earthquake that rocked eastern Turkey on Friday has risen to 36, with 1,607 people injured, the Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) reported on Sunday. A total of 45 people were rescued from ruins, and search and rescue operations are still going on in the debris of one building at the city center, the AFAD said in an updated statement. The earthquake occurred at 8:55 p.m. local time (1755 GMT) in the province of Elazig at a depth of 6.75 km and was followed by 788 aftershocks, according to the statement. The analysis of a total of 1,521 constructions in both Elazig and the nearby province of Malatya by experts revealed that at least 76 buildings were fully wrecked, and 645 others were severely damaged, the AFAD added. Earlier in the day, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the problems were mostly in the villages of Elazig. ""We will detect the scope of the damage there and launch the construction works quickly,"" he told reporters in Istanbul before departing for Algeria. The AFAD statement also said that some 10,000 tents suitable for families were shipped to the region, and more than 4,200 of them were installed in line with the demand in the field. The agency also shared a couple of bank details on its website for those citizens who want to donate money for the earthquake survivors."
other,"Why the New Zealand volcano eruption caught the world by surprise The explosive event was “the actual worst-case scenario,” geologists report. On Monday, at 2:11 p.m. local time, an explosive eruption rocked White Island, a small volcanic isle in New Zealand’s Bay of Plenty. A series of violent blasts rang out, flinging ash 12,000 feet into the sky and showering the volcano’s floor with hot debris, before everything fell silent a handful of minutes later. It quickly became apparent that lives were lost. A number of tourists were on the island at the time, several of whom were right next to the volcano’s active vent. At the time of writing, five deaths have been officially recorded, with several more people still unaccounted for. Recent reconnaissance flights over the island, also known by its Māori name Whakaari, have found no signs of life."
Typhoon,"Tropical Storm Cristobal takes aims at Gulf Coast, Louisiana: Landfall expected Sunday MONROE, La. _ Tropical Storm Cristobal is expected to slowly strengthen Saturday night, moving toward a likely landfall on the Gulf Coast Sunday. Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency Saturday. Cristobal was upgraded from a tropical depression to a tropical storm over Mexico on Tuesday, becoming the third named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season. The National Hurricane Center said Cristobal's maximum sustained winds had strengthened to 50 mph Saturday evening. The storm was centered about 235 miles south of the mouth of the Mississippi River. Cristobal is not expected to become a hurricane, which typically have wind speeds of 75 mph. “The tropical storm-force winds extend outward at least 24 miles from the center,” meteorologist Dennis Feltgen said. “That's a big storm.” Landfall and tropical cyclones also trigger the possibility of tornadoes, Dennis cautioned. Heavy rainfall is expected this weekend and early next week in areas of the Mid-South and Gulf Coast from East Texas to Florida, the National Hurricane Center said. Flooding is predicted to reach as high as five feet above ground level along the mouth of the Mississippi River and Ocean Springs, up to four feet along the Morgan City shoreline and between one and three feet along the rest of the gulf. “We put our disaster teams and 70 mobile feeding units on standby,” Salvation Army Southern Territory Disaster Coordinator Jeff Jellets said. “We’re staying in close coordination with local officials, monitoring the storm path and, once the storm makes landfall, getting damage assessments.”"
earthquake,"7.5M Earthquake Jolts Alaska: Scientists Warn Imminent 'Mega-Tsunami' Here Within a Year Due to Melting Ice The Alaska Peninsula was hit by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Monday afternoon, October 19, triggering a tsunami warning in the region. But the threat is not over. Scientists said the melting glaciers in Alaska region could unleash a 'mega-tsunami,' with a destructive high wall of water. As per the scientists, the glacier retreat in Prince William Sound—a narrow sea channel on the south coast of the U.S. state of Alaska—is now destabilizing mountain slopes and a massive tsunami could appear as early as 2021. A group of experts in an open letter to Alaskan authorities said that collapsing mountain slopes in Alaska caused 633 feet high waves in 2015. The researchers also noted that in west Greenland, a landslide in June 2017 produced a tsunami that killed four people and destroyed a large portion of the town of Nuugaatsiaq. According to the findings, the tsunami could impact areas frequently visited by tourists, fishing vessels, and hunters. The team of scientists believes that there is a possibility that this landslide-led tsunami ""will happen within the next year, and likely within 20 years."""
earthquake,"Magnitude 4.9 earthquake strikes near Yerevan, Armenia An earthquake of magnitude 4.9 occurred only 7 minutes ago 11 km south of Yerevan, Armenia, the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) reported. The quake hit at a very shallow depth of 0 km beneath the epicenter near Yerevan, Armenia, early afternoon on Saturday 13 February 2021 at 3:29 pm local time. The exact magnitude, epicenter, and depth of the quake might be revised within the next few hours or minutes as seismologists review data and refine their calculations, or as other agencies issue their report. Our monitoring service identified a second report from the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) which listed the quake at magnitude 4.6. Based on the preliminary seismic data, the quake should have been widely felt by almost everyone in the area of the epicenter. It might have caused light to moderate damage. Moderate shaking probably occurred in Tokhanshalu (pop. 18,900) located 7 km from the epicenter. In Yerevan (pop. 1,093,500) located 11 km from the epicenter, Artashat (pop. 20,600) 14 km away, Vagharshapat (pop. 46,500) 20 km away, Ejmiatsin (pop. 49,500) 20 km away, Abovyan (pop. 35,700) 24 km away, Ashtarak (pop. 18,800) 27 km away, and Ararat (pop. 28,800) 33 km away, the quake should have been felt as light shaking. Weak shaking might have been felt in Gyumri (pop. 148,400) located 97 km from the epicenter. VolcanoDiscovery will automatically update magnitude and depth if these change and follow up if other significant news about the quake become available. If you’re in the area, please send us your experience through our reporting mechanism, either online or via our mobile app. This will help us provide more first-hand updates to anyone around the globe who wants to know more about this quake."
drought,"The latest famine in Somalia has put a spotlight on the urgent need to develop national and regional drought policies, according to the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, which are jointly leading the international action to address the growing impact of droughts.
Drought is expected to continue in hard-hit southern Somalia during August and September, as well as parts of Ethiopia, Djibouti and Kenya, according to the latest WMO Climate Outlook Forum for the region, which provides regional climate forecasts. The IGAD Climate Prediction and Applications Centre (ICPAC) already called for preparedness for an ongoing long period of drought over parts of the equatorial region in its climate update for the Greater Horn of Africa on 15 January 2011.
Droughts have become more common over the past two decades. This is consistent with reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, stating that the world has become more drought-prone over the last 25 years, and will see an increased frequency of droughts in the future.
""Droughts do not happen overnight,"" said Luc Gnacadja, Executive Secretary of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), responding to the declaration of famine by the United Nations earlier this month. ""The UNCCD joins the calls on the international community to respond urgently to this crisis. At the same time, we stress the need for effective, long-term solutions to the root causes of famine in drought-prone regions, such as implementation of drought management systems and measures to stop desertification, which means land degradation in drylands.""
""We are moving forward quickly to provide integrated drought information to help decision-makers deal with drought, such as the one underway right now in East Africa,"" said Michel Jarraud, Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization. ""Drought is a serious and growing problem in many countries. Adaptation to drought, desertification and climate change urgently needs to be mainstreamed in national development policies.""
Mr Gnacadja visited Mr Jarraud at WMO earlier this month to discuss cooperation between the two organizations, following the UN declaration of famine for two provinces in southern Somalia on 13 July 2011. The two organizations have a long-standing partnership. Most recently they have championed the use of the Standard Precipitation Index, as a universal meteorological drought index to improve monitoring and climate risk management among countries."
earthquake,"A series of massive earthquakes have struck north-east Japan, unleashing a 10-metre tsunami that swept buildings, vehicles, crops and debris across swaths of farmland.
The first 8.9 magnitude shock is said to be the biggest to have hit Japan in 140 years, rocking buildings 235 miles (380km) away in Tokyo and sparking fires.
At least five people are known to have died, but amid widespread reports of landslides, floods, collapsed buildings and fires, the death toll is expected to rise.
The quake hit at 2.46pm (5.45am GMT), about 6 miles below sea level and 78 miles off the east coast. It was swiftly followed by five powerful aftershocks of up to 7.1 magnitude. In Tokyo people screamed and grabbed each other's hands as the quake struck. The shock was so powerful it was felt as far away as Beijing."
earthquake,"In a land of people used to earthquakes, everyone is saying this one, which hit at 14:46 local time, is the strongest they’ve ever felt-and that’s in Tokyo, some 400 kilometers southwest from the epicenter.
Scientists are calling it the biggest earthquake in Japan’s tremor-filled history. Preliminary estimates from the USGS put the magnitude at 7.9, which have since grown to 8.9. Estimates of the depth range from 10-20 kilometres. This earthquake was 178 times as powerful as the 1995 Hanshin/Kobe earthquake.
Miyagi prefecture was pummeled the hardest. There Japan’s earthquake intensity scale, which measures the amount of shaking at ground level, recorded a 7, the highest level. More than 20 deaths have been reported.
Tsunamis reaching 10 metres have hit the area and 3 metres tsunami are reported down all the way down the coast far past Tokyo.
Panic gripped Tokyo as bookshelves and installations in offices fell, people poured into the streets and more than a dozen buildings reported fire sending smoke billowing into the sky.
Trains are stopped as far down as Shizuoka, far south of Tokyo. Some phone lines are dead, but my internet is working. I’m writing minutes after the earthquake, stuck on a train that screeched to a halt and then bounced on the tracks"

The eruption, although labelled “short-lived”, “not particularly big” and “almost like a throat clearing kind of eruption” by New Zealand’s geoscience agency GNS Science, has killed at least five and injured several others. Amid rescue efforts, here is a look at the volcanic island located 50km from the east coast of North Island."
drought,"Major cities across Turkey face running out of water in the next few months, with warnings Istanbul has less than 45 days of water left.
Poor rainfall has led to the country’s most severe drought in a decade and left the megacity of 17 million people with critically low levels of water, according to Turkey’s chamber of chemical engineers. The Ankara mayor, Mansur Yava?, said earlier this month the capital had another 110 days’ worth in dams and reservoirs.
?zmir and Bursa, Turkey’s next two biggest cities, are also struggling, with dams that are about 36% and 24% full respectively, and farmers in wheat-producing areas such as the Konya plain and Edirne province on the border with Greece and Bulgaria are warning of crop failure.
The acute lack of rainfall in the second half of 2020 _ approaching 50% year on year for November _ led the religious affairs directorate to instruct imams and their congregations to pray for rain last month.
Turkey is a “water stressed” country, with just 1,346 cubic metres of water per capita per year, and has faced several droughts since the 1980s due to a combination of population growth, industrialisation, urban sprawl and climate change.
“Instead of focusing on measures to keep water demand under control, Turkey insists on expanding its water supply through building more dams  Turkey has built hundreds of dams in the last two decades,” said Dr Akgün ?lhan, a water management expert at the Istanbul Policy Center.
“The warning signs have been there for decades but not much has been done in practice.”
Turkey has long prioritised economic growth over environmental concerns and remains the only G20 country apart from the US yet to ratify the 2015 Paris agreement."
