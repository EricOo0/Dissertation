earthquake,"Major magnitude 7.7 earthquake - Southeast of Loyalty Islands, New Caledonia, on Wednesday, 10 February 2021 at 13:20 (GMT) - information Small tsunami observed Given the magnitude and relative shallow depth of the quake, a tsunami alert had been issued for coastal areas including New Zealand, New Caledonia, Vanuatu and other islands in the area. In fact, the quake triggered a small tsunami, which reached maximum wave heights of less than a meter: In Lenakel (Vanuatu), 0.78 m waves above tide were measured, 75 cm on the Great Barrier Island (New Zealand), 48 cm at Kingston Norfolk Island, and 10-20 cm in various coastal locations of New Caledonia. There are no reports of damages."
earthquake,"Sand Point’s docks and road damaged in 7.8 quake A magnitude-7.8 Aleutian earthquake late Tuesday night prompted tsunami warnings in communities across coastal Alaska, from Homer to Unalaska.  Sand Point is a fishing community of about a thousand people, located about 550 miles southwest of Anchorage in the eastern portion of the Aleutian Chain. Earthquake damage closed both its city docks, which it uses to land the M/V Tustumena ferry and freight boats, and damaged the road to the harbor. The floor sank in a warehouse on Sand Point’s old dock, creating a large crack across the length of the cement, according to City Administrator Jordan Keeler. He said a team of engineers will inspect the damage in the next week or so, and he’s confident that it looks worse than it actually is.  “We have two docks total and they are both closed, effective immediately until we can get an inspection to verify the extent of the damage to both the new dock and the old dock,” Keeler said.  In the meantime, closing down the docks could mean that freight shipments will be cancelled until they reopen. That could impact the island community’s ability to get fresh food, he added."
Typhoon,"Typhoon Bolaven is forecast to be moving towards the Korean Peninsula and is likely to move west of Seoul.
At least four people were injured, but reported wind speeds on Okinawa and nearby Amami were lower than forecast.
About 57,000 people on the islands were left without power, Japanese media reported.
Residents had been told to stay at home and protect themselves against the strong winds and heavy rain.
Forecasters had predicted slow-moving Typhoon Bolaven could be the strongest storm to hit the area in over 50 years.
Public broadcaster NHK said gusts could overturn cars, while waves around the island could reach 12m (40ft).
Japan's meteorological agency estimated wind speeds near the storm's centre at around 180km/h (112 mph), with extremely strong gusts reaching 252 km/h.
But NHK reported early Monday morning that the strongest gusts measured on the islands - on Amami, north of Okinawa - reached just 140km/h, according to the AP news agency."

A volcanic eruption in New Zealand had claimed a life and left at least 27 people reported missing. Known as the country's most active volcano, Whakaari has erupted on Monday early afternoon, sending a huge cloud of ash and affecting at least 50 island visitors. An American tourist, Michael Schade, told BBC that he was at the crater just a few minutes before the eruption. Then, when he was riding on a boat that was leaving the island after the morning tour ended, someone pointed the ash piling up from the volcano. He said it was an experience that will be ""hard to believe."" But the boat he was in returned to the island and rescued as many people as they can. One of them, which his mom tended to, is among to those who are in critical condition. A touring party of at least 38 people from the Ovation of the Seas also has not yet returned, according to Kevin O'Sullivan, the chief executive officer of the New Zealand Cruise Association."
wildfires,"SYDNEY (BLOOMBERG) - Australia is in the grip of deadly wildfires burning across the country, triggering an emotive debate about the impact of climate change in the world's driest-inhabited continent. The unprecedented scale of the crisis, and images of terrified tourists sheltering on beaches from the inferno, have shocked many Australians.
With summer only just beginning and the nation affected by a prolonged drought, the authorities fear the death toll will continue to mount as more homes and land are destroyed. Here are some key details of the crisis:
How many people have died?
Since the fire season began months ago during the southern hemisphere winter, 23 people have died. With six people missing in Victoria state, the authorities fear the death toll will rise. Among the fatalities are volunteer firefighters, including a young man who died when his 10-tonne truck was flipped over in what officials have described as a ""fire tornado"". Australia's worst wildfires came in 2009 when the Black Saturday blazes left 180 people dead."
earthquake,"Turkey earthquake death toll hits 85, dog rescued 65 hours after quake ISTANBUL - Turkish rescue workers on Monday pulled out a dog from under the debris of a building, some 65 hours after an earthquake in Turkey's Izmir that has killed at least 85 people. The Disaster and Emergency Management Authority of Turkey (AFAD) said the dog ""Ares"" was rescued from the rubble of an apartment building. Ares was reported to be exhausted but in good condition. The dog was handed over to its owner Gizem Ileri, who was pulled out from the rubble 10 hours after the tremor. The 6.6-magnitude quake hit the Aegean Sea off the Seferihisar district of Izmir on Friday. Death toll in the earthquake has risen to 85, the AFAD said in the latest statement, adding that a total of 994 people were wounded in the tremor."
Typhoon,"Eight months after Hurricane Laura devastated southwest Louisiana, the state transportation department has finished removing storm debris from state roadways.
The Department of Transportation and Development said it wrapped up removal of 1.4 million cubic yards of debris Tuesday in Calcasieu Parish, one of the hardest hit areas from Laura in August and the follow-up blow of Hurricane Delta in October.
The cleanup of debris from the 2020 storms on state roadways in other parishes already had been completed.
The transportation department said contractors statewide removed 3.3 million cubic yards of hurricane debris. Two-thirds of that was cleaned up in the southwestern Louisiana parishes of Allen, Beauregard, Calcasieu, Cameron and Jefferson Davis."
earthquake,"Turkey earthquake: At least 31 dead as buildings collapse At least 31 people have been killed and more than 1,600 injured in a powerful earthquake in eastern Turkey. The magnitude-6.8 quake centred on the town of Sivrice in Elazig province caused buildings to collapse and sent residents rushing into the street. Forty-five people have been rescued so far, with more than 20 feared to remain trapped, officials say. Earthquakes are common in Turkey - about 17,000 people died in a quake in the western city of Izmit in 1999. Friday's quake struck at about 20:55 local time (17:55 GMT). Tremors were also felt in neighbouring Syria, Lebanon and Iran. More than 400 aftershocks were recorded, Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (Afad) said. Rescue teams worked through the night, using their hands, drills and diggers to try to find people in the rubble of fallen buildings. They also brought beds and tents for those displaced, and warned residents against returning to damaged buildings because of the danger of aftershocks. Afad said that most of the casualties were in Elazig province, and deaths were also reported in the neighbouring province of Malatya. Some 1,607 people were injured by the earthquake, according to the latest count."

There are 16 confirmed fatalities, with many of the injured still in critical condition There are 16 confirmed victims of the fatal eruption on White Island/Whakaari _ 12 Australians, two Australian permanent residents, one American and one New Zealander. Two people _ Australian teenager Winona Langford and New Zealand guide Hayden Marshall-Inman, 40 _ are still missing despite repeated ground and sea searches. Their bodies are believed to be in the water, police have said. There were 47 people on the island at the time of the eruption, 38 of them from the cruise liner Ovation of the Seas. Those present comprised of 24 people from Australia, nine from the US, two Britons, four Germans, five New Zealanders, two people from China and one from Malaysia. As of Tuesday, there were 14 patients being cared for in four burns units around New Zealand. In the days after the blast, 13 Australians were repatriated to hospitals in their home country, one of whom was confirmed by police to have died at Concord hospital in Sydney. The Australian man’s name was not released at the request of the family."
wildfires,"Dozens of wildfires raging in rain-starved Texas are now reported to have engulfed more than 1,000 homes.
The biggest of the blazes - 16 miles (26km) wide - in rural Bastrop County, is burning out of control for a third day, having destroyed 600 homes.
Two people were reported to have died in the Bastrop blaze, a local sheriff said, amid hopes for calmer winds to help control the fires.
Texas has been suffering its worst drought since the 1950s.

Speaking at a news conference on Tuesday, Texas Governor Rick Perry said more than 100,000 acres (40,470ha) had been scorched by at least 57 wildfires in Texas over the past week.
More than 1,000 homes had been burned over the past week, added Texas emergency management chief Nim Kidd.
On Monday, officials said about 500 homes had been destroyed."
Typhoon,"Here’s an astonishing statistic: Typhoon Wipha dumped 33 inches (850 mm) of rain in 24 hours on Oshima Island, 75 miles south of Tokyo.
It is the greatest rainstorm to occur on Oshima, populated by 8,200 people, since records began in 1991 reports the AP. It also twice the entire average rainfall for the month of October, notes the Wall Street Journal.
Incredibly, 17 inches (426 mm) fell in 4 hours and nearly 5 inches in one hour.
Those are unfathomable rainfall rates and, thus, it is no surprise they led to destructive mudslides and fatalities.
At least 17 people are dead from the typhoon and 45 to 50 missing according to wire reports. 16 of the 17 casualties occurred on Oshima.
283 homes were damaged or destroyed on Oshima, the AP says.
“The storm sent large volumes of earth down mountainsides and caused rivers to burst their banks,” reports the BBC. “Television footage showed the remains of wooden homes buried in mud and covered in debris.”"
Typhoon,"Edouard _ Atlantic Ocean July 07, 2020 _ Edouard Now Post-Tropical in NASA-NOAA Satellite Imagery When NASA-NOAA’s Suomi NPP satellite passed over the western North Atlantic Ocean on July 6, it provided forecasters with a visible image of Edouard after it transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) defines a post-tropical cyclone as a former tropical cyclone. This generic term describes a cyclone that no longer possesses sufficient tropical characteristics to be considered a tropical cyclone. Post-tropical cyclones can continue carrying heavy rains and high winds. Two classes of post-tropical cyclones include extratropical and remnant lows. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument aboard Suomi NPP provided a visible image that showed Edouard’s center of circulation has merged with a frontal boundary. Therefore, the system was classified as extratropical."

Typhoon,"Short-lived Tropical Storm Bertha offers lessons for Florida As quickly as Bertha raised eyebrows Wednesday it’s already beginning to fade from memory, but the lesson it provides certainly doesn’t. What started as a tropical wave Sunday over Florida with little hope of development, Bertha snapped into a tropical storm just two days later and brought flash flood warnings throughout South Carolina. Bertha didn’t amount to much with its strongest gusts just under 60 mph and bringing about 5 inches of rain to portions of the Charleston area, according to the National Weather Service. Still, the NASCAR-like development of Bertha is a problem for Floridians and other state residents near the tropics as quick rapid maturity is a phenomenon that poses a threat to home owners who let their guard down. Luckily that was not the case for South Carolina residents and its emergency management directors."

drought,"evere to extreme drought is expected to hit countries in the lower Mekong basin from now until January 2020, warns the Mekong River Commission. Thailand and Cambodia would be hardest hit compared to Lao PDR and Viet Nam.    
Preliminary analysis of MRC’s data has shown that the draught is caused by insufficient rainfall during the wet season with a delayed arrival and earlier departure of the monsoon rain and an El Nino event that has created an abnormally high temperature and high evapotranspiration. 
During a normal year, the monsoon rain usually starts in late May and ends in October. But this year, it began almost two weeks late and departed about three weeks earlier. 
“This year’s prolonged dry weather condition can possibly adversely impact agricultural and crop production. The issue of water shortages for consumption could also come into play as the drought persists,” said Dr. Lam Hung Son, the MRC Secretariat’s Head of Regional Flood and Drought Management Center, who led the analysis.  
Using a three-month timeframe, the analysis looked at both the probability and degree of drought and rainfall occurrences compared with historical data called the standardized precipitation index (SPI), and the degree of dryness of the top soil layer known as the combined drought index (CDI) in the four MRC Member States: Lao PDR, Cambodia, Thailand and VietNam."

Up to 2,000 firefighters are battling the flames.
The blaze is one of some three dozen large fires burning in the drought-hit western US states, authorities say.
Lightning storms hitting parched grass, brush and timber have brought an unusually early start to the fire season.
On Tuesday, Gov Jerry Brown announced that National Guard troops would be helping with firefighting efforts, already bolstered by federal funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Firefighters assessing the destruction from the Manton blaze, known as the Ponderosa Fire, have concluded that some 50 buildings - many residential - had been destroyed.
""There is a good chance that number [of destroyed buildings] will go up, because they haven't been able to get into the whole area affected by the fire,"" Mike Witesman, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said.
The firefighters are now focused on tackling the blaze - now said to be 40% contained - as it threatens some 3,500 homes in the small communities of Shingleton, Manton and Viola."
earthquake,"Magnitude 7.0 Earthquake Hits Turkey and Greece The region has experienced 29 earthquakes with a magnitude of 6.0 or higher in the last 100 years On October 30, a 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck the eastern Aegean Sea between Turkey and Greece. The tremblor shook Izmir, Turkey, where it severely damaged 20 buildings. As of Monday, the death toll reached 91, including two teenagers in Greece, reports Al Jazeera. Greece and western Turkey sit above a complicated convergence of chunks of Earth’s crust called tectonic plates. Four plates meet under the Aegean Sea, putting immense pressure on the plate directly below Turkey, Maya Wei-Haas reports for National Geographic. That makes the region one of the most geologically active in the world. It’s seen at least 29 earthquakes with magnitudes above 6.0 in the last century, Jariel Arvin reports for Vox. Last week’s earthquake has caused more than 900 aftershocks, 42 of which had a magnitude above 4.0, Isil Jariyuce and Maija Ehlinger report for CNN."

However, the concerned authorities there said that the jolt ws too deep to cause any damage to the public property or the routine life in the region. They also said that no tsunami warning has been issued. According to the US Geological Survey (USGS), the earthquake in Philippines was of 7.0 magnitude at the Richter Scale and was located 95.8 kilometers (60 miles) below the sea and about 210 kilometers (130 miles) southeast of Pondaguitan in Davao Occidental province. the USGS went on to add that any kind of damage to the public or casualty was highly unlikely. The US tsunami warning system said that there was no tsunami threat from the recent earthquake in the Philippines. As per the Philippine institute of volcanology and seismology, the earthquake was felt in the nearby region and province of Pondaguitan. The southern Davao region has been battered by powerful earthquakes set off by local fault lines in recent years."
earthquake,"Reykjavik (CNN)Even for a volcanic island accustomed to the occasional tremor, this has been an unusual week for Iceland. According to the Icelandic Meteorological Office, around 17,000 earthquakes have hit the southwestern region of Reykjanes over the past week.
The largest quake, a magnitude 5.6 on the Richter scale, occurred on the morning of February 24. It was the loudest in a swarm that continues to rattle residents in the nearby capital city of Reykjavík and the municipalities around it, where two-thirds of the Icelandic population lives. Two larger earthquakes -- over magnitude 5.0 -- also hit on February 27 and March 1.
The quakes have caused little damage so far, though Iceland's Road and Coastal Administration has reported small cracks in roads in the area and rockfalls on steep slopes near the epicenter of the swarm.
""I have experienced earthquakes before but never so many in a row,"" Reykjavik resident Aueur Alfa ólafsdóttir told CNN. ""It is very unusual to feel the Earth shake 24 hours a day for a whole week. It makes you feel very small and powerless against nature."""

Typhoon,"Tropical Storm Cristobal develops in the Gulf of Mexico, may approach the U.S. by weekend We may be only on the second day of the official 2020 hurricane season, but already we’re tracking our third named tropical system in the Atlantic. Tropical Storm Cristobal was spinning in the Bay of Campeche at midday Tuesday. By the end of the week, the system is expected to slowly intensify in the Gulf of Mexico, with some data suggesting the storm could ultimately approach or even make a U.S. landfall. Tropical storm warnings are already up in Mexico from Campeche to Puerto de Veracruz as the system continues to organize, while there is concern closer to home for possible impacts by the weekend, depending on the storm’s track and intensity. The system was declared a “tropical depression” on Monday evening and upgraded to a tropical storm at 12:30 p.m. Eastern. This is the earliest third-named storm to form in the Atlantic basin, with the previous record being Tropical Storm Colin, which formed on June 5, 2016. The jury is out as to how exactly the storm will evolve. In fact, there’s even an outside chance that two named storms brew in the Gulf."

The hikers were not breathing and their hearts had stopped. The search for a total of 45 missing climbers has now been called off for the night. The volcano, about 200km (125 miles) west of Tokyo, erupted without warning on Saturday, spewing ash and rocks. About 250 people were trapped on the slopes of the popular beauty spot, but most got down safely.

drought,"The epic drought that began in the state of California in December 2011 and only officially ended in March of this year will have many lasting impacts—but one of the most severe is what it did to the trees in the central and southern Sierra Nevada mountains. A new study in the journal Nature Geosciences reports that by the drought’s peak, a combination of factors—including lack of rain, extreme heat and overcrowding stressed out the forest—lead to mass die-offs. In total, almost 150 million trees have died in California since the drought began.
Nathanael Johnson at Grist reports that to understand the tree-mageddon, researchers analyzed various forest communities in the mountains, including areas where 80 percent of the trees died and other where as few as two percent of the trees were lost."
earthquake,"The most surprising thing about the magnitude-8.9 earthquake that hit Japan today is that it was a surprise. Despite what may be the world's most intensive effort to map faults and assess risks by a notoriously earthquake-prone and earthquake-conscious nation, such a strong quake was not anticipated for the region, says University of Tokyo geophysicist Robert Geller.
The earthquake occurred 130 kilometers east of Sendai and 373 kilometers northeast of Tokyo, along or very near the boundary between two tectonic plates, where the Pacific plate is being drawn under the Japanese islands. Movement along plate boundaries is known to be capable of producing major earthquakes. And Japan's latest national seismic risk map gave a 99% chance of a magnitude-7.5 or greater quake occurring in that area in the next 30 years, Geller says.
Although today's quake technically satisfies that prediction, the logarithmic scale used for measuring the power of earthquakes means that a magnitude-8.9 earthquake releases well over 100 times more energy than does a magnitude-7.5 quake. ""I don't think those hazard assessments are meaningful,"" Geller says."

The 13m-long, 20-tonne module was driven into the rear of the orbiting platform, linking up with the other major Russian segments on the ISS.
Nauka should have launched in 2007, but the vessel suffered repeated slips in schedule, in part because of budget difficulties but also because engineers encountered a raft of technical problems during development.
Even after it launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan a week ago, it experienced propulsion issues that required workarounds from controllers in Moscow.
In the end, however, it made its docking with the station on the planned date."
wildfires,"The object in the sky is an aircraft flying around the fire in a circle. It is the Air Attack plane, or the spotter/lead plane that flies over the fire to watch its progress, map it, and relay the information to firefighters on the ground. At that point in the evening they must have had the autopilot on or set the aircraft so it was flying in perfect circles. The blinking navigation lights created the pattern that you see in the circle.
Intense wildfires have been surging across southern and northern California with little reprieve for firefighters or residents for several weeks. The intensity of the flames has increased because of the sudden heat wave sweeping into peak wildfire season. Last week fires burned over 250 acres across the Sierra Nevada foothills, and over 70,000 acres have been burned east of Sacramento by what’s being called the King fire, forcing thousands to flee their homes.
In Sight spoke with photographer Stuart Palley who grew up in southern California and has spent the past several years following and photographing these chaotic wildfires in beautiful, majestic ways. Palley immersed himself in extensive training both physically and in the classroom before venturing out with his camera equipment and personal fire gear. Though he’s made himself known in the firefighting community, Palley generally ventures out and photographs wildfires on his own. “I am almost always in sight of firefighters or with them if they pull to a safety zone, but it’s still a calculated risk and there’s some danger at each fire, but it pales in comparison to the risks and dangers those on the line for days at a time take,” he said."

The strong quake, which was originally estimated as 7.2 magnitude, hit at 6.09pm in Pacific waters off the Miyagi region with a depth of about 60 kilometres, the JMA said, issuing an advisory for tsunami waves of around one metre. Thousands of households received evacuation warnings over the tsunami alert, which was lifted at around 7.30pm , prompting municipalities to also end the evacuation measures."
wildfires,"In the wake of the enormous fires that have razed huge swathes of drought-stricken Australia, scientists fear that when rains eventually fall, they will wash charred debris into rivers, dams, and the ocean, killing wildlife and even tainting the drinking supplies of major cities, such as Sydney.
For many weeks, ash, soot, and blackened gum tree leaves have collected along the shorelines of Sydney’s beaches, clogging the waves and lapping in the tide. Originating in fires blazing in forested areas to the west, the debris has been carried on the breeze along with the pungent bushfire smoke that blanketed Australia’s largest city for much of December.
But what has carried on the wind is just a taste of the huge quantities of debris that are likely to wash into rivers once there are heavy downpours. As of press time, more than 26 million acres—an area bigger than Portugal—have now burned, mostly in the continent’s southeast. That includes areas of land known as catchments—also called watersheds—where rainfall begins its earthly journey into specific rivers, lakes, and dams.
It is an ecological disaster unprecedented in Australia’s history, and that spells trouble for drinking water supplies, coastal ecosystems, and the freshwater rivers that support iconic Australian wildlife, such as the platypus. (Australia's flying foxes are already dying en mass due to the extreme heat.)
“Disturbance on this scale is almost certainly going to impact biodiversity. I’m remarkably worried about the effects on freshwater ecosystems,” says Ross Thompson, a freshwater ecologist at the University of Canberra."

The damage was “massive and horrifying”, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Society (IFRC) said after surveying the worst-hit areas via helicopter.
Images on social media and local television showed billboards and rooftops blown off, trees snapped and electricity cables left fallen in the city’s streets.
President Filipe Nyusi said he believed the storm could be the deadliest to hit the southeast African country, adding that it was “a real disaster of great proportions”.
Appearing on state radio, he described seeing “bodies floating” in the water after two rivers broke their banks and “wiped out entire villages”. He said he expected the death toll, which currently stands at 84, to rise significantly to more than 1,000 deaths.
The United Nations’ humanitarian office said on Friday that electricity and communications in the city had been cut off by the cyclone.
It also warned of devastation outside Beira, in particular of livestock and crops, adding that the damage took place just before the main harvest season, which could exacerbate food insecurity in the region."
earthquake,"Indonesia earthquake: Dozens dead as search for survivors continues A powerful earthquake has rocked Indonesia's Sulawesi island, killing at least 42 people, with more feared dead as rescuers search for survivors. The 6.2-magnitude earthquake struck on Friday morning, just hours after an earlier, smaller tremor. Hundreds of people were injured and thousands displaced by the quake. Indonesia has a history of devastating earthquakes and tsunamis, with more than 2,000 killed in a 2018 Sulawesi quake. Eight people died when the five-storey Mitra Manakarra Hospital in Mamuju partially collapsed on Friday, officials said. About 60 people were safely evacuated from the hospital. ""It happened so quickly, around 10 seconds,"" Syamsu Ridwan, a local police spokesman, told the BBC. He said the power in the hospital cut out during the earthquake. Officials fear the death toll will increase as rescue efforts continue. Rescuers were still searching for survivors late on Friday, but they have been hampered by power cuts and poor mobile phone service. Indonesian President Joko Widodo offered condolences to the victims, urging people to stay calm and for the authorities to step up search efforts."
earthquake,"A strong earthquake has shaken central Chile, disrupting power and communications but causing no casualties or serious damage.
The quake had a magnitude of 7.1 and its epicentre was 70km (45 miles) northwest of Temuco with a depth of 25km, the US Geological Service said.
Hundreds of people in coastal areas fled to higher ground for fear of a tsunami, but no alert was issued.
An 8.8-magnitude quake in the same area last February caused huge destruction.
Chile's national emergency agency (Onemi) said there was no danger of a tsunami.
""Up until now we don't have any reports of injuries, there's no damage, just overloaded telephone lines and some partial power cuts,"" said Onemi's director, Vicente Nunez.
""We've told people to go back to their houses because there's no tsunami alert.""
The quake hit at 1720 (2020 GMT) and was centred about 600 kilometres (370 miles) southwest of the capital, Santiago.
The University of Chile's Institute of Seismology put the magnitude at 6.9.
Chile is still rebuilding after February's massive quake, which smashed infrastructure and triggered a tsunami that devastated several coastal towns, killing more than 400 people."
Typhoon,"The death toll from Typhoon Bopha climbed to more than 100 people on Wednesday, while scores of others remain missing in the worst-hit areas of the southern Philippines.
At least 43 people died when torrents of water rampaged down a mountain in New Bataan town in Compostela Valley province and engulfed a school and village hall where people were taking shelter from the storm. Nine soldiers and an unspecified number of villages were missing, army Maj. Gen. Ariel Bernardo told The Associated Press.
Six villagers drowned in floods in Montevista town, Compostela Valley provincial spokeswoman Fe Maestre said.
In nearby Davao Oriental province, 51 people died, mostly in floods, while two men perished when fierce wind ripped their boat from its mooring and it sank on central Siquijor island, according to disaster-response officials.
Bopha, one of the strongest typhoons to hit the country this year, struck Davao Oriental at dawn on Tuesday then barreled across southern and central provinces, triggering landslides, flooding and cutting off power in two entire provinces. It was roaring toward western Palawan province on Wednesday and was expected to blow out toward the South China Sea the next day."
wildfires,"Several small fires have sparked in the Payette National Forest in the last few days, according to forest service officials.
Meanwhile, a handful of other major fires continue to burn in west-central Idaho in parts of the Salmon-Challis National Forest, along with the Franch Church River of No Return Wilderness.
Firefighters report two fires in the Krassel Ranger District have burned about one-quarter of an acre each over the weekend. The Day Off Fire is located 3 miles east of Krassel Work Station. The Rainbow Fire is 5 miles northeast of Yellowpine. Both are expected to be contained by Sunday.
The quarter-acre Blue Fire started east of the Snake River near Council and has been contained.
Firefighters say several spot fires in the McCall Ranger District near Johnson Creek were similarly contained."
other,"Israel will offer a third dose of Covid vaccines to people aged over 60, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has said.
Those who got their second jab at least five months ago would be eligible for a Pfizer booster from Sunday, he said.
President Isaac Herzog, who turns 61 in September, was the first to get the booster on Friday.
This comes amid a surge in infections in Israel, and concern in many countries over the highly contagious Delta variant.
""Findings show that there is a decline in the body's immunity over time,"" Mr Bennett said at a briefing on Thursday.
""The aim of the supplementary dose is to build it up again, and thus reduce the chances of infection and serious illness significantly.”
The prime minister added that 2,000 people with weakened immune systems had already received a third dose with no severe side effects.
Experts say it is not yet clear whether a third dose will reduce Covid cases.
Last month, the Israeli authorities reintroduced a requirement to wear masks indoors amid a rise in cases.
Israel has been one of the most successful countries in the world in tackling the pandemic.
It carried out the fastest vaccination programme, under which well over half the population of 9.3 million has been partly or fully immunised.
Israel has reported nearly 870,000 infections since the start of the outbreak, with nearly 6,500 deaths, according to America's Johns Hopkins University."
wildfires,"More than 70 homes have been lost in a wildfire outside Australia's western city of Perth which is expected to continue burning for days.
The fire had razed more than 9,000 hectares of farm and woodland in hills east of Perth by early Wednesday, authorities said.
Western Australia state's Fire and Emergency Services Commissioner Darren Klemm said the number of houses destroyed had jumped to 71 from 59 overnight, and conditions would remain difficult for firefighters with no rain forecast until Sunday.  
""We're into Day 3 of this fire today and it's going to continue to be a challenging fire for us for at least the next three or four or five days,"" Klemm said.
Six firefighters sustained minor injuries, Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported. No other injuries were reported."
earthquake,"At 12.51 p.m. on Tuesday 22 February 2011, a magnitude 6.3 earthquake caused severe damage in Christchurch and Lyttelton, killing 185 people and injuring several thousand.
The earthquake’s epicentre was near Lyttelton, just 10 km south-east of Christchurch’s central business district. It occurred nearly six months after the 4 September 2010 earthquake.
The earthquake struck at lunchtime, when many people were on the city streets. More than 130 people lost their lives in the collapse of the Canterbury Television and Pyne Gould Corporation buildings. Falling bricks and masonry killed another 11 people, while eight died in two city buses that were crushed by crumbling walls. Rock cliffs collapsed in the Sumner and Redcliffs area, and boulders tumbled down the Port Hills, with five people killed by falling rocks.
Although not as powerful as the magnitude 7.1 earthquake on 4 September 2010, this earthquake occurred on a shallow fault line close to the city, so the shaking was particularly destructive.
The earthquake brought down many buildings damaged the previous September, especially older brick and mortar buildings. Heritage buildings that suffered heavy damage included the Provincial Council Chambers, Lyttelton’s Timeball Station, the Anglican Christchurch Cathedral and the Catholic Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament. Two-thirds of the buildings in the central business district were subsequently demolished, including the city’s tallest building, the Hotel Grand Chancellor.
Liquefaction was much more extensive than in September 2010. Shaking turned water-saturated layers of sand and silt beneath the surface into sludge that squirted upwards through cracks. Thick layers of silt covered properties and streets, and water and sewage from broken pipes flooded streets. House foundations cracked and buckled, wrecking many homes. Irreparable damage necessitated the demolition of several thousand homes, and large tracts of suburban land were subsequently abandoned, with 8,000 properties bought by the government and razed."
wildfires,"Alaska has now seen 5.08 million acres burn so far this wildfire season, the second-largest number since records began 76 years ago.
This summer's acreage -- equivalent to nearly 8,000 square miles -- edged out 1957 but will likely fall far short of 2004, the record year when about 6.6 million acres went up in flames, officials say.
Fire official Sam Harrel said that as the dry season in Alaska comes to an end, the chances for lightning to strike and cause new blazes are much lower.
""Things are winding down,"" said Harrel, spokesperson with the Alaska Fire Service. ""We have started our seasonal weather pattern of scattered rains.""
He cautioned that Alaska could still see an increase in human-caused fires as the hunting season picks up.
About 238 wildfires continued to burn Monday, with the vast majority being allowed to take their course. Some 97 firefighters are focusing their efforts on protecting the village of Hughes from an advancing blaze along the Koyukuk River.
Alaska has now dispatched firefighting crews to help in Wyoming and northern California."
wildfires,"A wildfire in Gila national forest burned through more timber and brush lands as it forced the evacuation of residents living near a privately owned ghost town in south-western New Mexico, officials said.
Fueled by strong, erratic winds, the Whitewater-Baldy complex fire burning through rugged and remote terrain grew Saturday to an estimated 100,000 acres, or more than 150 square miles. It was still 0% contained.
The evacuation of Mogollon, a privately owned ghost town, was ordered Saturday due to extreme wind.
Five helicopters and more than 600 firefighters from around the state were on hand to fight the blaze but still had to contend with ""extreme conditions"".
Cities as far away as Albuquerque remained under a health alert until Sunday afternoon due to smoke from the fire, which has spread across the state. State officials were warning residents during the Memorial Day weekend to limit outdoor activities, especially if smoke was visible.
The haze that blocked views of the Sandia mountains in Albuquerque on Friday appeared to have decreased by early Saturday afternoon, but smoke continued to hang over parts of the city.
Meanwhile on Saturday, crews in Colorado battled a wildfire that has scorched more than 3,000 acres of rugged canyon land near the Colorado-Utah border. US forest service spokesman Steve Segin said the fire started Friday afternoon and is burning in a remote area near Paradox. It is not threatening any structures, and no injuries have been reported."
wildfires,"The amount of land burned by wildfires in the U.S. this year has surpassed 9 million acres, according to data released Thursday by the National Interagency Fire Center.
This is only the fourth time on record the country has reached the 9 million-acre mark, center spokesman Randall Eardley said in an e-mail. The area burned is roughly equivalent to the size of New Jersey and Connecticut combined.
All of the top years for acres burned have occurred since 2000, Eardley said. The worst year occurred in 2006, with 9.8 million acres. In 2007 and 2012, 9.3 million acres were burned, he said. If another 800,000 acres are burned this year, an all-time record would be set.
Accurate wildfire records go back to 1960. Prior to 2000, the U.S. surpassed 7 million acres only one time — in 1963. ""The year 2000 seems to have been a turning point in the number of acres we've seen burned,"" Eardley said.
This year's fire season has been unusually severe in the Northwest. Wildfires there destroyed dozens of homes and forced hundreds of residents to evacuate, sometimes for weeks on end."
other,"A Chinese nuclear plant has shut down one of its reactors for maintenance after minor damage to fuel rods.
The plant operator said in a statement it had shut Unit 1 at the Taishan nuclear plant in Guangdong province after ""lengthy"" talks with technicians.
Taishan is the first site in the world to have this kind of reactor.
The type of reactor - known as EPR - is also set to be built in other countries, including Finland, France and at Hinkley Point C in the UK.
The latest move comes a month after the Chinese government acknowledged damage to fuel rods at the Taishan unit, but said it was a ""common"" problem, with no need for concern.
China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN) said in a statement on Friday that the reactor was ""completely under control"".
Engineers would find the cause of the damage and replace the fuel rods, the statement read.
In June CNN reported the US government was assessing a reported leak at the site.
CNN said French energy firm EDF, which helps run the site, had warned the US government that China's nuclear regulator had raised limits on permissible levels of radiation outside the plant to avoid shutting it down.
EDF later said a problem with fuel rods had led to the build-up of gases, which had to be released into the atmosphere.
Fuel rods are sealed metal tubes which hold nuclear materials used to fuel the nuclear reactor.
Last week an EDF spokesperson told CNN the French company would shut the plant down if it could.
They said the decision lay with the Chinese operator.
The situation at Taishan was ""not an emergency"" but nevertheless a ""serious situation"", the spokesperson added."
drought,"An estimated 45 million people are threatened with hunger by a severe drought strangling wide stretches of southern Africa.
Emergency food deliveries are planned for parts of South Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe and other countries hard hit by a combination of low rainfall and high temperatures.
“We are witnessing millions of already poor people facing extreme food insecurity and exhausting their reserves because of compounding climate shocks that hit already vulnerable communities hardest. They need help urgently,” said Nellie Nyang’wa, southern Africa director for the international aid agency, Oxfam.
“The scale of the drought devastation across southern Africa is staggering.”
Parts of Zimbabwe have had the lowest rainfall since 1981, contributing to making more than 5.5 million at risk of extreme food insecurity, Oxfam said in a report released Thursday.
Zambia’s rich maize-growing area has been hit hard and exports are now banned; 2.3 million people there are food-insecure, according to Oxfam and the Zambia Red Cross. The drought is also worsening food availability in Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, Madagascar and Namibia, Oxfam said.
Southern Africa has received normal rainfall in just one of the past five growing seasons, which particularly hits the small-scale farmers who depend on rain for their crops, the U.N. World Food Program said last week. The U.N. food agencies plan to distribute emergency food aid to 11 million people in the coming months.
Two cataclysmic cyclones hit Mozambique, Zimbabwe and other southern African countries early this year, wiping out crops of maize and other staple crops. Without normal rainfall, subsistence farmers are hard-pressed to recover from the destruction caused by the tropical storms.
“The successive mixture of drought and flooding has been catastrophic for many communities. In most of the affected areas there isn’t enough drinking water, which means that people and animals — both livestock and wildlife — are having to use the same water points,” said Kaitano Chungu, Secretary General of the Zambia Red Cross.
“This is unacceptable as it exposes people to diseases and creates a heightened risk of animal attacks.”
Some families in the worst-affected areas are surviving the food shortage by eating wild fruits and roots, Chungu said.
The drought has also affected the region’s wildlife. At least 105 elephants have died in Zimbabwe as a result of lack of water and vegetation, according to Zimbabwe’s National Parks."
earthquake,"Its epicenter was located 219 kilometers (136 miles) southeast of the city of Pundaguitan at a depth of 139 kilometers.
Residents of Davao, a major Philippine commercial center, felt the trembles as well.
A magnitude 7 earthquake rocked the Philippines' coast on Thursday, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) reported.
The earthquake was recorded at 12:23 GMT, the USGS added. Its epicenter was located 219 kilometers (136 miles) southeast of the city of Pundaguitan at a depth of 139 kilometers.
According to local news outlet Inquirer, residents of Davao, a major Philippine commercial center, felt the trembles as well.
No casualties and damage were reported so far."
drought,"Water companies, government bodies and environmental groups have warned that the extreme weather this summer could lead to a drought in spring next year.
Heatwaves across the country saw hosepipe bans come into force and put pressure on farmers, whose harvests were affected by the dry conditions.
The National Drought Group (NDG), which is made up of various water and environment organisations, gathered on Thursday to discuss how to maintain supplies in the event of a 2019 drought.
Water companies, government bodies and environmental groups have warned that the extreme weather this summer could lead to a drought in spring next year.
Heatwaves across the country saw hosepipe bans come into force and put pressure on farmers, whose harvests were affected by the dry conditions.
The National Drought Group (NDG), which is made up of various water and environment organisations, gathered on Thursday to discuss how to maintain supplies in the event of a 2019 drought.
Sir James Bevan, chief executive of the Environment Agency, chaired the NDG meeting and said that early action and planning would be necessary to avert this situation.
“Ensuring sufficient water for the public, the economy and the environment is one of biggest challenges we face as a country,” he said.
“The Environment Agency will continue to work actively with the water companies and other water users to seek to ensure that.”
Dry conditions over the summer were linked to devastating fires around Oldham and Bolton, and caused disruption to British wildlife including hedgehogs, birds and frogs.
The Environment Agency responded to more than 300 dry-weather related incidents over the past few months, more than three times the usual number for the summer.
Farmers accused the government of taking “little action” after environment secretary Michael Gove pledged to help them recover from the challenging summer conditions.
Recent efforts to save water combined with spells of rain have helped the sector recover, but for some crops and species the full effects of the summer are yet to be seen."
wildfires,"Experts fear that a sharp drought and ongoing deforestation could trigger a repeat of the large fires of August 2019. Government efforts implemented in May to stop fires don’t appear to have been effective.
The number of forest fires in Brazil's Amazon rainforest increased 28% in July in comparison to last year, the country's National Institute for Space Research reported Saturday.
Brazil holds around 60% of the Amazon basin region and environmentalists say this area is vital to containing the impact of climate change.
The state agency recorded 6,803 fires in the Amazon last month, compared to 5,318 in the same month of 2019.
Environmentalists were alarmed by the figure, particularly because August traditionally marks the beginning of the fire season in the region. Many now fear that a repeat of the large surge in fires that devastated the area last August could occur this year again.
 ""More than 1,000 fires in a single day is a 15-year record and shows the government's strategy of media-spectacle operations is not working on the ground,"" Greenpeace spokesman Romulo Batista said in a statement.
The fires have been largely set to clear land illegally for farming, ranching and mining. Activists accuse Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro of encouraging the deforestation, as he has been in favor of opening up the rainforest to agriculture and industry.
The first six months of 2020 were already the worst on record for deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, with 3,069 square kilometers (1,185 square miles) cleared, according to INPE data, an area larger than the nation of Luxembourg."
wildfires,"How much do you really know about wildfires in California? The Western U.S. is enduring an unprecedented fire year, and one thing's clear: the fires we face today are different from the fires of the 19th and 20th Centuries.
From public health in the smoke plume to remote-controlled hobby aircraft interfering with firefighting efforts to instant access to information via social media, life in fire country is ever changing.
Here are ten important facts about wildfires in the Golden State. How many did you know?
There are two distinct wildfire seasons in California: ones driven by Santa Ana winds (usually October to April) and ones generally exacerbated by heat in the summer months (usually June to September). Santa Ana fires spread more quickly, while non-Santa Ana fires spread more slowly and are considered less intense, though they can burn longer.
Climate change will probably worsen wildfires, but wildfires can also make climate change worse. When undisturbed, forests and wildlands capture and store millions of tons of carbon from the atmosphere in California; wildfires release carbon back into the atmosphere, exacerbating climate change. An April 2015 study by the National Park Service and UC Berkeley, published in Forest Ecology and Management, showed that five to seven percent of carbon emissions between 2001 and 2010 came from wildfires.
Look forward to more burned-over landscapes in California. A September 2015 paper published in Environmental Research Letters by scientists from the University of California predicts that California land burned by wildfires will increase in the coming decades. By comparing temperature, wind, and relative humidity in the present climate with projections from five different global climate models, they are able to project that area burned by Santa Ana fires will increase by 64 percent; and the area burned by non-Santa Ana fires will increase by 77 percent. Factors that point to this increase: an increase in more intense Santa Ana winds and an increase in temperatures, both due to climate change."
wildfires,"A fast-moving wildfire in Washington state has left nearly 3,000 acres scorched and forced thousands of residents from their homes.
So far, more than 24 homes have been destroyed.
""We've got hundreds of homes under evacuation notices,"" Rich Magnussen of the Chelan County Emergency Management Office told ABC News affiliate KOMO-TV.
Fire officials overnight declared a Level 3 evacuation, going door-to-door telling residents to leave.
""I thought I'd get there and it'd be like, smoky,"" resident Christie Adams said. ""Our backyard was on fire.""
In Wenatchee, burning embers from the so-called Sleepy Hollow Fire helped set local downtown businesses ablaze. At one wholesale plant, flames mixed with propane tanks created dangerous explosions.
""We could see embers just flying,"" said Albert Rookard, who watched the fire from the other side of the Wenatchee River. ""There was fire in so many places.""
Fire officials said the combination of rain this morning with dying winds had helped tame the fires in the hills. The fires in the downtown and residential areas remained active. An industrial fire in downtown Wenatchee continued to shoot thick, black smoke as officials issued an ammonia leak, warning residents to shelter in place.
A red-flag warning remained in effect till 8 p.m. today, though the fires on the hills appeared to be out.
Dominick Bonny, who watched the wildfire from across the Wenatchee River as well, called the scene ""mind-blowing.""
""It was like we were watching a natural disaster within arm's reach,"" Bonny said. ""We watched the entire hill burn.""
Two firefighters were treated for smoke inhalation and another two, for heat-related issues. One firefighter had to be sent to a hospital.
The cause of the fire was still unknown."
Typhoon,"There has been a lull in tropical activity around the globe for the beginning of September, with most of the activity occurring in the Atlantic. Fortunately, none of these storms have developed to become monster storms that threatened large areas of land. For now, the main focus is across the western North Pacific Ocean where a super typhoon has its eyes set for parts of South Korea and the Japanese island of Okinawa. The good news about Super Typhoon Sanba is that it will likely gradually weaken as it pushes to the north. However, the storm will likely pack a punch across South Korea.
Sanba, which was the 17th tropical depression to form in the western North Pacific Ocean developed on September 11, 2012. Within two days, Sanba hit ideal conditions to strengthen into a Category 5 hurricane, which we call a “Super Typhoon” in the western Pacific. “Super-typhoon” is a term utilized by the U.S. Joint Typhoon Warning Center for typhoons that reach maximum sustained 1-minute surface winds around 130 knots or 150 miles per hour. If you compare this to the Saffir-Simpson scale, it would be a very strong category 4 or 5 hurricane in the Atlantic basin. Yesterday, Sanba moved over very warm waters and was able to develop maximum sustained winds of 175 mph with gusts approximately around 200 mph. Just as a reference to give you an idea how strong Sanba truly is, an EF-4 tornado has sustained winds around 168-199 mph. Fortunately, systems that gain such a large increase in strength tend to weaken and undergoes an eye wall replacement cycle. Once a new eye forms, it could intensify again (assuming conditions remain favorable)."
Typhoon,"Dolly, the fourth named storm of the hurricane season, forms off the Northeast coast (CNN)What was once Subtropical Depression Four strengthened into Tropical Storm Dolly on Tuesday. This makes it the fourth named storm of an already busy Atlantic Hurricane season. ""The wind field has contracted to make Dolly no longer a subtropical system,"" says CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen.Satellite-derived wind data shows that the storm has strengthened to 45 mph, the National Hurricane Center said in a special update. This is the third time this decade a ""D"" named storm has formed this early in the Atlantic, says CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward. ""Dolly has formed in the North Atlantic -- the 3rd earliest 4th Atlantic named storm formation on record (since 1851),"" tweeted Colorado State University research scientist Phil Klotzbach."
Typhoon,"A powerful typhoon that hit the Kinki and Shikoku regions passed into the Sea of Japan Sunday after leaving at least 20 people dead and 55 missing in six prefectures.
The dead included 12 in Wakayama Prefecture and three more in Nara Prefecture.
The figures could rise when rescue efforts — disrupted by damaged roads and other factors in some typhoon-hit areas, mainly in the Kii Peninsula of Wakayama Prefecture — resume, local authorities said.
Typhoon Talas had crossed Okayama and Tottori prefectures by Sunday afternoon, moving into the Sea of Japan.
But the Meteorological Agency still called for vigilance, noting the slow-moving typhoon could bring heavy rains to western Japan, possibly causing more mudslides and flooding.
In four towns in Wakayama, including Nachikatsuura and Shingu, more than 3,600 people in 37 areas had been cut off in isolated pockets of the prefecture as of Sunday night, it was learned."

Typhoon,"Tropical storm Cristobal a possible landfall threat to Gulf coast Tropical storm Cristobal has formed in the Bay of Campeche as the third named storm of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season. Cristobal is forecast to head into the Gulf of Mexico, with a course towards the United States Gulf Coast and a landfall as a strengthening tropical storm, or perhaps even as hurricane Cristobal, now seen as a possibility. Updated 07:00 BTS Jun 3rd: Tropical storm Cristobal has formed out of a low pressure remnant that formed after a Pacific tropical storm named Amanda crossed over Central American country of Guatemala and crossed Mexico. Once the low pressure remnant emerged over the Bay of Campeche it became a tropical depression and then was soon upgraded to tropical storm Cristobal. Tropical storm Cristobal is currently packing 60 mph sustained winds and higher gusts, with minimum central pressure of 994 mb. Having spent recent hours circling close to the Mexican coastline, Cristobal has shifted southeast and is likely to make landfall crossing the southern Bay of Campeche coast later today. After a time inland, the forecast models show Cristobal moving back north and emerging back over the Bay of Campeche around Thursday night and into Friday. Forecast models then show Cristobal moving steadily north across the Gulf, which does mean it could be the first landfall threat to insurance and reinsurance market interests of the 2020 Atlantic storm season. The storm is now forecast to head slowly out into the Gulf of Mexico after meandering for a time near the shore, with strengthening likely and many forecast models are showing storm Cristobal heading towards the U.S. Gulf Coast and strengthening, with a slim chance currently of reaching hurricane status before its arrival. The immediate threat is severe rainfall to Mexico, with totals of 10 to 20 inches and isolated maximum amounts of 25 inches expected over parts of the Mexican states of Tabasco and Campeche. More broadly, 10 to 15 inches of rain is expected over parts of the Mexican states of Chiapas, Veracruz, Quintana Roo, Yucatan and Oaxaca, while rainfall of 10 to 15 inches, with isolated amounts of 25 inches, is expected along the Pacific coasts of Chiapas, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Some of these Pacific areas have already experienced up to 20 inches of rain, so ground is sodden and there is a risk of life-threatening flash floods and mudslides. After tropical storm Cristobal emerges back into the Gulf there remains significant uncertainty over how well organised it will be and whether it will make it to the U.S., the probability appears to have declined overnight. Many forecast models continue to point towards a more central Gulf Coast landfall scenario, but there is still significant uncertainty and range in the forecast path for Cristobal, as well as in terms of potential intensity. You can view a recent forecast model run showing the intensity guidance for tropical storm Cristobal below, sourced from TropicalTidbits.com."
earthquake,"Major magnitude 8.1 earthquake - Kermadec Islands, New Zealand, on Thursday, 4 March 2021 at 19:28 (GMT) - information Source changed to USGS As most agencies put the quake magnitude close to 8, while only Geonet only lists it as a much lower magnitude 7.1 event, we decided to trust USGS as primary data source with a magnitude of 8.1. Update Fri, 5 Mar 2021, 02:05 Tsunami warning raised again after third powerful earthquake hit off the coast of North Island, NZ A third powerful earthquake hit off the coast of North Island, New Zealand on Friday, 5 March 2021, 7:28 am local time. This magnitude 8.1 quake occurred near the Kermadec Islands about 880 km north of New Zealand, at a depth of 20-24 km. Although this quake was not felt much in the nearby North Island, the New Zealand National Emergency Management Agency urged people in some areas to head for higher ground. A tsunami warning was raised over several coastal areas of both North and South Island, New Zealand. The warning was lifted later that day, at around 1:40 pm local time. According to the latest tsunami threat message from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, tsunami waves were measured as far as the French Polynesia more than 3000 km northeast of the earthquake's epicenter. The northern coast of New Zealand's North Island was hit by tsunami waves of about 0.16 meters high, i.e., only 16 centimeters. The areas hit include the coasts from North Cape to East Cape. No significant damage has been reported. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS ), the earthquake resulted from a reverse faulting in the Tonga-Kermadec subduction zone at a depth of about 22 km. USGS was also able to identify the earlier 7.4 quake as a foreshock preceding this quake by nearly 2 hours. The first of the three major earthquakes, which occurred 6 hours prior the second quake, did not directly cause the second and third quakes."
earthquake,"AS SO often with earthquakes, this one started almost imperceptibly. It was lunchtime, and people in Tokyo are apt to take tremors lightly. It took just a frozen heartbeat, though, for that to change. One of us was seated at a coffee shop along a huge slab of oak that sat 14. It shook so violently, people raced outside. Another of us was next to a busy kitchen; metal pots shook, then crashed off the shelves, and with the noise diners came rushing up from tables in the basement and out into the streets. Within minutes, Tokyo's narrow alleys were choked with people, some visibly shocked, most eerily quiet, listening to the clanking power lines overhead, and quite understandably bereft without mobile-phone signals. As I walked onto one of the shopping boulevards of Omote-Sando, a sea of evacuees from the buildings that run along it let out a roar of fear when a second—and then a third—aftershock hit. As cars swayed, and trees lurched overhead, you could feel the power of the beast writhing underneath Japan.
The country has long prepared for something like this—and it showed. Friends quickly offered advice.

Though phone signals were mostly dead (apparently to leave bandwidth for emergency services), the internet functioned. That meant e-mail and Skype worked, and Facebook and Twitter conveyed news, tips and just the sort of offbeat information that is uplifting in the face of adversity (according to one Facebook rumour, this being Japan, airlines are generously offering cheap flights for anyone wanting to leave the country).

Typhoon,"A typhoon swelled rivers and flooded low-lying areas as it passed over the storm-battered northeastern Philippines, leaving at least 13 people dead and 15 others missing, officials said Thursday.
The Philippine National Police reported the casualty figures, but gave no details.
Typhoon Vamco passed north of Manila between Bulacan and Pampanga provinces, toppling trees and knocking out power. Officials said earlier that nearly 200,000 people had been evacuated, some forcibly, from vulnerable coastal and low-lying areas.
Officials said about 1.9 million households were without power in Metro Manila and nearby provinces. Many electricity poles were toppled, power lines were knocked down and power transformers were damaged.
President Rodrigo Duterte took a break from an online summit of Southeast Asian leaders to fly by helicopter over the affected areas.
“As president I guarantee you that your government will do its best to provide assistance in the form of shelters, relief goods, financial aid and post-disaster counseling. Rest assured, the government will not leave anybody behind. We will get through this crisis,” Duterte said in a televised address.
Rescue teams were deployed to flooded areas in Rizal province, coast guard chief Adm. George Ursabia told DZBB radio.
Marikina city Mayor Marcie Teodoro said fierce winds knocked down power lines overnight, leaving many areas without power and internet service. Heavy rains also flooded many areas and the Marikina River was swollen. Many people in Marikina city were waiting to be rescued from roofs.
“There are many areas that historically don’t get flooded but now they are swamped, like city hall,” he told DZBB radio.
Mark Timbal, spokesman for the government’s disaster response agency, said 363 rescue teams had been deployed consisting of 1,000 rescuers with at least 40 rubber boats.
The typhoon had maximum sustained winds of 130 kilometers per hour (80 mph) with stronger gusts Thursday morning. It was moving west-northwest at 30 kph (19 mph) and was headed for the South China Sea.
The government’s main disaster-response agency had pleaded to the media to relay typhoon alerts in northeastern areas devastated by an earlier typhoon, Goni, saying the agency’s messages could not be sent by cellphones due to damaged telecommunications systems.
Goni, one of the strongest typhoons in the world this year, left more than 30 people dead or missing and damaged or destroyed more than 270,000 houses, many in coastal villages. Tens of thousands of people remain displaced.
The Philippines is hit by about 20 typhoons and tropical storms each year. It is located on the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are common, making it one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries."
wildfires,"Alaska, the great northern frontier of America, is being reshaped by climate change. While rising temperatures are altering its character and landscape, they are also bringing the ravages of wildfires.
In the past 60 years, Alaska has warmed more than twice as fast as the rest of the country, with average temperatures up by nearly 3°F. By 2050, temperatures are projected to climb an additional 2-4 degrees, with the Arctic region seeing the most dramatic increases. These rising temperatures are expected to increase wildfire risks in Alaska, just as they have in the rest of the western U.S.Wildfires have been on the rise across the western U.S. since the 1970s, at the same time that spring and summer temperatures have increased dramatically, and average spring snowpack has declined substantially.
Fires in Alaska don’t often make news in the lower 48, but they threaten vast expanses of forest, parkland, and tundra that store immense quantities of carbon. The state’s growing number of large wildfires have the potential to damage these ecosystems, and the people and wildlife that depend on them, while releasing a significant amount of carbon into the atmosphere, further contributing to global warming. Wildfire emissions over these vast areas also threaten air quality in Alaska and beyond."
Typhoon,"Florida governor Ron DeSantis has declared a state of emergency as Hurrican Dorian nears the US mainland.
Puerto Rico's Director of Public Safety Elmer Roman also warned residents to keep their guard up as the hurricane's path veers.
The hurricane will likely hit the Carribean island today, It is expected to strengthen into a category 3 storm by the time it hits Florida."
earthquake,"A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck off Japan's northeastern coast on Saturday, authorities said, but no tsunami warning was issued and there were no immediate reports of damage.
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) said the mid-morning quake hit at a depth of 47 kilometres (29 miles) in the Pacific, off Ishinomaki in Miyagi prefecture -- near the epicentre of a huge 2011 quake which triggered a towering tsunami, killing more than 18,000 people.
Japan's meteorological agency said there was no tsunami risk following Saturday's jolt, which produced strong shaking along parts of the eastern coast and was also felt in Tokyo.
""We are still collecting information but have not received any reports of injuries or damage,"" local government spokesman Tomoki Sawata told AFP, calling the quake ""fairly strong"".
Local railway firms suspended services, including of shinkansen bullet trains, public broadcaster NHK said, while elevators stopped in some buildings in Miyagi.
Fukushima nuclear plant operator TEPCO said the facility, which melted down in the wake of the 2011 tsunami, did not show any abnormalities after the latest jolt.
""Operations are under way as usual,"" TEPCO spokesman Koichiro Shiraki told AFP.
Japan sits on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", an arc of intense seismic activity that stretches through Southeast Asia and across the Pacific basin.
The country is regularly hit by quakes, and has strict construction regulations intended to ensure buildings can withstand strong tremors.
In March, a strong 7.2-magnitude earthquake struck off the northeastern coast. Japan's authorities issued a tsunami advisory but there was no damage on the coastline.
The region was also shaken by another strong quake in February that injured dozens. Meteorologists said it was an aftershock of the 2011 quake."
wildfires,"Australia's wildfires have destroyed more than a fifth of the country's forests, making the blazes ""globally unprecedented"" following a years-long drought linked to climate change, researchers said Monday.
Climate scientists are currently examining data from the disaster, which destroyed swathes of southeastern Australia, to determine to what extent they can be attributed to rising temperatures.
In a special edition of the journal Nature Climate Change, Australian researchers examined several other aspects of the blazes, including investigations into their extent and possible causes.
One study showed that between September 2019 and January 2020 around 5.8 million hectares of broadleaf forest were burned in New South Wales and Victoria.
This accounts for roughly 21 percent of the nation's forested area, making this fire season proportionately the most devastating on record.
""Halfway through Spring 2019 we realised that a very large part of the eastern Australian forest could be burned in this single season,"" Matthias Boer, from the Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment at Western Sydney University, Penrith, told AFP.
""The shock came from realising that this season was off the charts globally in terms of the percentage of the continental section of a forest biome that burned.""
Boer said his study almost certainly underestimates the extent of forest loss as the island state of Tasmania was not covered in the data.
Australia's annual average forest loss to wild fires is typically well below 2 percent."
Typhoon,"A typhoon that slammed in eastern China's coast Wednesday flooded and washed out roads, knocked out power and disrupted transportation in one of the nation's most populous regions.
Damage to roads and bridges stranded hundreds of people though no casualties were immediately reported, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
Typhoon Haikui came ashore in Zhejiang province with winds up to 150 kilometres per hour early Wednesday and was weakening.
Shanghai Public Weather Service said Haikui dumped as much as 58 millimetres in one hour in the city's centre in the afternoon.
In Zhejiang, 12 townships lost power. Flooding left at least 130 people stranded in three hotels in Lin'an city after roads were washed out. In Anji county, about 300 tourists were trapped after a bridge was destroyed, Xinhua said.
The China Meteorological Administration had issued a red alert for Typhoon Haikui, the highest alert so far this year. More than 1.8 million people were evacuated from parts of heavily populated Shanghai and neighbouring Zhejiang.
Shanghai, which has 23 million people and is the country's financial hub, banned many outdoor activities. It curtailed public transit, cancelled more than 500 flights, and halted at least 600 trains on Wednesday, local media said.
The city relocated 374,000 residents and Zhejiang evacuated more than 1.5 million people, Xinhua said.
China is still recovering from typhoons Damrey and Saola, which hit over the weekend and caused at least 23 deaths. Saola also battered Taiwan and the Philippines and was blamed for about 60 deaths in the two countries."

Monitoring for hydrothermal eruptions is a huge challenge as the eruption is caused by steam, not magma, which is harder to track Five people have been confirmed dead, 31 remain in hospital with injuries and eight are still missing after sudden volcanic eruptions on Whakaari/White Island off the east coast of New Zealand. The island is a tourist destination and 47 people were on it when it erupted on Monday afternoon. Three of those rescued have now been discharged from hospital. Volcanologists at GeoNet, which operates a geological hazard monitoring system, described the eruption as impulsive and short-lived, with an ash plume that rose to more than 3km above the vent. On Tuesday morning the New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern praised the courage of the first responders and pilots who conducted an aerial survey. She confirmed that the flyovers have shown no signs of life. Police were assessing whether it was safe to return to the island for a recovery operation."

Didier Trebucq, UN Resident Coordinator for Barbados and the Caribbean, briefed journalists on response to the growing humanitarian crisis sparked after long-dormant La Soufrière volcano erupted last week, displacing some 20,000 people, or roughly one-fifth of the population. Around 6,000 are considered vulnerable. “We are about to initiate the UN funding appeal and response plan to support the humanitarian response, but also the early recovery for the next six months”, he said, speaking via video link from Barbados. “This is a crisis that is going to last certainly more than six months in the sub-region, in Saint Vincent, and other islands.”"
earthquake,"_zmir/Turkey: Earthquake Situation Report No: 03, 31 October 2020 Background A magnitude 6.6 earthquake struck the western province of Izmir, Turkey on Friday, October 30, 2:51 pm local time. The European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre said the quake had an epicentre 13 km northeast of the Greek island of Samos. The earthquake was felt in provinces as far as Istanbul, Bodrum, Mu_la, and Manisa. Soon after the initial quake, the Province was shaken further by 389 aftershocks, with 33 of them more powerful than magnitude 4.0. The quake has left severe damage to the structures and infrastructures in different areas of Bornova and Bayrakl_ regions of the city, pushing the residents to flee in panic into the streets. At least 17 buildings have been reported collapsed and several others damaged."
wildfires,"Alaskan fire crews are fighting two tundra fires sparked by lightning in the southwest of the state, which has experienced a warm winter with little snow, according to AP.
By Monday the fires had covered 63 square miles of the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge, the AP report said, but weekend rain helped quell the spread. The fires are burning in a biologically diverse area, home to nesting waterfowl and a variety of plant species.
“There’s lots of vegetation,” Fish and Wildlife Service fire ecologist Lisa Saperstein said. “And where you have vegetation, it’s fuel.”
Tundra fires are sometimes allowed to burn out on their own if they don’t threaten infrastructure. In this case, fire information spokesman Tim Mowry said, crews weren’t sent to fight one of the fires until it grew to almost 20 square miles in size. As of Monday, the fires remained about 50 miles away from the town of Bethel, AP reported.
Saperstein said that tundra fires are rarer than forest fires in southwest Alaska, but do still occur.
Areas with less snow have less moisture in the ground, putting them at greater risk of fire. A 2013 report by the University of Alaska Fairbanks Cooperative Extension Service states that Alaska may see a growth in tundra fires in the coming century due to climate change."
earthquake,"Japan's most powerful earthquake since records began has struck the north-east coast, triggering a massive tsunami.
Cars, ships and buildings were swept away by a wall of water after the 8.9-magnitude tremor, which struck about 400km (250 miles) north-east of Tokyo.
A state of emergency has been declared at a nuclear power plant, where pressure has exceeded normal levels.
Officials say 350 people are dead and about 500 missing, but it is feared the final death toll will be much higher.
In one ward alone in Sendai, a port city in Miyagi prefecture, 200 to 300 bodies were found.
The quake was the fifth-largest in the world since 1900 and nearly 8,000 times stronger than the one which devastated Christchurch, New Zealand, last month, said scientists.
Thousands of people living near the Fukushima nuclear power plant have been ordered to evacuate.
Japanese nuclear officials said pressure inside a boiling water reactor at the plant was running much higher than normal after the cooling system failed.
Officials said they might need to deliberately release some radioactive steam to relieve pressure, but that there would be no health risk.
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had earlier said the US Air Force had flown emergency coolant to the site."

The eruption of Mount Nyiragongo on Saturday night sent about 5,000 people fleeing from the city of Goma across the nearby border into Rwanda, while another 25,000 others sought refuge to the northwest in Sake, the U.N. children’s agency said Sunday. More than 170 children were still feared missing Sunday, and UNICEF officials said they were organizing transit centers to help unaccompanied children in the wake of the disaster."
earthquake,"Residents of Cape Town have been left shook after a 6.2 magnitude earthquake rocked the region on Saturday night. The substantial tremor rumbled many in the south-west, with residents of Melkbosstrand bearing the brunt of the seismic event.
The actual quake happened some 1 800km offshore, deep in the South Atlantic Ocean. Residents have reported feeling the effects, with houses shaking and the ground moving. Despite taking locals by surprise, it seems the after-effects will be minimal at worst.
The US Geological Survey has concluded that there will be a ‘low threat to life’, due to the earthquake’s strength. Although 6.2 on the Richter Scale does mark a significant event for Cape Town, it’s unlikely that it will trigger a tsunami or any follow-up damage."
wildfires,"Several large wildfires have charred tens of thousands of acres in northern California. The largest, the Rocky fire, had burned about 60,000 acres (24,000 hectares) in Lake, Yolo, and Colusa counties as of August 3, 2015. Farther north, the Fork Complex fire and the Mad River Complex fire had burned a combined 39,000 acres.
The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Terra satellite collected this image on August 2, 2015. Red outlines indicate hot spots where the sensor detected unusually warm surface temperatures associated with fires. Plumes of smoke are visible drifting from the hot spots.
The Rocky fire has destroyed two dozen homes and forced the evacuation of 12,000 people, according to news reports."

Here is a 360-degree look at the volatile volcano. According to New Zealand’s official earthquake monitoring body, GeoNet, explosive eruptions can happen with little or no warning. They eject cannonball-like hot rocks, ash clouds and surges of boiling gases and rock projectiles into the air. This is what happened on Monday. For the 47 tourists on the island, the impact was immediate and devastating."
wildfires,"Firefighters have beaten back parts of the nine blazes raging in southern California, allowing thousands of displaced locals to return to the area.
But a flare-up of a wildfire in San Marcos prompted more than 13,000 new evacuation notices to residents.
The fires have destroyed at least 18 houses and two businesses and caused more than $20m (?12m) in damage.
A badly burned body was found in Carlsbad, but no details were available on its identity or cause of death.
Schools across the region were closed and a nuclear plant and a military base were earlier evacuated.
Months of drought have made California particularly prone to fire this year, and the crews managing the evacuations and battling the blazes have had to contend with sweltering heat.
But calmer winds on Thursday allowed aircraft - including four air tankers and 22 military helicopters - to be deployed to fight the flames.
The Legoland theme park in Carlsbad was closed earlier due to power surges, while San Onofre nuclear power plant briefly evacuated non-essential staff as a precautionary measure.
And the campus of California State University-San Marcos, with almost 10,000 students, was shut down amid the university's final exams, with all commencement ceremonies cancelled.
Fires also hit the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton, between San Diego and Los Angeles.
Carlsbad fire chief Michael Davies said such fires were unprecedented this time of year."
Typhoon,"A senior U.N. humanitarian official said Monday that nearly 10 million people in the Philippines have been affected by the massive typhoon that ravaged the country on Friday.
John Ging, operations director of the U.N.’s humanitarian office, told reporters that 9.8 million people have been affected and 660,000 displaced from what he said was the biggest typhoon recorded in nearly a century.
Ging said the devastation wa huge and the U.N. was mobilizing for a massive response.
“We, in the United Nations and with our international NGO partners, are very much in support and we are focused on - as you would expect -- first and foremost, on the requirements for food, the requirements for shelter support, the requirements for medical support, to prevent the outbreak of public health disasters with so many people - estimated now over 10,000 people perished,” he said.
Ging expressed hope that the death toll would not go higher, but said everyone must be prepared for the worst as responders reach remote areas.
He commended the Philippine authorities, who he said were responding in a “very impressive” way.
Ging said efforts to reach those in need were complicated by logistical constraints, including damage to infrastructure, roads and airports.
U.N. Humanitarian chief Valerie Amos is on her way to the Philippines where she will launch an appeal for funds on Tuesday. In the meantime, the U.N. has released $25 million from its Central Emergency Relief Fund to assist aid agencies in quickly mobilizing relief efforts.
The international community has responded rapidly, sending plane loads of emergency supplies, medical and rescue teams."
Typhoon,"Delta has been downgraded from a once powerful hurricane to a tropical storm as it moves inland across the U.S. South.
The National Hurricane Center in Miami said Delta came ashore Friday evening in southwest Louisiana as a Category 2 hurricane but quickly weakened and has become a tropical storm as it moves inland.
The storm is moving to the north-northeast on a track across central and north Louisiana that is expected to continue through Saturday morning, forecasters said.
The National Hurricane Center in Miami said Delta came ashore Friday evening in southwest Louisiana as a Category 2 hurricane but quickly weakened and has become a tropical storm as it moves inland.
The storm is moving to the north-northeast on a track across central and north Louisiana that is expected to continue through Saturday morning, forecasters said.
The system is expected to become a tropical depression by later Saturday as it moves across northern Mississippi into the Tennessee Valley.
THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE: AP’s earlier story appears below.
Ripping tarps from already damaged roofs and scattering debris piled by roadsides, Hurricane Delta inflicted a new round of destruction on Louisiana as it struck communities still reeling after Hurricane Laura took a similar path just six weeks earlier.
Delta hit as a Category 2 hurricane, with top winds of 100 mph (155 kph) but rapidly grew weaker. It dwindled within hours to a weak Category 1 storm with 75 mph (120 kph) winds. Still, forecasters warned of danger from storm surge and flash floods across much of southwestern Louisiana and parts of neighboring Texas.
Delta made landfall Friday evening near the coastal town of Creole — a distance of only about 15 miles (24 kilometers) from where Laura struck land in August, killing 27 people in Louisiana. The earlier storm damaged nearly every home and building in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Piles of moldy mattresses, sawed-up trees and other debris still lined the streets.
Mayor Nic Hunter said tarps were flying off homes across the city.
“I’m in a building right now with a tarp on it and just the sound of the tarp flapping on the building sounds like someone pounding with a sledgehammer on top of the building,“ Hunter said as he rode out the storm downtown. ”It’s pretty intense.”
In Lake Charles, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland from where Delta came ashore, water leaked through the ceiling of Ernest Jack's bedroom as he tried to sleep Friday night. Jack said the tarp cover the roof damage caused by Laura hadn’t blown off. His windows were covered to protect against flying debris.
“It’s raining real hard; it’s flooding; the wind is strong,” Jack said Friday night. “I’m OK. I’m not worried about nothing, just praying that everything goes well.”"
earthquake,"Three earthquakes, including one of the strongest ever to hit the region, struck off the coast of New Zealand on Friday, triggering tsunami warnings that have now been stood down.
Thousands were evacuated from some coastal areas of the North Island after the third, 8.1-magnitude quake struck.
There were reports of traffic gridlock as people tried to reach higher ground.
The national tsunami warning was lifted at 15:43 (02:43 GMT), some 13 hours after the first quake.
Some wave surges hit parts of the coast but, by Friday afternoon, authorities said the largest waves had passed. Residents were told they could return home but were warned to stay off beaches."
drought,"More anthills than blades of grass are visible in some of the cracked earth around Junction. The year-long drought has plagued the town — as it has the rest of the state — and for a painful, six-week stretch, Junction banned all outdoor watering.
Some 4.5 inches of rain earlier this month increased the flow of the Llano River, two forks of which meet at the town. But the water is still pretty low — and four panelists at the Texas Water Symposium last week brought some unwelcome news to the townspeople: It’s not going to get any better anytime soon.
“As the state climatologist, people ask me, ‘When’s it going to rain?’” said John Nielsen-Gammon, one of the panelists, who is a professor of meteorology at Texas A&M University and the state's climatologist.
The answer, according to Nielsen-Gammon, is “eventually,” but chances are the drought will last another year, possibly even another decade.
The weather, or lack thereof, can be attributed to La Nia, a cyclical weather pattern resulting in cooler waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Meteorologists say that although La Nia had faded by the summer, it has now returned and is strengthening.
In the past 12 months, Texas has seen 11.1 inches of rainfall on average, according to Nielsen-Gammon, and it broke a heat record for the country that was previously set during the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. Texas AgriLife Extension Service estimates the cost of the drought to be about 5.2 billion, and that estimate — already out of date because it was compiled two months ago — doesn’t include the impact to several kinds of crops and the forestry industry.
Junction, known as the land of living waters, has seen some of its streams dry up. In August, town officials say, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality told Junction to cease outdoor water use of any kind when the town of Llano downstream reported it was close to running out of water."
wildfires,"Thousands of homes, a university campus, a nuclear plant, a Legoland and parts of one of the military's biggest and busiest bases: All have been evacuated due to a rare confluence of fast-moving wildfires scorching Southern California.
Cal Fire Division Chief Dave Allen said nine fires have burned 9,095 acres.
The Golden State has seen many such blazes before. But these are different because they sprung up so quickly, spread so fast, and hit months before the traditional height of wildfire season, making them menacing in the short- and long-term.
CNN meteorologist Jennifer Gray forecasts what the area might expect as the summer gives way to fall: ""This is only going to get worse.""
San Diego County district supervisor Bill Horn said Wednesday evening that eight fires were burning in the region, seven of which popped up that day.
Investigators haven't yet determined the cause of these fires. But Horn hasn't seen anything like this -- so many fires, so quick, all of them separate -- in at least 20 years. That this is happening in May, not July or October, is even more confounding to him.
""I'm sure it could be by chance,"" the clearly skeptical supervisor said. ""... I just think there's too much of a coincidence here.""
Whatever the cause -- whether it's a person or Mother Nature -- the impact is already being felt.
Carlsbad alone has issued 23,000 evacuation notices. Thousands of students won't have classes on Thursday due to the continuing threat; California State University-San Marcos canceled all activities through Friday, including commencement. Numerous roads have been shut down, while others have become clogged with people trying to escape.
Christina Echols of Oceanside hasn't been told to leave -- yet. But with her home sitting ""in the middle of three fires"" and a little over 7 miles from the San Onofre nuclear power plant, she knows that call could come at any moment."

wildfires,"Hundreds of firefighters yesterday battled a forest blaze which forced 2,000 people to evacuate their homes in the Spanish region of Valencia, officials said.
Authorities said late yesterday that the fire had ravaged 5,500 hectares of land since it broke out on Sunday and 800 personnel were working into the night to put it out.
The regional emergency services said in online updates that the fire had been “stabilised” and roads that were closed for safety earlier would start being reopened.
The fire broke out Sunday afternoon and spread quickly, fanned by strong winds and sustained by high temperatures.
It threatened six villages about 50 kilometres inland of the eastern city of Valencia, which lies on the Mediterranean coast.
“The village itself was not harmed but all the hills as far as you can see from the village have been burned,” Manolo Causera, deputy mayor of one of the villages, Gestalgar, told AFP.
About 2,000 people were evacuated from six villages in the area and several roads were cut off, Valencia officials said.
Thirty-one water-dumping aircraft doused water on woodland around villages such as Bugarra as bright flames devoured the dry vegetation, sending up thick grey smoke.
Enrique Silvestre, mayor of another of the evacuated villages, Chulilla, said earlier Monday that the situation was “very difficult”."
wildfires,"At least 100 homes were destroyed and 700 residents were evacuated because of a wildfire in the Texas panhandle, authorities said.
The Hutchinson County grass fire has had plenty of fuel provided by high winds and dry conditions, Fritch Police Chief Monte Leggett said.
“With the wind blowing the way it is, and the hot spots, the wind keeps switching from one direction to another so it's almost impossible [to fight],” Leggett said. “Plus, until daylight or they [have] got a lot better visibility, it's gonna be tough.”
Hutchinson County Emergency Management Coordinator Danny Richards said emergency crews from 26 counties were assisting. The fire was about 50 percent contained early today, he said, with a cold front giving firefighters optimism that the fire would be contained this morning.
Richards told ABC News that the fire had possibly burned more than 1,000 acres.
“It’s a disaster, and many people have lost their homes,” Richards said."
earthquake,"One of the strongest earthquakes to hit the South Pacific in modern history triggered tsunami warnings across the ocean and forced thousands of people in New Zealand to evacuate coastal areas Friday. Small tsunami waves were seen, but little damage was apparent hours later.
The magnitude 8.1 quake in the Kermadec Islands region about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) from New Zealand was the largest in a series of tremors over several hours, including two earlier quakes that registered magnitude 7.4 and magnitude 7.3.
The tsunami threat caused traffic jams and some chaos in New Zealand as people scrambled to get to higher ground.
Residents recorded videos of small wave surges in some places, including at Tokomaru Bay near Gisborne. In the afternoon, the National Emergency Management Agency said the threat had passed and people could return to their homes, although they should continue avoiding beaches.
One of the earlier quakes hit much closer to New Zealand and awoke many people as they felt a long, rumbling shaking. “Hope everyone is ok out there,” New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern wrote on Facebook during the night."

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) said the midmorning quake hit at a depth of 47 kilometers (29 miles) in the Pacific, off Ishinomaki, Miyagi prefecture, near the epicenter of the huge March 2011 quake that triggered a towering tsunami, killing more than 18,000 people. The USGS and Meteorological Agency said there was no tsunami risk following the jolt, which produced strong shaking along parts of the eastern coast and was also felt in Tokyo. Officials in Aomori, Fukushima and Iwate said no casualties had been reported and public broadcaster NHK said there were no immediate reports of damage. But a Meteorological Agency official warned strong aftershocks may hit the region in about a week, adding that expected bad weather may trigger landslides following the latest ground shaking. Two people were slightly injured after windows were broken at a station in Onagawa, Miyagi, NHK said. “We are aware of the news but still collecting information,” said Kazuto Takeda, an official with the prefecture’s disaster management office. NHK also said a woman in her 80s was treated in hospital after she fell at a supermarket in Fukushima. Some sections of expressways and train services, including those on the Tohoku Shinkansen Line, were suspended following the temblor, which was also felt in Tokyo. Tokyo Electric Power Co. Holdings is checking for any irregularities at its nuclear power plant in Fukushima, according to NHK. Tohoku Electric Power Co. found no abnormalities at its Onagawa, Higashidori nuclear plants, according to a spokesperson. Saturday marked the first day of a five-day holiday and a number of people were seen evacuating from JR Sendai Station, with university student Asuka Koike, who was on her way to her hometown in Fukushima Prefecture, saying, “I don’t know what to do. I’m afraid as there have been many earthquakes recently.” Japan sits on the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” an arc of intense seismic activity that stretches through Southeast Asia and across the Pacific basin. The country is regularly hit by quakes, and has strict construction regulations intended to ensure buildings can withstand strong tremors."

earthquake,"Death toll from Mexican quake rises to 10 as Oaxaca assess damage The area surrounding the popular Huatulco beach resort in the southern state of Oaxaca was hardest hit by the 7.4 magnitude quake, but the temblor was felt as far away as Mexico City. The death toll from a powerful earthquake that struck southern Mexico on Tuesday has risen to 10 people. Authorities confirmed the fatalities on Wednesday as locals began to clear the rubble and assess the damage from the temblor. The area surrounding the popular Huatulco beach resort in the southern state of Oaxaca was hardest hit by the 7.4 magnitude quake, but the shaking could be felt as far away as Mexico City, where tall buildings swayed and thousands of people raced into the streets. Roughly 30 buildings in the capital were damaged and in a northern neighbourhood that was hard hit by a 2017 earthquake, some residents had to evacuate their homes. ""This apartment has always been my home. It's where I was born, where I grew up, where I have all my memories,"" Aura Preisser said while removing her belongings from the building, which was cordoned off by authorities. ""If I lost it, I would lose not only my home, but a large part of my heart."""
Typhoon,"As the full devastation of Typhoon Haiyan became more evident Sunday, frustrations were running high among survivors desperate for relief aid three days after the disaster.
Typhoon Haiyan pummeled the Philippines’ eastern seaboard Friday. It flattened buildings and toppled trees, and authorities are still struggling to assess the full extent of damage left behind.
Survivors in some areas hardest-hit do not have access to food, water or an ability to communicate. Even the Philippine Red Cross and the ICRC offices in badly-hit Tacloban had been damaged, forcing staff to relocate temporarily.
“The devastation is ... I don't have the words for it,"" Interior Secretary Mar Roxas said. ""It's really horrific. It's a great human tragedy.""
The country had been bracing for rain and winds, but a massive storm surge of six metres caught the archipelago by surprise Friday, reaching up to a kilometre inland. Residents drowned and were washed away.
With winds that gusted to 275 kilometres per hour, officials say the typhoon was more powerful than 2007’s Hurrican Katrina, and twice as strong as Hurricane Sandy, which devastated parts of Northeastern United States last year.
The destruction is far-reaching:
	_	_stimates say at least 4 million people have been affected by the storm.
	_	_aiyan inflicted serious damage to at least six of the archipelago's more than 7,000 islands
	_	_he islands of Leyte, Samar and the northern part of Cebu appearing to bear the brunt of the storm.
	_	_NICEF estimated that 1.7 million children live in areas affected by the typhoon.
At least 300 people were confirmed dead and 2,000 missing on the eastern island of Samar, where some towns remain inaccessible to emergency crews. An official from the provincial disaster office in Samar said there was no power or cellphone signals.
The death toll in Tacloban, the capital city of Leyte Island, is estimated at 10,000. There, corpses were found laying in the streets, cars floating in water. Homes along the shoreline were severely damaged. In one area of the city, a large ship had been pushed ashore.
Tacloban Mayor Alfred Romualdez said the devastation has touched all residents. “I have not spoken to anyone who has not lost someone, a relative close to them,” he said.
Philippine-born Australian Mila Ward, 53, told The Associated Press that she passed “well over 100” bodies on the street on the way to Tacloban airport.
“They were covered with just anything _ tarpaulin, roofing sheets, cardboard,” she said."
Typhoon,"Dolly (was Subtropical Depression 4) _ North Atlantic Ocean June 23, 2020 _ NASA Satellite Gives a Hello to Tropical Storm Dolly During the morning of June 23, the fourth system in the Northern Atlantic Ocean was a subtropical depression. By the afternoon, the subtropical depression took on tropical characteristics and was renamed Dolly. NASA’s Terra satellite greeted Tropical Storm Dolly by taking an image of the new tropical storm. At 1 p.m. EDT (1700 UTC), the National Hurricane Center (NHC) classified Dolly as a tropical storm. The NHC Discussion said, “A (9:48 a.m. EDT) 1348 UTC an ASCAT-A scatterometer [a satellite instrument that measures wind speed and direction] pass, arriving just after the previous advisory was issued, indicates that the cyclone is producing winds of 35 to 40 knots (40 to 46 mph/65 to 74 kph) in its southern semicircle. In addition, the radius of maximum winds has contracted to about 40 nautical miles. This, along with the current convective pattern, suggests that the system has made a transition from a subtropical to a tropical cyclone, and it has been designated as Tropical Storm Dolly.”"
drought,"More than 600 million people dependent on agriculture have been adversely affected by drought conditions across swathes of India.
Soaring temperatures since early June, averaging about 45 degrees, have stifled most of the country, while the progress of the annual monsoon rains, which normally bring relief from the searing heat and are a vital source of water, has been the slowest in 12 years.
An estimated 43 per cent of the country is affected by drought.
According to countrywide news reports, hundreds of villages and small towns in states including Uttar Pradesh in the east, Rajasthan and Maharashtra in the west and Andhra Pradesh in southern India are surrounded by parched farmland and have been deserted.
The country’s meteorological department predicts a deficient monsoon that in all likelihood may not be able to resuscitate some 91 life-sustaining reservoirs across India, where water levels in some cases are hovering at about 30 per cent capacity.
The federal government, however, has played down reports of water shortages. Addressing a press conference in New Delhi on Monday, water resources minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said media reports of the water crisis were exaggerated."
earthquake,"Quake of magnitude 7.3 hits Papua New Guinea, tsunami warning briefly issued A warning for ""hazardous tsunami waves"" was briefly issued for coastal regions within 300 kilometers of Wau in Papua New Guinea's northeast, after a 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck the region, the US Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said. The quake struck about 12.50pm local time at a depth of 85 km according to the US Geological Survey (USGS), and struck offshore 18 kms east-southeast of Wau. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center initially issued a tsunami warning but said about an hour later the danger had passed. There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage and the PNG National Disaster Centre declined to comment until it had received a briefing. Wau is an inland former gold mining town with a population of about 5,000, about 150 kms southwest of PNG's second-largest city, Lae. A person who answered the phone at the Lae City Hotel said they the had felt the quake but there was no property damage. ""It's normal, the earthquake, here. The staff is okay. They just kept on going,"" the person said. The hotel was fully booked but all the guests were out at the time of the quake, the person added."
earthquake,"A magnitude-5.0 offshore earthquake occurred in the Caribbean Sea off central Panama at around 01:13 May 1. The epicenter was about 18 km (11 miles) north of Santa Isabel in Colon Province. The tremor occurred at a depth of about 27 km (17 miles), and weak-to-light shaking was probably felt throughout central and eastern regions, including eastern Cocle, Colon, northern Darien, Guna Yala, Panama, and Panama Oeste provinces. There have been no initial reports of damage or casualties as a result of the earthquake. It could take several hours until authorities can conduct comprehensive damage assessments, especially in remote areas. Aftershocks are possible over the coming days.
Officials may temporarily shut down transportation infrastructure in the tremor zone to check for damage. Minor disruptions could occur during shutdowns, but service will likely resume quickly if no damage is found. Utility outages are possible, particularly near the earthquake's epicenter. The event has not prompted any tsunami advisories."
earthquake,"Hundreds are dead after the worst earthquake in generations struck off the northeast coast of Japan on Friday, setting off a devastating tsunami that swallowed swaths of coastal territory and fanned out across the Pacific Ocean, threatening everything in its path.
The 8.9-magnitude earthquake -- the world’s fifth-largest since 1900 and the biggest in Japan in 140 years -- struck at 2:46 p.m. local time, shaking buildings violently in Tokyo for several minutes and sending millions fleeing for higher ground.
Nearby islands are bracing for the tsunami and warnings have been issued for 53 countries including ones as far as Colombia and Peru.
The Kyodo News service reported police finding up to 300 bodies in the city of Sendai in Miyagi prefecture, a part of northeastern Japan believed to have been hit hardest by the tsunami.
The city of 1 million was struck by a wave 20 feet high, then another 33 feet high. A hotel collapsed and large ships in port were seen lying on their sides.
About 1,100 people were stranded and awaiting help in Sendai’s airport terminal, according to state-funded broadcaster NHK. The airport had no power and was dark. The runway and roads surrounding the airport were submerged under a layer of muddy water."
Typhoon,"On 24 September, Tropical Storm Nesat located 1,030 km East Northeast of Virac, Catanduanes entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility and maintained its course and strength as it moved closer to the Isabela-Aurora area. The storm intensified into a typhoon with local name “Pedring” and made landfall over the boundary of Aurora and Isabela on 27 September. On 28 September, the typhoon moved out of the country, but before that brought strong winds and rainfall, which toppled communication and power lines, trees, houses and others structures. The heavy rainfall also caused landslides and massive flooding.
Subsequently, another typhoon named “Quiel” intensified and entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility on 29 September 2011. With a maximum sustained winds of 140kph near the center with gustiness of up to 170kph, it has increased its threat to Northern Luzon. Severe Weather warnings and public storm signals have been issued to at least 13 provinces in Regions I and II. These are the same areas heavily devastated by Typhoon Nesat."
Typhoon,"Heavy rains and high winds were hitting China’s eastern coastal region Tuesday from a tropical storm weakening as it neared Shanghai.
Hagiput was a typhoon with winds blowing up to 137 kilometers (85 miles) per hour at its center when it made landfall in Zhejiang province in the early morning. At noon, the tropical storm had winds of up to 108 kph (67 mph) and was moving north at around 25 kph (16 mph), China’s National Meteorological Center said.
No major destruction or injuries have been reported. State broadcaster CCTV showed trees toppled in the Zhejiang city of Yuhuan and the fire service said a panel truck had been blown on its side by high winds early Tuesday and its driver rescued.
As of Tuesday evening, the storm center was located near the city of Shaoxing, about 160 kilometers (100 miles) south of Shanghai, according to the meteorological center’s website. Shanghai was hot and windy in the evening with sporadic showers.
Forecaster Zhang Ling told state broadcaster CCTV that the storm was continuing to weaken as it moved.
“The effects will be felt (in China) through Wednesday,” Zhang said. However, rainfall will have peaked by the end of Tuesday, she said.
China had ordered evacuations of vulnerable coastal areas in Zhejiang and Fujian provinces to the south, recalled fishing boats and suspended ferry service and some trains.
In the major Zhejiang manufacturing center of Wenzhou, south of Shanghai, authorities reported evacuating 200,000 people to shelters and recalling more than 6,000 fishing boats to port. Waves along the coast were reported at heights of 4.2 meters (14 feet).
This year’s typhoon season has been relatively mild in China, although flooding since June along its major river systems has caused scores of deaths, forced around 2 million people to be evacuated and caused more than 49 billion yuan (7 billion) in damage."
drought,"About 42% of India’s land area is facing drought, with 6% exceptionally dry--four times the spatial extent of drought last year, according to data for the week ending March 26, 2019, from the Drought Early Warning System (DEWS), a real-time drought monitoring platform.
Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Maharashtra, parts of the North-East, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Telangana are the worst hit. These states are home to 500 million people, almost 40% of the country’s population.
While the central government has not declared drought anywhere so far, the state governments of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Odisha and Rajasthan have declared many of their districts as drought-hit.
“Before monsoon, which is still far away, the next two or three months are going to be difficult in many of these regions,” Vimal Mishra, associate professor at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Gandhinagar, and the developer of DEWS, told IndiaSpend.
Failed monsoon rains are the primary reason for the current situation. The North-East monsoon, also known as ‘post-monsoon rainfall’ (October-December) that provides 10-20% of India’s rainfall, was deficient by 44% in 2018 from the long-term normal of 127.2 mm, as per data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD). This compounded the rainfall deficit in the South-West (SW) monsoon (June-September) that provides 80% of India’s rainfall, which fell short by 9.4% in 2018--close to the 10% deficit range when the IMD declares a drought.
India has experienced widespread drought every year since 2015, Mishra said, with the exception of 2017. As the El Nino--the unusual warming of the equatorial Pacific Ocean that makes Indian summers warmer and reduces rainfall--looms over the 2019 SW monsoon, pre-monsoon showers (March-May) this year have also been deficient. India has received 36% less rainfall than the long-term average between March 1 and March 28, 2019, as per IMD data. The southern peninsular region recorded the lowest, a deficit greater than 60%.
Lower rainfall has reduced water levels in reservoirs across the country. The amount of water available in the country’s 91 major reservoirs has gone down 32 percentage points over five months to March 22, 2019. In 31 reservoirs of southern states, water level has gone down by 36 percentage points over five months.
The drought could further worsen farm distress, exacerbate groundwater extraction, increase migration from rural to urban areas, and further inflame water conflicts between states and between farms, cities and industries.
Yet, the latest drought manual issued in 2016 by the central government makes the process of declaring drought long and difficult, experts say, with the result that drought may go officially unannounced. This means relief measures such as drinking water supply, subsidised diesel and electricity for irrigation, increased number of days of insured work under National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) are not taken. And elections may further delay government acknowledgement and action.
This is the first of a six-part series on drought and its impact in five affected regions--Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Rajasthan."
wildfires,"Fires continue to blanket Sumatra with haze. This image, taken on March 7, 2014, by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Aqua satellite, shows fires outlined in red. The fires burn in peat forests, which produce dense smoke when they burn. Fire detections from the MODIS sensors on both the Aqua and Terra satellites play a significant role in monitoring burning in Indonesia. This image shows around 400 fire detections, meaning that MODIS detected at least one fire in about 400 one-kilometer pixels.
According to local news reports, some of the more intense fires are burning in the Giam Siak Kecil-Bukit Batu biosphere reserve and were deliberately set to clear land for palm oil plantations. The Giam Siak Kecil-Bukit Batu biosphere reserve contains just over 700,000 hectares of peat forest that sustains a wide range of plant and animal species including the Sumatra tiger, elephant, tapir, and sun bear.
It is illegal to set fires to clear land in Indonesia, but the practice is common. The chief of the Indonesian National Disaster Mitigation Agency told ANTARA News that 99 percent of the fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan were deliberately set. Most fires occur during the dry season between April and October. The fires in 2014 started in February and have already forced Indonesia to declare a state of emergency because of poor air quality."

The national weather forecaster said Haiyan made landfall in northern province of Quang Ninh at5:00am local time_n Monday (22:00 GMT on Sunday)_s a tropical storm. It was moving towards southern China and is expected to weaken to a low depression later on Monday.
Downpours hit the capital, Hanoi, and houses in some northern provinces were damaged by strong winds.
“Several hundred houses had their roofs ripped off. Thousands of trees in the province were uprooted,” said Nguyen Cong Thuan, a disaster official in Quang Ninh province.
“Three people were reported missing,” he added.
National disaster officials said no deaths had been reported so far on Monday, although state media said five people had died during preparations for the typhoon.
Haiyan has weakened significantly since scything through the Philippines at the weekend, and had sustained winds of 120km per hour as it hit Vietnam. That was down from winds of over 300km per hour when the storm hit the Philippines, devastating Leyte and Samar provinces, as well as other areas.
More than 600,000 Vietnamese were evacuated from their homes at the weekend as Haiyan bore down on Vietnam.
The storm changed course on Sunday, prompting further mass evacuations of about 52,000 people in northern provinces by the coast.

wildfires,"One year has passed since the world was shocked by the images of the fires blazing across the Amazon in Brazil. But since then, the forest hasn’t stopped burning —and 2020 could be even more devastating for the rainforest and the Indigenous Peoples who call it home. Last week, Greenpeace Brazil flew over the state of Mato Grosso to capture images of the Amazon. Even though the government had ordered a ban on forest fires in the state starting at the beginning of July, the photos show smoke, flames, and just how ineffective the ban has been.
Last year, more than 1 million hectares of forest were burned, and the trend shows the destruction is far from over. Last June, more than two thousand fire hotspots were registered in the Amazon, the highest number in the last thirteen years. Since Brazil’s President Bolsonaro took office in January 2019, his government’s agenda has been very clear: dismantle environmental protection law and agencies, so that forest destroyers can burn the forest freely, clearing the land to turn it into pastures, without being held accountable. 
The consequences of this destruction are dire. From Siberia to the Amazon, fires are raging across the world. Losing our forests means losing the fight against the climate crisis, putting biodiversity at risk of extinction, and threatening the lives of Indigenous Peoples who depend on the forest standing for their survival. Fighting to protect the forest and Indigenous lands from fires and deforestation become even more difficult—and crucial —during a pandemic. 
With a mortality rate from COVID-19 150% higher than the Brazilian average, Indigenous Peoples are already more vulnerable during the pandemic. The smoke from the fires will put their respiratory system at even higher risk during a time when access to healthcare is limited in remote areas in the Amazon.
But things can be different. After the public’s outcry last year, there is increasing pressure on Brazil’s government. Investors, companies and governments have been signaling their concerns about the destruction of the forest and its impact on the environment, and their message is clear: they don’t want to do business with forest destroyers. Even though last week Bolsonaro announced a “fire moratorium” for 120 days, the images of Mato Grosso show how his measures have been performative and inefficient."

Typhoon,"Deaths And Missing People Reported From Tropical Depression Hanna In Mexico As Hurricane Hanna barreled through the Atlantic Ocean this weekend, Texas and Mexico both braced for calamity, but it was Mexico that saw death. According to Mexican newspaper accounts, the bodies of a 7-year-old girl and her mother were found Monday in Saltillo, near Monterrey in northeastern Mexico, after the van they were in ran out of gas and was dragged down an overflowing tributary. They were swept away by the current. Some family members escaped, according to the Mexican papers, including the girl's 11-year-old sister, who reportedly managed to survive by clinging to branches. In the border city of Reynosa, one woman reportedly died after suffering a seizure and drowning in the floodwater left by Hanna. Three children were reported missing in a nearby neighborhood, after they fell from a tree into the water. Texas saw no casualties. After Hanna — the first hurricane of the season before being downgraded to a tropical storm, and then a tropical depression — hit the southwestern part of the state on Saturday, 200,000 locations were left without power. As of Monday morning, AEP Texas reported 60,000 outages remaining. Restoring power was complicated by severe flooding in some areas that limited access to substations, the utility said. Hanna made landfall about 90 miles south of Corpus Christi on Saturday evening, before moving into Mexico. In Texas, it dropped up to 15 inches of rain in some areas and caused extensive flooding and beach erosion. The Texas State Aquarium saw minor damage — mostly debris brought in by the storm surge. And the Bob Hall Pier, a local tourist destination, was damaged for the first time in its 37-year history. A video that circulated widely on social media over the weekend purported to show a section of the southern border wall crashing down in Hanna's high winds. But U.S. Customs and Border Protection told Texas Public Radio that the video appears to be from last month, when wind gusts knocked over several border wall panels at a construction site in New Mexico. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced Sunday that the Federal Emergency Management Agency and President Trump granted the state's request for emergency disaster relief. The state prepared for impact late last week, as hospitals in the area were already strained to near-capacity with coronavirus patients. Houston's deputy director for emergency management said Hurricane Hanna was a test of the state's ability to respond to disaster while trying to limit the spread of the coronavirus. ""We'll be looking for lessons learned even from yesterday's storm — what went well, what didn't go well, how were other jurisdictions helping to jump in response?""

earthquake,"TOKYO - A ferocious tsunami spawned by one of the largest earthquakes ever recorded slammed Japan's eastern coast Friday, killing hundreds as it swept away boats, cars and homes while widespread fires burned out of control. Tsunami warnings blanketed the entire Pacific, as far away as South America, Canada, Alaska and the entire U.S. West Coast.
The magnitude 8.9 offshore quake unleashed a 23-foot tsunami and was followed by more than 50 aftershocks for hours, many of them of more than magnitude 6.0.
Japanese police say 200 to 300 bodies were found in Sendai, the closest major city to the epicenter. Earlier, police confirmed at least 60 people had been killed and 56 were missing. The death toll was likely to continue climbing given the scale of Friday's disaster; extensive search and rescue efforts were still just getting underway.
A Japanese coast guard official said a search is under way for a ship carrying 80 dock workers that was swept away by the tsunami. The vessel was washed away from a shipbuilding site in Miyagi prefecture, close to the earthquake's epicenter.
Dozens of cities and villages along a 1,300-mile stretch of coastline were shaken by violent tremors that reached as far away as Tokyo, hundreds of miles from the epicenter."

Witnesses reported strong shaking but there was no immediate word of casualties or heavy damage. The quake was centered 86 miles northwest of Montego Bay, Jamaica, and 87 miles west-southwest of Niquero, Cuba. It hit at 2:10 p.m. and the epicenter was a relatively shallow 6 miles beneath the surface. The quake could be felt strongly in Santiago, the largest city in eastern Cuba, said Belkis Guerrero, who works in a Catholic cultural center in the center of Santiago “We were all sitting and we felt the chairs move,” she said. “We heard the noise of everything moving around.” She said there was no apparent damage in the heart of the colonial city. “It felt very strong but it doesn’t look like anything happened,” she told The Associated Press. The quake also hit the Cayman Islands, leaving cracked roads and what appeared to be sewage spilling from cracked mains. There were no immediate reports of deaths, injuries or more severe damage, said Kevin Morales, editor-in-chief of the Cayman Compass newspaper. The islands see so few earthquakes that newsroom staff were puzzled when it hit, he said. “‘It was just like a big dump truck was rolling past,”‘ Morales said. “Then it continued and got more intense.”"

Typhoon,"Often the first reinsurance-linked investment manager to come out with an official statement after a catastrophe event, Swiss ILS investment manager Plenum Investments has said that it does not expect any impact to its catastrophe bond fund from Japanese Typhoon Wipha.
Typhoon Wipha struck Japan just over 24 hours ago, brushing the main island of Honshu and passing by Tokyo only around 30 miles offshore. Wipha brought typhoon force winds and tropical rainstorms to much of Japan, the storm itself was almost as large as the entire country and the Japanese meteorological association called it the largest and most powerful typhoon to strike Japan in a decade.
Japanese typhoon risks are a peril which is part of the catastrophe bond market, with a few outstanding cat bonds having exposure to the peril and thus to typhoon Wipha.
Plenum Investments said that as typhoon Wipha passed Japan it merged with a cold front and transitioned into an extratropical storm, much like Sandy did in the U.S. Wipha was much weaker though and also passed by Tokyo near to low tide which meant that storm surge damage will have been minimal.
Typhoon Wipha badly impacted some islands in the Izu cluster to the south of Tokyo, causing extensive damage and some loss of life, but damage to Tokyo and other metro areas of Japan is not expected to have been severe. Plenum notes that Japanese building codes and construction standards are designed to withstand storms of this severity meaning that only minor damages are to be expected.
Plenum Investments cat bond fund has only a limited exposure to Japan typhoon risk, of around 1.5% of the funds NAV. Due to the nature of the storm and the minimal exposure, Plenum Investments does not expect typhoon Wipha to have an adverse effect on its Japan typhoon cat bond investments."
wildfires,"Nearly three billion animals _ mammals, reptiles, birds, and frogs _ were killed or displaced by Australia’s devastating 2019-20 bushfires.
It’s almost three times an earlier estimate released in January.
The breakdown is 143 million mammals, 2.46 billion reptiles, 180 million birds, and 51 million frogs.
Those figures are revealed in an interim report entitled Australia’s 2019-2020 Bushfires: The Wildlife Toll, commissioned by the World Wide Fund for Nature and believed to be world first research.
Ten scientists from the University of Sydney, University of New South Wales, University of Newcastle, Charles Sturt University, and BirdLife Australia contributed the majority of the work.
The project is being led by Dr Lily Van Eeden and overseen by Professor Chris Dickman, both from the University of Sydney.
While results are still being finalised, the headline figure of nearly three billion animals impacted is unlikely to change.
“The interim findings are shocking. It’s hard to think of another event anywhere in the world in living memory that has killed or displaced that many animals. This ranks as one of the worst wildlife disasters in modern history,” said WWF-Australia CEO Dermot O’Gorman.
“When you think about nearly three billion native animals being in the path of the fires it is absolutely huge, it’s a difficult number to comprehend,” said Professor Dickman.
While the scientists cannot say how many animals died, Professor Dickman said the prospects for animals which escaped the flames were “probably not that great” because of a lack of food and shelter or being forced into habitat already occupied.
In January, Professor Dickman, working with WWF scientists, produced an early estimate that 1.25 billion animals were impacted. However, that calculation focused only on the states of New South Wales and Victoria.
Dr Van Eeden said for this project the team examined a fire impact area of 11.46 million hectares.
“We believe a continent-wide assessment of the number of animals that might be impacted has never been done in Australia before or anywhere else in the world. Other nations can build upon this research to improve understanding of bushfire impacts everywhere,” Dr Van Eeden said.
Mr O’Gorman said with extreme fires becoming more frequent because of climate change the interim findings “give other countries a window into the future of mega fires and their devastating impact on wildlife”.
He said the research had also been released in time to be considered by the review of Australia’s flagship environment law _ the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act.
“Following such a heavy toll on Australia’s wildlife, strengthening this law has never been more important. WWF will continue to advocate for policies that benefit both people and nature, restore what has been lost, and ensure we build back a more resilient Australia,” Mr O’Gorman said.
Professor Dickman said the research shows people that mega fires are changing the environment and depleting native biodiversity and change is necessary.
“How quickly can we decarbonise? How quickly can we stop our manic land clearing? We land clear at a rate that’s one of the highest in the world,” Professor Dickman said.
The recommendations in the interim report call for addressing knowledge gaps on wildlife densities and responses to fire, improving habitat connectivity to help mobile species escape fire, identifying and protecting unburnt habitat crucial to threatened species, improving fire prevention and management, and establishing rapid response teams to help species impacted by fire.
It's anticipated that the final report will be completed by the end of August 2020."
earthquake,"Powerful earthquake shakes southern Mexico, at least 5 dead MEXICO CITY (AP) — A powerful earthquake centered near the southern Mexico resort of Huatulco on Tuesday killed at least five people, swayed buildings in Mexico City and sent thousands fleeing into the streets. Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said one person was killed in a building collapse in Huatulco, Oaxaca. Otherwise he said reports were of minor damage from the magnitude 7.4 quake, including broken windows and collapsed walls. Oaxaca Gov. Alejandro Murat said a second person was killed in an apparent house collapse in the mountain village of San Juan Ozolotepec and a third died in circumstances he did not explain. Federal civil defense authorities reported two more deaths: a worker at the state-run oil company, Pemex, fell to his death from a refinery structure, and a man died in the Oaxaca village of San Agustin Amatengo when a wall fell on him. Pemex also said the quake caused a fire at its refinery in the Pacific coast city of Salina Cruz, relatively near the epicenter. It said one worker was injured and the flames were quickly extinguished. Churches, bridges and highways also suffered damage during the quake. López Obrador said there had been more than 140 aftershocks, most of them small. Seismic alarms sounded midmorning with enough warning for residents to exit buildings. Power was knocked out to some areas. Helicopters flew over downtown Mexico City and police patrols sounded their sirens. Groups of people still milled around in close proximity on streets and sidewalks in some neighborhoods of the capital about an hour after the quake. Many were not wearing masks despite past appeals from municipal officials for them to do so as a way to curb the spread of the new coronavirus."

wildfires,"A wildfire in Florida has claimed the lives of two forest rangers, as emergency services continue to battle more than 400 blazes across the state.
The rangers had been trying contain a 12-acre (4.8-ha) blaze near the Georgia border, but the fire flared up and trapped them, officials said.
Two others were injured trying to save Josh Burch, 31, and Brett Fulton, 52.
The news comes as responders continue to battle thousands of fires in regions of Arizona, Texas and New Mexico.
The fire in which the rangers died - the Blue Ribbon Fire in Florida's Hamilton County - was burning roughly 85 miles (136 km) north-east of the city of Tallahassee and had previously been considered contained.
""The wildfires have ravaged our state, burning more than 200,000 acres, and now, they have taken the lives of two of our very own men,"" Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam said in a statement.
The deaths mark the first time anyone working for the Florida Division of Forestry has died from fighting a blaze since 2000, when a helicopter pilot crashed after dumping water on a wildfire near the town of Fort Myers."
Typhoon,"Storm-weary Louisiana is once again under a hurricane warning, with Zeta leaving Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula on a path that could hit New Orleans Wednesday night.
Zeta, the 27th named storm in a very busy Atlantic season, made landfall just north of the ancient Mayan city of Tulum with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph (130 kph). It weakened to a tropical storm as it crossed over land, but it was expected to regain its strength over the Gulf of Mexico.
Zeta’s top winds were 70 mph (110 kmh) early Tuesday, centered about 560 miles (905 kmh) south of the mouth of the Mississippi River. If Zeta makes landfall in Louisiana, it will be the fifth named storm to hit the state this year, joining Cristobal, Laura, Marco and Delta."

wildfires,"The number of wildfires and acres burned in Alaska in June 2015 has exceeded what the state saw during the same month in 2004, a year considered the worst for wildfires in the state.
According to the Alaska DNR - Division of Forestry, a combined 1.6 million acres have been burned by 399 separate fires in the state this month through June 29. That is nearly double the number of fires in June 2004, which had 215 wildfires that charred 1.15 million acres.
The Associated Press reported that 314 wildfires remained active over more than 2,265 square miles as of Monday. No new evacuations occurred this past weekend, however residents in some small communities left in voluntary evacuations last week, including elders, children and those that were medically vulnerable.
Most of the fires in June 2004 were located in Alaska's interior, while this June they have been scattered throughout the state, Alaska DNR said. They added that it was unusual to have this concentration of fire starts.
Lightning strikes were a major contributor to the ignition of wildfires in both June 2015 and June 2004. However, Alaska DNR says that June 2015 has had much more lightning than June 2004. In a span of three days from June 21-23, 2015, about 50,000 lightning strikes were recorded across the state.
The largest wildfire in the state is the Iditarod River Fire, which had burned 98,183 acres through June 28. That wildfire and the other top 10 largest wildfires in Alaska through June 28 were all started by lightning strikes."

The epicenter was located in the Caribbean Sea about 83 miles north of Montego Bay, the capital of St. James, and about 87 miles south of Granma, Cuba, according to the United States Geological Survey service. It was a relatively strong but shallow quake with a depth of about 6 miles. A 7.7 magnitude earthquake is at the high end of the Richter Scale. It was initially reported at 7.3 but was quickly revised up to 7.7. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damages. Residents as far as Miami said they felt tremors from the powerful quake. Robert Lee, who was working on the 25th floor of the Miami Tower in Downtown Miami at the time, said he could feel the building ""swaying back and forth."" ""It was crazy!

Pacific, no Pacific-wide tsunami threat A magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck in the vicinity of New Caledonia on Thursday, triggering a tsunami warning for countries and territories in the South Pacific but no destructive Pacific-wide tsunami is expected. The powerful quake, which struck at 12:20 a.m. local time at a location southeast of the Loyalty Islands, had a relatively shallow depth of 10 kilometers, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The Hawaii-based Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said that ""based on all available data a destructive Pacific-wide tsunami is not expected."" But it warned that ""hazardous tsunami waves from this earthquake are possible"" along the coasts of such places as New Caledonia, Vanuatu, Fiji, New Zealand, Tonga and the Solomon Islands. Japan's Pacific coastal areas from Hokkaido to Okinawa may observe slight sea-level changes, possibly beginning around 6 a.m., due to the impact of the quake, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. Although the effect could continue for around 24 hours, it is unlikely to cause any damage, the agency added."

wildfires,"While the summer can mean warm weather, swimsuits, and sunshine, it can also mean wildfire season for parts of North America. And so far, the 2015 wildfire season has been a damaging one across the Pacific Northwest, western Canada, and Alaska in June and July.
In the far north, Alaska’s 2015 wildfire season tally is already over 700 fires, ranking it ninth in history.  (The typical fire season ends during August.) The fires have burned nearly 5 million acres, the fourth largest total already and only 200,000 acres away from #2 in the rankings.  For perspective, the state’s largest wildfire season on record, 2004, saw 6.5 million acres burned in 701 fires. This year is already at 708 fires which have burned or are burning around 4.8 million acres (numbers as of July 22 from Alaska’s division of Forestry). Fires have destroyed dozens of buildings, and several communities required partial evacuations during June.
Farther south in western/central Canada, wildfires have burned through extensive areas. In an average year, Canada sees around 8,000 fires, which burn around 8,100 square miles. As of July 22, according to the Canadian National Forestry Database, 5,603 fires have burned almost 15,000 square miles of land. That total is larger than the state of Maryland."

Officials warned it could become a hurricane by the time it passes the southwest side of Puerto Rico on Wednesday.
Hundreds of people in Puerto Rico have been stocking up on supplies at supermarkets and fuel stations in preparation for the storm."
drought,"Some parts of the Horn of Africa have been hit by the worst drought in 60 years, the UN says.
More than 10 million people are thought to be affected across the region.
The UN now classifies large areas of Somalia, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Kenya as a crisis or an emergency.
Charity Save the Children says drought and war in Somalia has led to unprecedented numbers fleeing across the border into Kenya, with about 1,300 people arriving every day.
Three camps at Dadaab, just inside Kenya, are home to well over 350,000 people, but they were built to hold just 90,000 and are severely overcrowded.
A prolonged failure of rains, which began in late 2010, is now taking its toll.
The UN's Office for the Co-Ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) warns that the situation is continuing to deteriorate, and the number of people in need will continue to increase.
The numbers now affected are huge, Ohca says: 3.2m in Ethiopia, 3.2m in Kenya, 2.6m in Somalia and more than 100,000 in Djibouti.
Every month during 2011, about 15,000 Somalis have fled their country, arriving in Kenya and Ethiopia, according to Ocha.
While conflict has been a fact of life for them for years, it is the drought that has brought them to breaking point. Many have walked for days, are exhausted, in poor health, desperate for food and water.
The UN refugee agency is dealing with the exodus.
A new refugee camp primarily for Somalis was opened at Kobe in Ethiopia last Friday, near an existing camp at Melkadida.
More than 3,500 refugees and their belongings were moved there over the weekend.
The UNHCR says this is the sixth camp for Somalis in Ethiopia, which is currently housing some 130,000 displaced people.
Food prices have risen substantially across the region, pushing many moderately poor households over the edge.
The price of grain in affected areas in Kenya is 30-80% above average.
The spokeswoman for Ocha, Elizabeth Byrs, said appeals for Somalia and Kenya, each about 525m (328m), are barely 50% funded, while a 30m appeal for Djibouti has raised just 30% of the needed funds."

But initial reports nearest the epicenter indicated a wave of less than a foot. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. Alaska Public Media reports that residents from Homer to Unalaska moved to higher ground after the Aleutian earthquake, which the U.S. Geological Survey said struck around 10:12 p.m. local time (2:12 a.m. ET) about 75 miles south of Chignik. Sand Point, the first community in line of a potential tsunami reported only a ""very small"" wave, just after 11 p.m., James Gridley, the director of NOAA's National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, told AKPM. He estimated the wave at about 10 inches (about 25 centimeters). Gridley said it was too soon to say what Kodiak and Cold Bay may see but ""likely small if we're already seeing small at Sand Point."" ""We're not expecting a massive wave anywhere,"" he said. Although it was subsequently lifted, a tsunami warning had been issued shortly after the quake for South Alaska, the Alaska Peninsula from Kennedy Entrance to Unimak and the Aleutian Islands from Unimak Pass to Samalga Pass.

""And that might be all we're going to get for the year.""
He is standing in a dry river bed that stretches for hundreds of metres through his property near Kempsey.
It's usually full of water where his cattle drink.

""We've had dry periods — you know, it might be dry for three or four months.
""But it's been dry for 12 months here and the big concern is we've just been through our wet period of the calendar year.""
To help make ends meet, all five members of the Saul family have taken on extra jobs outside the farm.
""We've all still got loans to pay and the bank needs their money,"" Mr Saul said.
""So, we've got to have an income coming in.""
He has been doing extra work driving cattle trucks, but he also has to keep the farm ticking over.
Which makes for long days.

Fishermen and ships were warned not to venture out to sea.
Typhoon Bopha is expected to hit land Tuesday morning but would not directly hit Manila if it stays on its current path, government weather forecaster Jori Loiz said.
The storm has sustained winds of 175 kilometers per hour (109 miles per hour) and gusts of up to 210 kph (130 mph). Its center was 550 kilometers (342 miles) southeast of Surigao del Sur province's Hinatuan township Monday morning. It is moving at 24 kph (15 mph).
Hundreds of residents of islands and other high-risk areas in Surigao del Sur have been asked to go to evacuation centers to avert casualties, Office of Civil Defense regional official Amado Posas said. Classes have been suspended, dump trucks have been readied to ferry more residents when needed, he added.
Posas said some residents have been reluctant to leave their homes because the province was sunny Monday morning. It was not yet clear how many have already evacuated, but he said an estimated 600 to 800 people were ordered to evacuate from islands in the archipelago nation.
Benito Ramos, who heads the government's disaster response agency, says provincial officials have placed food packs and other emergency equipment in areas where the typhoon may pass."
wildfires,"Green leaves have popped out on trees throughout interior Alaska, but the dry vegetation below is putting wildfire responders on edge.
Grasses still brown from a lack of spring rain, combined with high temperatures and low humidity, have made the region a tinderbox. The Yukon Flats, the Tanana River Valley and the Copper River Basin remain under “red flag” alerts and burn bans because of the high danger of fire.
“We still have a lot of dead, dry grass that could burn,” said Tim Mowry, information officer at the Alaska Interagency Coordination Center in Fairbanks. A meteorologist described the conditions as “an insanely dry air mass sitting on top of us,” Mowry said.
Temperatures this week edged into the high 70s and low 80s with low humidity, evaporating precious moisture from already dry undergrowth. The conditions are expected to last into Memorial Day weekend.
The same weather system is drying out southcentral Alaska and even making coastal rainforest on the Panhandle susceptible to forest fire, Mowry said.
In the last decade, an average of 1,875 square miles of forest has burned annually in Alaska. Many of the largest fires started by lighting in remote areas.
The state so far has recorded 27 wildfires, including nine still active, but they’ve covered only 5.3 square miles.
They include the Bolgen Creek Fire covering almost 1 square mile along the Steese Highway between Circle and Central. Fire officials reported Wednesday afternoon that the 179 people assigned to the fire had it 60 percent contained.
The Seaton Roadhouse Fire, burning on both sides of the Alaska Highway about 50 miles northwest of the Canada border, on Thursday was estimated at nearly 500 acres, or just under 1 square mile.
Traffic on the state’s highway to Lower 48 states was slowed to about 10 mph through a half-mile section of highway, and a pilot car led motorists through smoke.
The state Division of Forestry responded with aircraft — a water-scooping airplane, three retardant tankers and a helicopter dropping water — plus six ground crews.
All but one 2015 fire were caused by humans."

The report released Tuesday and commissioned by the World Wide Fund for Nature Australia said more than 46 million acres were scorched. An estimate in January said 1.25 billion animals were affected.
""This ranks as one of the worst wildlife disasters in modern history,” Dermot O’Gorman, the organization's chief executive officer, said in a statement. ""It’s hard to think of another event anywhere in the world in living memory that has killed or displaced that many animals.""
Ten researchers from Australian universities and wildlife groups involved in the report have been looking at both the impact of the fires and the possible ways to protect ecosystems in the future.
The affected wildlife includes 143 million mammals, 2.46 billion reptiles, 180 million birds and 51 million frogs.
""It's almost impossible to comprehend how many individuals that actually means,"" Lily van Eeden, a researcher at the University of Sydney and a co-author of the report, told NBC News.
The jump in the estimated animals affected compared to the January report is due to a wider geographic area being studied and new data on wildlife, she said.
Despite the increased scope of the research, Van Eeden cautioned, the estimate is still ""quite conservative.""
Invertebrate species — such as spiders and butterflies — were not included and neither was a range of wildlife that lives in waterways like turtles."
Typhoon,"As per forecasts discussed in our blog last week, Cyclone Phailin struck the east coast of India over the weekend with winds estimated at near 130 mph.
It brought a strong storm surge along the coast and more than 230 mm (9 inches) of rain was recorded as the cyclone passed.
The cyclone was of a similar strength to one which struck just a little further up the coast in 1999, which claimed more than 10,000 lives.
Excellent forecasts for Phailin, combined with well executed warning and evacuation procedures, meant the loss of life was much less this time around.
Phailin became a tropical storm a little more than three days before landfall, but computer models were able to give far greater warning than this.
Medium range prediction models suggested a higher risk of cyclone formation in the Bay of Bengal a full nine days before Cyclone Phailin struck.
At six days ahead, shorter range models were predicting that the north-eastern coast of India could be under threat, although the timing was not certain at that stage.
Four days ahead, computer models were able to pinpoint the location and timing of landfall to a high degree of accuracy _ all before the storm was strong enough to be named.
Cyclone Phailin originated from a disturbance in the far west Pacific basin and was one of a series of tropical storms seen in this region recently."
wildfires,"In Big Basin State Park south of San Francisco — may be a holdover from the fire 9 months ago
On Monday firefighters suppressed a fire that burned within the perimeter of the CZU Lightning Complex of fires. The blaze was in Big Basin Redwoods State Park south of San Francisco and could be a holdover from the 86,502-acre blaze from August, 2020.
When firefighters hiked into the fire it was less than two acres, but with the assistance of aircraft they stopped the spread after it burned about seven acres.
In January several other holdover fires were found in the footprint of the same fire.
There is a chance that considering the numerous very large fires that spread through California and Oregon last year, and with lower than normal precipitation during the winter, other similar holdover fires will be discovered. In many cases since they are within the burn perimeter, they may not be a serious problem. But if they are in a large unburned island, burning embers lofted into the air could ignite spot fires some distance away, perhaps outside the perimeter where there is an abundance of available fuel."
Typhoon,"Hurricane Iota has made landfall in Nicaragua as a Category 4 storm, with the Central American region bracing for the possibility of catastrophic damage.
Iota crossed into Nicaragua near the town of Haulover, approximately 15 miles south of where Hurricane Eta also struck as a Category 4 on Nov. 3.
Nicaragua, along with Honduras, Guatemala, and southern Belize, which are flanked by the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean, are still trying to recover from the widespread devastation caused by Hurricane Eta, which left tens of thousands homeless.
At the time, Eta was the strongest storm to ever hit Nicaragua in the month of November.
The National Hurricane Center has warned of ""catastrophic winds, life-threatening storm surge, and torrential rainfall"" across Central America from the latest storm.
When it made landfall, Iota had sustained winds of 155 mph _ a Category 4 hurricane, but by 4 a.m. ET, it had lost strength, becoming a Category 2 storm, with winds at 105 mph, according to the U.S.-based National Hurricane Center. The storm was centered about 10 miles east-northeast of El Pia, Nicaragua. Before making landfall, Iota reached Category 5 for a time.
Besides Iota's incredible strong winds — expected to rip apart roofs and shatter some buildings completely — it is also bringing a massive storm surge, rain and flooding. Water is always the biggest killer in any tropical event and this will be no exception; Iota is a ""bigger"" storm than Eta in terms of how wide the windfield is. That means more people will feel the effects of the storm."

Experts called it a “huge explosion” that generated pyroclastic flows down the volcano’s south and southwest flanks. “It’s destroying everything in its path,” Erouscilla Joseph, director of the University of the West Indies’ Seismic Research Center, told The Associated Press. “Anybody who would have not heeded the evacuation, they need to get out immediately.”"
earthquake,"BANGOR, Maine — Residents from all over Maine and New England felt the effects of an earthquake measuring 4.0 on the Richter scale with an epicenter in Hollis Center, Maine, on Tuesday evening.
“I literally thought my furnace was exploding,” said Portland resident and Brewer native Holly Barber, a guidance counselor at Lake Region High School in Naples. “I live in Deering Center on Pleasant Avenue, and I was right here in my room.”
The quake was centered 3 miles west of Hollis Center and 13 miles northwest of Biddeford, according to the United States Geological Survey, and was just over 4 miles deep. The service notes the quake occurred at 7:12 p.m. Tuesday.
eports of the quake spread like wildfire through social media. A Facebook group created shortly after it struck, called “I survived the 10/16/12 earthquake,” was liked by more than 38,000 people by approximately 8:20 p.m. On Twitter, users reported feeling the tremors from around the state.
While there were no immediate reports of physical damage, some users reported problems with cellphone providers AT&T and Verizon Wireless and phone provider Time Warner after the quake.
The Maine Emergency Management Agency had no immediate reports of damage or injuries."
earthquake,"An earthquake measuring a preliminary magnitude of 6.0 struck Thursday in waters off the south coast of Panama, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
The quake was recorded around 9:42 GMT Thursday at a depth of 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) under the northern Pacific Ocean, some 150 kilometers (93 miles) southeast of Punta de Burica, Panama.
The USGS said little or no population was exposed to the quake. No tsunami warning has been issued.
No other details were immediately available."
Typhoon,"MANILA — Super Typhoon Goni, the world's most powerful storm in four years, crashed through the Philippines on Sunday, smashing buildings, toppling trees, and causing floods and mudslides. At least 10 people were reported dead as of Monday morning.
Peak winds were estimated at 195 mph early Sunday before Goni slammed into Catanduanes Island, home to more than 260,000 people. Those winds, equivalent to those of a strong Category 5 hurricane, made the storm comparable to Super Typhoon Haiyan, the catastrophic cyclone that devastated Tacloban City in the Philippines in 2013 and killed more than 6,000 people. The winds were similar to those of Typhoon Meranti, which struck the Philippines in 2016.
Goni landed in a country already reeling from two typhoons in the past two weeks, the coronavirus pandemic, a recession and a record unemployment rate this year."
Typhoon,"A typhoon approaching Japan could bring heavy rains to the Tokyo region over the weekend, weather officials said Thursday, urging residents to take precautions early.
Typhoon Chan-hom was 260 kilometers (160 miles) southeast of Japan’s southern island of Tanegashima on Thursday evening with maximum winds of 126 kilometers (78 miles) per hour, the Meteorological Agency said.
Chan-hom, a kind of tree in Laotian, could bring heavy rain and wind to western Japan as early as Friday and to eastern Japan, including Tokyo, over the weekend, officials said.
The agency urged residents to prepare early for high waves and possible flooding from the storm."
wildfires,"Calmer winds and cooler temperatures are aiding firefighters battling blazes in Southern California today, with arson being investigated as a possible cause.
But the fires continue to burn, with at least one person dead and more than 10,000 acres scorched. Conditions remain problematic, as the entire state is experiencing drought conditions, leaving dry brush to fuel the flames.
It’s unclear how many houses have been damaged. Investigators are still trying to figure out what caused the fires.
“We all have suspicions like the public does when we have nine fires that started all over the county,” San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore said. “We are actively investigating the start of those fires.”
A 19-year-old and 17-year-old were arrested Thursday, accused of starting a pair of smaller fires in Escondido. But authorities say those fires were quickly extinguished, and authorities don’t believe there is any connection to the larger fires that remain burning.
Firefighters found a body in a transient camp Thursday. The body was so badly burned that officials have been unable to make a positive identification."
wildfires,"Drought conditions out West have combined with strong winds and triple-digit heat to spark a particularly devastating wildfire season.
Here, a firefighter works to save a residence as the Butte fire burns in San Andreas, California, September 11, 2015. Evacuation orders were expanded to thousands of homes in northern California's Sierras that day, as the rapidly spreading wildfire roared through drought-parched timber and brush, threatening mountain communities near Sacramento. As of September 11th, the flames had devoured nearly 32,000 acres."
drought,"The spectre of drought looms over the country almost as a certainty like the annual floods. This year large swathes of almost all central Indian states are reeling under severe water scarcity. Much beyond the news reports, statistics and the weather graphs, the drought is a calamity that unfolds in the anguish of people struggling for water. India Today sent its team of photographers deep into the drought-affected districts of the country to capture the widespread severity of the situation - what they have photographed goes beyond the routine imagery of cracked earth and dried river beds - these are images that show how the drought is lived through.

Last summer's bushfires, which Prime Minister Scott Morrison has dubbed Australia's ""black summer,"" also killed 33 people and razed over 24 million hectares (59 million acres) in the country.
Nearly 3 billion native animals would have been in the path of the bushfires, the WWF study said."

The temblor, which occurred at 7:34 p.m. local time, was centered at 44.7 degrees north latitude and 148.9 degrees east longitude with a depth of 160 km. The quake logged 4 in some parts of Hokkaido Prefecture on the Japanese seismic intensity scale which peaks at 7. So far no tsunami warning has been issued."
drought,"On June 5, it drizzled for about ten minutes over most of Marathwada in India’s western state of Maharashtra. That made headlines in the local media, because it was the first time since August 17, 2018, that anyone had seen a drop of rain in this region, the epicentre of the drought that is now afflicting almost half of India.
Two days earlier, Sakharam Landge was ploughing his farm near Umarkheda village in Jalna district. It was 42 degrees Celsius in the shade, a hot wind was blowing away the topsoil his tractor churned up, and he was not sure he would be able to sow any crop this summer. “But what else can I do,” he said. “My grandfather, my father, all the elders in the village said we must plough our farms in the first half of June, so that we can sow our Kharif (summer) crop as soon as the rains arrive on June 15.”
A farmer in his early forties, Landge is perfectly aware that the monsoon rains have not been arriving on June 15 in recent years. Of the 18 summer monsoons this millennium in Marathwada _ a region where the overwhelming majority of farmers have no irrigation facilities _ ten have caused droughts and one a flood. As the monsoon winds bring rainfall from the Arabian Sea to India’s west coast, Marathwada is also in the rain shadow of the Western Ghats _ a mountain chain along the coast _ and has always been a low rainfall area.
However, it is also home to the famously productive ‘black cotton soil’ of the Deccan Plateau. In a good rainfall year, cotton and soybean _ the two staple crops of the region in recent decades _ bring enough money to see an average farming family through for the next couple of years as well. But apart from 2016, no one has any recent memory of a good rainfall year in this region with a population of about 18.7 million people, most of whom are farmers."

The ash cloud is moving east from St. Vincent with ash fall reported as far southeast as Argyle International Airport, which is located approximately 12 miles away. Heavy ash fall with poor visibility is reported in the evacuation zone, and the Seismic Research Center at the University of the West Indies (UWI) reports the ash column is falling back down around the volcano and surrounding area. Communities across mainland St. Vincent will experience varying degrees of ashfall. The Grenadines may also be affected. Mandatory evacuation for all residents in the red zone continues.

earthquake,"A magnitude 6.1 earthquake shook Alaska's Talkeetna Mountains north of Anchorage Sunday night and smaller tremors continued early Monday.
The earthquake was felt from Homer to Fairbanks, and was felt especially strongly in the Anchorage and Wasilla areas, the Anchorage Daily News reported. Some people described items falling off shelves and many described rolling motion.
There were no immediate reports of injuries or major damage.
The Alaska Earthquake Center reported the quake had a depth of about 27 miles (44 kilometers). Its epicenter was about 60 miles (96 kilometers) east of Talkeetna, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) northeast of Anchorage.
A magnitude 4.6 aftershock struck at about 4:14 a.m. Monday and about a dozen small quakes measuring 3.0 or smaller continue to rattle the area.
It was the largest earthquake to strike southcentral Alaska since the magnitude 7.1 quake in November 2018, the Alaska News Source reported. That quake caused major infrastructure damage across Anchorage, with damage to many homes and buildings and closures for roads and bridges. There were no reports of deaths.
There have been more than a dozen similarly sized, or larger quakes that have struck the Aleutians since the 2018 temblor."
Typhoon,"Powerful Hurricane Iota made landfall on Nicaragua’s Caribbean coast late Monday, threatening catastrophic damage to the same part of Central America already battered by equally strong Hurricane Eta less than two weeks ago.
Iota had intensified into an extremely dangerous Category 5 storm early in the day, but the U.S. National Hurricane Center said it weakened slightly to Category 4, with maximum sustained winds of 155 mph (250 kph). Its center made landfall about 30 miles (45 kilometers) south of the Nicaraguan city of Puerto Cabezas, also known as Bilwi.
Iota already had been hitting the Caribbean coasts of Nicaragua and Honduras with torrential rains and strong winds.
Iota came ashore just 15 miles (25 kilometers) south of where Hurricane Eta made landfall Nov. 3, also as a Category 4 storm. Eta’s torrential rains saturated the soil in the region, leaving it prone to new landslides and floods, and that the storm surge could reach 15 to 20 feet (4.5 to 6 meters) above normal tides.
In Bilwi, business owner Adán Artola Schultz braced himself in the doorway of his house as strong gusts of wind and rain drover water in torrents down the street. He watched in amazement as wind ripped away the metal roof structure from a substantial two-story home and blew it away like paper.
“It is like bullets,” he said of the sound of metal structures banging and buckling in the wind. “This is double destruction,” he said, referring to the damages wrought by Eta just 12 days earlier.
“This is coming in with fury,” said Artola Schultz.
Storm surge was on the mind of Yasmina Wriedt in Bilwi’s seaside El Muelle neighborhood.
“The situation doesn’t look good at all,” Wriedt said earlier in the day. “We woke up without electricity, with rain and the surf is getting really high.”"

Warning sirens sounded across Noumea as authorities ordered evacuations amid fears that waves of up to 3m were headed towards the French territory. ""People must leave beach areas and stop all water activities, and should not pick their children up at schools to avoid creating traffic jams,"" emergency services spokesman Alexandre Rosignol told public radio. In New Zealand, communities along stretches of the North Island were warned to flee as tsunami alert sirens wailed after an 8.1-magnitude quake, which followed earlier tremors in the same region measuring 7.4 and 7.2."

As of January 18, 84 people have been reported killed and 932 injured. More than 40,000 people are directly affected and displaced, with many now housed in 10 evacuation sites.i The largest evacuation site is Mankarra Stadium in nearby Mamuju where it is estimated more than 10,000 people are currently being sheltered. Project HOPE’s Emergency Response Team (ERT) reports that since some of the region’s health facilities were built in low lying, coastal areas, the population is concerned about visiting them. Health teams establishing themselves following the earthquake have opted for operations on higher ground due to concerns of additional earthquakes and the potential for tsunamis. Health care teams are also primarily establishing outdoor clinics due to concern over the stability of buildings. In addition to injuries as a direct result of the earthquake, the ERT has received reports of health need including hypertension, dyspepsia, neuropathy, fevers and other cold symptoms."

drought,"Residents call this drought-stricken community a “forgotten town.”
The flat, dusty roads to Vosburg are surrounded by withered fields. The streams feeding the community of a few thousand people have gone dry. Signs warn drivers of wandering cattle and sheep but there are none in sight.
The months-long drought is affecting most of southern Africa. The United Nations estimates that more than 11 million people now face crisis levels of food insecurity in places like Zimbabwe and Mozambique, where two cyclones wiped out crops earlier this year.
Among the hardest hit areas is South Africa’s Northern Cape province, where many farmers are struggling to keep their families and animals alive while revenue falls and debt piles up.
Commercial sheep farmer Louis van der Merwe, 64, broke down as he described losing more than 400 sheep and 450 springboks in the past two years because of the worst drought he has seen in 45 years of farming.
Some animals died of hunger. Others were sent prematurely to the slaughterhouse to reduce the number to feed. With tears running down his face, Van der Merwe said he now relies on donations of animal feed so the rest can survive.
“If we didn’t have hope, we would not be here anymore,” he said. “We have to have hope and faith. There are a couple of times when we have felt it is not worth it.”
Two of his fellow farmers have killed themselves due to the stress, Van der Merwe said.
Northern Cape province will need over 28 million in drought relief over the next three months to assist 15,500 affected farms, according to farmers’organization Agri-SA.
So far, South Africa’s government has pledged 2 million.
The World Food Program says southern Africa has received normal rainfall in just one of the past five growing seasons, with small-scale farmers feeling it most.
Some like 55-year-old Gertruida Buffel, have resorted to sharing their own food with their animals.
For two weeks she had fed two tiny lambs a mixture of maize meal and water after their mother starved to death. When The Associated Press arrived at her home, she had just learned that one had died."
Typhoon,"_ giant typhoon, churning with winds of more than 230 mph, descended on the central Philippines this morning, killing at least four people and leaving thousands more homeless and without electricity.
The speed of the storm may have ultimately been the country's salvation, as Typhoon Haiyan quickly blew across the island nation rather than sitting over land to wreak havoc.
The typhoon_ade landfall at 4:40 a.m. local time near Guiuan, on the Philippine island of Samar, about 405 miles southeast of the country's capital, Manila.
At least four people have been killed, according to local media. Two people were electrocuted in storm-related accidents, one person was killed by a fallen tree, and another was struck by lightning.
More than 748,000 people have already been evacuated to the 644 evacuation centers across the country. Government officials said more than 3,000 are stranded in ports.
The U.S. Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Center said shortly before the typhoon made landfall that its maximum sustained winds were 195 mph, with gusts up to 235 mph.
The world's strongest recorded hurricane, typhoon or cyclone to previously make landfall was Hurricane Camille of 1969, which roared ashore with 190 mph winds in Mississippi. Haiyan's sustained winds easily make it a category 5 hurricane.
The Philippines government weather bureau said Haiyan had sustained winds of 147 miles per hour, with gusts of 170 mph when it made landfall."

Chosun Central News Agency reported on the approach of ‘Typhoon Bolaven’ this afternoon, saying, “Typhoon-15 is now moving northwestward at a velocity of 12km/h, as of 09:00 Thursday.”
“It is expected to come to the sea off Shanghai, China on around August 27th and move northward along the west coastal area of Korea before reaching the Chinese northeastern region on the evening of August 28th. The typhoon-15 will trigger strong wind and heavy rains in overall areas of Korea on August 27th and 28th,” the brief report added.
According to South Korea’s meteorological authorities, meanwhile, Typhoon Bolaven was 460km south of Sogwipo, the largest city on the south coast of Jeju Island, at 12PM today, moving at 34km/h in a north-northwesterly direction. It appears set to make landfall over Hwanghae Province in North Korea late on the afternoon of the 28th.
With that particular region only just recovering from serious flooding, the typhoon is likely to be an unwelcome, and damaging, addition to what has been a difficult summer."

Shaking was felt in the capital Port Moresby but not strongly. The U.S. Geological Survey said the 7.0 magnitude quake was 80 kilometers (53 miles) deep. Shallower quakes tend to cause more surface damage. The epicenter was close to Morobe Patrol Post, with a population of 15,000 in Morobe province. Locals reported on social media the wharf at Morobe Patrol Post had “cracked in half."" Some damage was reported on social media in coastal villages. Residents were advised to go inland if there were any sign of tidal changes or irregular ocean patterns. Mark Maniaol, a hotel employee in Lae, the capital of Morobe and the country's second-largest city, said he left the quake but it was not severe. He was not aware of any damage in the city. The Morobe Provincial Disaster Office Director Charley Masange said he did not expect to receive damage reports from the epicenter until Saturday. “The epicenter is in the mountains. Not many people live there and it's very remote so it takes a long time to get information,” Manage said. “I'm not expecting major damage.”"
wildfires,"The vicious 2012 wildfire season now unfolding in the interior West is hardly a surprise. Much of the region has been in a drought for more than a decade. This winter’s snowpack was sparse, particularly in Colorado, and it melted and ran off early. Temperatures have been high, and humidity has been low—making fuels from grasses to trees very dry and flammable.
All of that means conditions ripe for fires, which have come with a vengeance. New Mexico has had its biggest fire ever, and Colorado has seen the most destructive fires in its history, with the Waldo Canyon Fire near Colorado Springs and the High Park Fire near Fort Collins destroying more than 600 homes combined. Even as firefighters have brought the big Colorado fires near containment, other large blazes have broken out in Wyoming, Utah, and Montana.
Yes, it’s looking like a big fire year. And yes, this is part of the new normal. It’s pretty much exactly what climate experts have been predicting and what the data have been telegraphing for some time. While there are various proposals on the table to deal with increasingly destructive wildfires, they are likely to continue and become worse unless we tackle climate change."

One person died in Lumajang after being hit by a falling boulder, news website Detik.com said, citing a town disaster official.
There had been aftershocks but there was no risk of tsunami, Indonesian geophysics agency BMKG said.
Reports of damage included parliamentary buildings, a school, a hospital and houses in several cities, while a large gorilla statue in an amusement park in the town of Batu lost its head.
The national disaster agency said authorities were still taking stock of the damage.
The quake struck in the Indian Ocean 91 km (57 miles) off the southern coast of East Java. It had a magnitude of 5.9 at a depth of 96 km, the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre said, after initially saying the magnitude was 6.8.

wildfires,"One of the most devastating wildfire outbreaks in Texas history left more than 1,000 homes in ruins Tuesday and stretched the state's firefighting ranks to the limit, confronting Gov. Rick Perry with a major disaster at home just as the GOP presidential contest heats up. More than 180 fires have erupted in the past week across the rain-starved Lone Star State, and nearly 600 of the homes destroyed since then were lost in one catastrophic blaze in and around Bastrop, near Austin, that raged out of control Tuesday for a third day.
Whipped into an inferno by Tropical Storm Lee's winds over the weekend, the blaze burned more than 45 square miles, forced the evacuation of thousands and killed at least two people, bringing the overall death toll from the outbreak to at least four. ""We lost everything,"" said Willie Clements, whose two-story colonial home in a housing development near Bastrop was reduced to a heap of metal roofing and ash. A picket fence was melted. Some goats and turkeys survived, but about 20 chickens and ducks were burned to death in a coop that went up in flames. On Tuesday, Clements and his family took a picture of themselves in front of a windmill adorned with a charred red, white and blue sign that proclaimed, ""United We Stand."" ""This is the beginning of our new family album,"" the 51-year-old Clements said. Perry cut short a presidential campaign trip to South Carolina to deal with the crisis. On Tuesday, he toured a blackened area near Bastrop, about 25 miles from Austin, and later deployed the state's elite search team to the area to look for more possible victims. Texas Task Force 1 is the same outfit sent to New York following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and to New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. ""Pretty powerful visuals of individuals who lost everything,"" Perry said after the tour. ""The magnitude of these losses are pretty stunning."" The governor would not say whether he would take part in Wednesday evening's Republican presidential debate in California, explaining that he was ""substantially more concerned about making sure Texans are being taken care of."""

Compounding the situation, rain and clouds hid signs of the toxic shower of debris, known as a pyroclastic flow, hurtling down the mountainside, hindering visual observation. The scalding material that poured out of Fuego, which means “Fire” in Spanish, has killed 100 people, with more than 190 missing, authorities say, as rescue work on Thursday was suspended as it was too dangerous for the workers."
Typhoon,"On Wednesday, Tropical Storm Butchoy was just a cluster of thunderstorms over that nation. FreightWaves reported on the potential for this storm to intensify, and now mainland China is bracing for impact.
The storm — known as Tropical Storm Nuri in China — will travel across the South China Sea this weekend, maintaining tropical storm status. As of 11 a.m. EDT Friday (11 p.m. Friday Hong Kong time), its sustained winds were 40 mph, with gusts of 50.
The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has issued a T1 tropical cyclone warning. This indicates that a tropical cyclone is centered within 500 miles (800 km) of Hong Kong, which may affect the city and its ports.
Winds and swells in Hong Kong are expected to gradually increase Saturday. The HKO will consider issuing the T3 strong wind warning depending on how badly conditions deteriorate. Meteorologists with the HKO are predicting gale force winds up to 54 mph for Saturday, flirting with severe tropical storm status (55 to 73 mph).
There’s a slim chance Nuri could strengthen into a typhoon — winds of at least 74 mph, like an Atlantic hurricane."

The country has seen extremely high temperatures in recent weeks. On Monday the capital, Delhi, saw its highest ever June temperature of 48C. In Rajasthan, the city of Churu recently experienced highs of 50.8C, making it the hottest place on the planet.
Further south, less than 250 miles from the country’s commercial capital, Mumbai, village after village lies deserted. Estimates suggest up to 90% of the area’s population has fled, leaving the sick and elderly to fend for themselves in the face of a water crisis that shows no sign of abating.
The village of Hatkarwadi, about 20 miles from Beed in Maharashtra state, is almost completely deserted.
Wells and handpumps have run dry in the 45C heatwave. The drought, which officials say is worse than the 1972 famine that affected 25 million people across the state, began early in December. By the end of May, Hatkarwadi had been deserted with only 10-15 families remaining out of a population of more than 2,000.
With 80% of districts in neighbouring Karnataka and 72% in Maharashtra hit by drought and crop failure, the 8 million farmers in these two states are struggling to survive. More than 6,000 tankers supply water to villages and hamlets in Maharashtra daily, as conflict brews between the two states over common water resources.
The acute water shortage has devastated villagers’ agriculture-based livelihood. Crops have withered and died, leaving livestock starving and with little to drink. Major crops, including maize, soya, cotton, sweet lime, pulses and groundnuts _ drivers of the local economy _ have suffered."

There's particular concern about the city of Guiuan, with a population of 47,000, which was the first in line when Haiyan made landfall.
The typhoon has brought down power lines and trees, and destroyed crops, buildings and houses.
Amateur video has shown flooded streets caused both by heavy rain and a storm surge that was predicted to be as high as to seven metres.
Sea travel and flights have been suspended, and schools have been closed in the central region.
Rescue agencies say they are struggling to assess the full extent of the damage as the storm continues to batter the country.
The head of the Philippines Red Cross, Gwendolyn Pang, has told Asia Pacific even those who have sought emergency shelter are still at risk.
""Even people in evacuation centres - we are not quite sure if they're safe because the wind is very strong,"" she said.
""We have seen in the previous disasters - especially typhoons - still evacuation centres are not really safe for the people.
""We're trying our best to continue to monitor the situation...but it's so huge - so big.""
Ms Pang says the wind is making any aid efforts difficult.
""The challenge now is how are we going to continue to support the people in the next few hours or days because...our the wind is very strong and our activities are very limited at the moment,"" she said."
Typhoon,"A fast-moving typhoon blew away from the Philippines on Monday after leaving at least 13 people missing, forcing thousands of villagers to flee to safety and flooding rural villages, disaster-response officials said.
The 13 people missing from Typhoon Molave included a dozen fishermen who ventured out to sea over the weekend despite a no-sail restriction due to very rough seas. There were no immediate reports of casualties.
The typhoon was blowing west toward the South China Sea with sustained winds of 125 kilometers (77 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 150 kph (93 mph). It roared overnight through island provinces south of the capital, Manila, which was lashed by strong winds but escaped major damage.
At least 25,000 villagers were displaced, with about 20,000 taking shelter in schools and government buildings that were turned into evacuation centers, the Office of Civil Defense said, but officials added that some have returned home in regions where the weather has cleared."
other,"Why the volcano erupting in the Caribbean has such a deadly reputation Since December 2020, a strange and gloopy mass of lava has been oozing from the top of La Soufrière, a volcano on the northern side of the Caribbean island of St. Vincent. This eruption posed no real threat to the 110,000 or so people living on the island, but things took a turn for the worse at the end of March, when the volcano began shaking in a way that suggested something more violent was coming. Sure enough, at 8:41 a.m. local time today, the first of several major explosions rocked the mountain, kicking off a more dangerous phase of the eruption. The situation on the island is extremely febrile: Anywhere from 20,000 to 30,000 people in the north needed evacuation, either off-island via boat, or to the island’s south via a single, jam-packed road. The process began the day before the blast and was still ongoing as the eruptions began."

earthquake,"A magnitude-6.8 offshore earthquake occurred in the South Pacific Ocean off central Chile at around 1839 Dec. 27. The epicenter was about 142 km (88 miles) northwest of Valdivia. The tremor occurred at a depth of about 10 km (6 miles), and moder-to-strong shaking was probably felt throughout central Chile. The quake likely damaged structures in nearby areas. Aftershocks are possible over the coming days.
Officials may temporarily shut down transportation infrastructure in the tremor zone to check for damage. Disruptions could occur during shutdowns. Utility outages are possible, particularly near the earthquake's epicenter. The event has not prompted any tsunami advisories."
earthquake,"Tsunami alerts were mistakenly sent to Anchorage after 7.8 earthquake off Alaska Peninsula, officials say Tuesday’s magnitude 7.8 earthquake off the Alaska Peninsula didn’t warrant the sending of tsunami alerts as far as Anchorage, the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center said Wednesday. The warnings were justified for coastal communities where they prompted evacuations for communities like Homer and Kodiak, but geologists told Alaska Public Media it was unlikely the quake could have generated a large tsunami in Anchorage, about 500 miles northeast of its epicenter. Dave Snider, the tsunami warning coordinator at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which operates the Tsunami Warning Center, said it’s unclear why AT&T customers in Anchorage - and potentially customers of other providers - received the erroneous alerts on Tuesday night. ""I'm very concerned about that, and that would go for any type of alert,"" Snider told Alaska Public Media. ""If you're getting a message that doesn't apply to you, the 'cry wolf' issue is certainly alive and present."

Typhoon,"Hong Kong may have to brace for a typhoon slamming its large container port this weekend.
A cluster of thunderstorms over the Philippines has the potential to become a typhoon during the next couple of days. This would be the second named storm of the 2020 Pacific typhoon season. The first was Typhoon Vongfong, known as Typhoon Ambo in the Philippines, which hit that island nation in May. The season runs throughout the year, but most Pacific typhoons develop from May through October.
This storm, which would be named Typhoon Nuri, will likely track over the northern Philippines on Friday, June 12, moving into southeastern China over the weekend. The projected track takes the storm close to Hong Kong on Sunday, June 14.
The potential typhoon could delay various services, from container cargo to cruises and public transportation.
Hong Kong is one of the busiest container ports in the world, according to the Hong Kong Maritime and Port Board website. It handled 18.3 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) of containers in 2019, and provided about 300 container liner services per week connecting to around 420 destinations worldwide.The Port of Hong Kong is also home to cruise liners and government fleets, and it operates ferries between Hong Kong and mainland China."

Ontake Is Still Erupting As Questions Emerge About Warnings The volcano whose eruption surprised hikers in central Japan this weekend sent a plume of ash and gas more than 1,500 feet into the air Monday as it continued to erupt, officials say. That has complicated efforts to find victims and survivors, and rescue efforts have again been halted. At least 36 people are feared dead in the eruption that hit just before noon Saturday, stranding people who had been ascending Mt. Ontake to take in views of the colorful fall foliage. They suddenly found themselves in peril, as the volcano erupted and a huge cloud of ash rolled down the mountain. More than 200 people eventually reached safety, but officials are unsure how many others might still be on the mountain. They're reportedly investigating cars that are still parked in lots near the mountain's base for clues to how many hikers remain stranded on its heights."
wildfires,"Authorities in Alaska are reporting an unusually high number of wildfires burning simultaneously across the tundra and forests of the state, and an exceptionally large number of homes and buildings have been damaged or threatened by the flames so far this year.Wildfires are a common occurrence in Alaska, but this year’s fires started earlier than normal and have escalated quickly. A light winter snowpack and little rain in the spring left dry ground particularly vulnerable to fires that break out when lightning strikes, said Tim Mowry, a public information officer with the Alaska Division of Forestry.
The total area affected by the fires—roughly 624,000 acres—is not exceptional, but it is spread out over a larger number of separate fires burning in different areas, Mowry said.
The state has seen 562 fires so far this year, and the bulk of those started recently and at around the same time."
Typhoon,"Hurricane season may kick off early, with the potential for the year's first named storm to form off the coast of Florida and the Bahamas.
Tropical (or, potentially, Subtropical) Storm Arthur, as it will be called if conditions develop into a named storm system - has a 70 per cent chance of forming over the next five days, according to the US National Hurricane Center.
In order for a tropical storm to become a hurricane, it has to establish a warm core, which then must intensify into hurricane-force winds.
Hurricane season usually begins on 1 June, but the storm season is starting early this year due in part to the above-average temperatures across the Atlantic ocean. In addition to its early start, meteorologists are predicting this year will have an especially active hurricane season, with most expecting more than six named hurricanes, and some meteorologists predicting more than nine.
The Orlando Sentinel reported that Floridians aren't likely to be overly affected by the storm. Speaking to Jayme King, a meteorologist for local news station Fox 35, the paper reported that Floridians can expect a 40 to 50 per cent chance of rain on Friday near Orlando, with heavier rainfall in the south of the state.
In addition to heavy rain, dangerous surf and tropical-storm force winds - 39-73mph (34 to 63 knots) - are expected."
drought,"Alaska’s wettest region is experiencing an extreme drought for the first time in recorded history, climate scientists say.
The southernmost portion of Southeast Alaska, including Ketchikan, Prince of Wales Island, Wrangell and Metlakatla, has been in a drought for the last two years, said Rick Thoman, a climatologist at the Fairbanks-based Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy.
Last week, though, the drought was updated to a D3, or “extreme” drought, the second-highest category the U.S. Drought Monitor measures. It’s the first time those conditions have ever been recorded in Alaska, according to the Drought Monitor.
Meanwhile, areas experiencing lesser “severe” and “moderate” droughts on the Panhandle have expanded, the Drought Monitor said.
Droughts look different in the rainforest climate of Southeast Alaska than elsewhere in the world, though, with the key difference being that the region is still getting quite a lot of precipitation by most standards, Thoman said.
Ketchikan has averaged about 100 inches annually since 2017, and Metlakatla has seen between 80 and 90, climatologists say.
“In the mass amount of the world that would be an immense amount of rain,” Thoman said.
However, that’s still drastically less than what’s normal for the region. Ketchikan normally averages 150 inches of precipitation a year, and Metlakatla 118. This year, Ketchikan has seen about 5 inches less precipitation than it normally does by this time of year, according to data from the National Weather Service."
Typhoon,"An approaching powerful typhoon has left at least one person dead, another missing and prompted the evacuation of more than 100,000 people as a precaution in the eastern and central Philippines, although the unusual summer storm is not expected to blow into land, officials said Monday.
Typhoon Surigae was about 500 kilometers (310 miles) east of Infanta town in Quezon province on Monday afternoon with sustained winds of 195 kilometers (121 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 240 kph (149 mph). It is forecast to slowly move northwestward and then veer eastward away from the northern Philippines around Thursday.
Vicente Malano, administrator of the government weather agency, said a high pressure area extending from China to Japan was blocking the typhoon from blowing inland.
“We’re lucky it’s not going to make landfall because if it hits land, it’s really going to be super devastating,” said Ariel Rojas from the weather agency.
The typhoon’s 900-kilometer (560-mile) band of rainclouds and strong winds nevertheless flooded at least 22 villages and caused power outages in four provinces. More than 3,200 people and 43 ferries and cargo ships were stranded in seaports after the coast guard suspended sea travel as the typhoon blew nearer, the government disaster-response agency and the coast guard said.
A 79-year-old man died in St. Bernard town in Southern Leyte province after being hit by a falling coconut tree, the Office of Civil Defense said. Another villager in San Jose town in Northern Samar province was missing after he went to a nearby island in a motorboat to secure his farm animals, it said.
More than 29,300 families or 109,000 people were evacuated to emergency shelters as a precaution in five eastern provinces in the Bicol region, it said. Mayors said they have to open more evacuation centers to ensure social distancing during the pandemic.
“It’s really tough, it’s toxic, but we have no choice,” Mayor Ann Gemma Ongjoco of Guinobatan town in Albay province said by telephone. She said even churches were being used to shelter more than 6,100 villagers in her town, including many from communities threatened by mudflows from Mayon, one of the most active volcanoes in the archipelago.
The Philippines is a coronavirus hotspot in Southeast Asia, with health officials reporting 945,745 infections and 16,048 deaths.

earthquake,"A 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck Saturday off the coast of Antarctica, with authorities issuing a tsunami warning for Chile's Eduardo Frei base on the frigid continent, emergency officials said.
The quake struck at 8:36 pm (2336 GMT) about 210 kilometers (130 miles) east of the base at a depth of 10 kilometers (6 miles), Chile's National Emergency Office (Onemi) said, urging evacuation from ""the beach area of the Antarctic"" ahead of a possible tsunami.
The Chilean Air Force's base is the country's largest in Antarctica, and includes a village, hospital, school, bank, post office and chapel.
The maximum population in summer is 150 people, and the average population in winter is 80.
An unrelated 5.9-magnitude earthquake struck near Santiago on Saturday night, but Onemi said no significant damage or impact was reported.
Chile is one of the most seismically active countries in the world. A 8.8-magniture temblor in the city of Concepcion on February 27, 2010 left more than 500 dead.
The country suffered the most powerful earthquake ever recorded 60 years ago -- measuring 9.6 magnitude -- in the city of Valdivia."
earthquake,"No tsunami was generated from a small earthquake off the southern coast of Hawaii Island Wednesday evening.
Officials said the quake happened at 6:45 p.m. at the Loihi Seamount, which is in the waters south of the island.

The quake was also too far offshore to cause any damage to buildings on land.
Scientists have been monitoring increased seismic activity around Hawaii Island, but say there is no threat of an immediate volcanic eruption. However, that isn’t stopping them from urging everyone to be prepared in the event of an emergency in the distant future."
earthquake,"7.0-magnitude quake strikes off southern Philippines: USGS A 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck off the southern Philippines Thursday, the US Geological Survey said, but there were no immediate reports of damage and a tsunami warning was not issued. The quake hit about 310 kilometres (193 miles) southeast of Davao city on the main southern island of Mindanao at a depth of 95 kilometres at 8:23 pm local time (1223 GMT), according to USGS. Residents in Jose Abad Santos town near the southern tip of the island lost electricity for about 15 minutes after the quake shook the region but there was no damage, police chief Captain Glabynarry Murillo told AFP. ""From our vantage point at the police station we saw many residents rushing outside,"" said Murillo. ""We also rushed outside because the police station is a three-storey building."""
earthquake,"7.5 magnitude earthquake near Alaska triggers tsunami warning A tsunami warning was issued for southern Alaska on Monday after a major earthquake and large aftershock hit near the Alaskan Peninsula. The warning was later downgraded to an advisory by the National Weather Service. An initial earthquake with a 7.5 magnitude occurred around Sand Point, Alaska, a city on one of the Shumagin Islands, just before 1 p.m. local time (5 p.m. E.T.), according to the Official U.S. Geological Survey. An aftershock hit the area about 20 minutes later at a magnitude of 5.8, the USGS said. The National Weather Service issued a tsunami warning for the Pacific coasts from Kennedy Entrance, Alaska to Unimak Pass, Alaska. Police in Homer, Alaska, asked anyone in the potential flooding zone to move to higher ground immediately in fear of a potential tsunami. Sand Point, where the earthquake appears to have originated, is about 575 nautical miles southwest of Anchorage. The city is on Popof Island, one of 20 islands in the Aleutians East Borough south of the mainland. USGS data showed at least eight aftershocks in the hour after the first quake, including five that measured between 5.2 and 5.9 in magnitude. A powerful 7.8-magnitude earthquake hit Alaska in July, also triggering fears of a possible tsunami wave. That quake happened at 10:13 p.m., roughly 75 miles south of the community of Chignik."
drought,"California is officially free of drought after more than seven years, drought monitors said Thursday.
The Golden State has experienced some form of drought for 376 consecutive weeks, the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska, tweeted. It’s the first time the state has been free of drought since Dec. 20, 2011.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration tweeted that weather in 2017 helped matters, but moderate drought persisted. Rainfall this winter further alleviated the drought, although 7 percent of the state remains ""abnormally dry.""
""The storms this year have really helped snowpacks, the reservoirs,"" said Jessica Blunden, a climatologist with NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information. Colder temperatures also helped prevent snow from melting off, she said.
This winter — the meteorological winter starts on Dec. 1 and ends at the end of February — has been the wettest in the United States as a whole since records started being kept in 1895, with an average across the nation of 9.01 inches, which is 2.22 inches above the nationwide average, Blunden said.
That precipitation has not just benefited California. ""It’s been a great winter for the West,"" she said.
The U.S. Drought Monitor website, which is an effort by several agencies including NOAA and the national drought mitigation center, says that well-above precipitation in the West helped build snow pack and fill reservoirs, and that normal conditions have returned to the Salton Sea in the southeastern part of the state.
The Los Angeles area experienced cool winter temperatures that brought the fifth-longest streak of 41 consecutive days with a high temperature below 70 degrees since records began in 1877. Rare snowfall was reported in parts of the Los Angeles area in February."

Initial reports said eight villages in the Biddu district of Ethiopia, close to the border, were covered by volcanic dust. Villagers have been left without food and traditional springs and streams have been polluted. The Afar regional government says the numbers affected could rise sharply. Save the Children told the BBC the authorities had sent a team to conduct a detailed assessment of the situation. An initial report by the regional government says the situation in border villages is a serious concern. ""Many community members and especially children are reported sick and in desperate need of medical attention,"" said Teshome Assefa, of Save the Children. ""Vomiting and retching are common."" The whereabouts of one community living close to the eruption is unknown. The Nabro volcano has sent the plumes of ash 13km (eight miles) into the air."
drought,"Drought has spread in England, with parts of East and South Yorkshire now officially affected.
The Environment Agency said public water supplies should not be affected, but lower river and groundwater levels meant businesses and farmers taking water from rivers should use it wisely.
The agency has already declared drought in areas of the South East and East Anglia.
Seven water companies in those areas are to impose hosepipe bans on 5 April.
Yorkshire Water said it did not anticipate any restrictions such as hosepipe bans for the time being.
In a statement, the company said it would constantly review the situation ""as the dry weather continues"".
""Our regional water supply system gives us flexibility, what it doesn't give us is an unlimited supply of water, so we would always encourage our customers to only use what they need, when they need it.""
As the warm spell across the UK continued on Tuesday, firefighters were involved in tackling blazes in North Yorkshire, south Wales, Dumfries and Galloway and the Borders.
The grassland fires in Scotland, which had broken out on Monday afternoon, took until Tuesday evening to extinguish.
Owing to clear conditions and its elevated position across a front of 1km-2km, the Dumfries blaze was visible as far away as Workington in Cumbria.
A Royal Navy helicopter from HMS Gannet at Prestwick was used to move firefighters and equipment across the remote hillside.
On Hanging Moor, in Thruscross, it took more than 35 firefighters almost 12 hours to bring a blaze under control, after being called to the scene early on Tuesday afternoon.
In south Wales on Tuesday, a grass fire spread to a house, garage and electricity poles near Pontardawe in the Swansea Valley, while forestry in the Rhondda Fach was also hit by a spreading grass fire.
The Environment Agency has warned that above-average rainfall could be required in coming weeks if drought is not to spread more widely.

The Rocky Fire is the biggest, covering 54,000 acres, an area larger than San Francisco. It has already destroyed two-dozen homes, and upwards of 6,000 more are in danger.
It is just five percent contained and continues to grow. Erratic winds, on top of temperatures in the triple digits, have made a bad situation much worse.
The fire started five days ago, scorching nearly 85 square miles of land northwest of Sacramento, forcing thousands of people from their homes. It doubled in size over the weekend.
""I couldn't get back if I wanted to, and with the fire danger, I'm not sure I want to,"" one evacuated resident said.

Typhoon,"A powerful typhoon pounded South Korea with strong winds and heavy rain Tuesday, killing nine and churning up rough seas that smashed two Chinese fishing ships into rocks and forced the coast guard to perform a daring rescue of survivors.
Rescuers saved 12 fishermen and searched for 10 still missing from the ships that hit rocks off South Korea's southern Jeju island. Five fishermen were killed, officials said.
Separately, at least four other people died as Typhoon Bolaven knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of South Koreans, cancelled flights and temporarily halted joint war games by U.S. and South Korean military forces.
North Korea, which is still struggling to rebuild from massive floods and a devastating drought before that, was next in the typhoon's path. Heavy rain and strong winds hit many parts of the country Tuesday, a day that was supposed to be a North Korean celebration of its young people.
The typhoon knocked down hundreds of trees, destroyed power cables and caused blackouts in the western cities of Kaesong and Haeju, the North's official Korean Central News Agency said. It said damage was expected to grow as the typhoon moves across the country.
Off South Korea's Jeju island, dangerous waves kept rescue vessels from approaching the wrecked fishing ships. The coast guard used a special gun to shoot rope to one ship so officers could pull themselves over and bring the fishermen back to shore, coast guard spokesman Ko Chang-keon said.
Eighteen fishermen survived. The coast guard rescued 12, and the others swam or were washed ashore."
Typhoon,"Delta has been downgraded from a once powerful hurricane to a tropical storm as it moves inland across the U.S. South.
The National Hurricane Center in Miami said Delta came ashore Friday evening in southwest Louisiana as a Category 2 hurricane but quickly weakened and has become a tropical storm as it moves inland. By Saturday morning, it had maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 kph).
Forecasters say the storm is moving to the north-northeast on a track across central and north Louisiana that is expected to continue through Saturday morning.

Typhoon,"The Atlantic hurricane season is off to a record fast start and is likely to get worse The 2020 Atlantic hurricane season is already making history, just over a month after it officially began. When Tropical Storm Edouard formed Sunday night over the open waters of the northwest Atlantic, it became the earliest fifth named storm on record. Edouard has since morphed into a nontropical storm, but it signals the possibility of a long and punishing hurricane season, which has already set records linked to abnormally warm ocean waters. Tropical storms and hurricanes require sea surface temperatures of at least 79 degrees to form and sustain themselves, and have expanded farther north than usual this summer. Edouard, for example, formed amid sea surface temperatures near 80 degrees, about four to five degrees above average."
Typhoon,"Strong hurricanes could hit Asia and the U.S. East Coast more often this century, a new study finds.
The research adds to a growing body of evidence that hurricanes are becoming more intense as global warming heats the oceans. This means Category 1, 2 and 3 storms will have fiercer winds, bumping them up to Category 3, 4 and higher. Overall, the study's modeling approach predicts a 40 percent global increase in tropical cyclones of Category 3 and higher during the 21st century.
The findings were published in Monday's issue of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
The new study also projects that these strong storms will become more frequent in the North Pacific, the North Atlantic and the South Indian Oceans.
""We see an increase, in particular, toward the middle of the century,"" said Kerry Emanuel, study author and an MIT climatologist. ""The results surprised us, but we haven't gotten so far as to understand why this is happening.""
Scientists actively debate whether tropical cyclones (the broad name for hurricanes, typhoons and tropical storms) will become more frequent, more intense or both as a result of climate change. Global warming has heated the oceans along with the atmosphere, and sea-surface temperature is one of the most important influences on hurricane strength. But other factors — such as climate cycles, like the El Ni_o Southern Oscillation, and interactions with other storms, which can weaken or strengthen storms — also alter tropical storm strength. Hurricanes are also marvelous heat transporters, affecting climate by moving energy around the planet. [Hurricanes from Above: See Nature's Biggest Storms]
""For scientists, this is far from a solved problem,"" said Emanuel, who has been a main participant in the debates on the future of hurricanes. ""The main message is, we have to continue to regard there being a not-trivial risk of increasing problems from tropical cyclones because of climate change.""
How global warming fuels hurricanes
Hurricanes feed off warm ocean water. In the ocean's hurricane nurseries, heat rising from the ocean turns into water vapor. As the vapor rises and cools, it condenses into rain. This releases heat, which helps strengthen circulating tropical cyclones. Warmer oceans mean more water vapor, and more intense storms.
Emanuel relies on a technique called downscaling to estimate how future climate change will shift hurricane strength and frequency. In the new study, he used the latest global climate models, called CMIP5, which project future climate change but are too coarse to resolve ""small"" features, such as hurricanes. Emanuel ran the models at higher-resolution and randomly generated disturbances similar to tropical cyclones, and then used a theoretical model to predict how strong the storms would become. Emanuel first presented this approach, with an earlier version of the CMIP models (CMIP3), in a 2008 paper in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.
One limitation of relying on global climate models to predict future hurricanes is that these models do not capture the past decade's climate variability, such as relatively stable temperatures between 1998 and 2008, said Peter Webster, a climatologist at Georgia Tech who was not involved in the study. (The hiatus is attributed to natural variability in Earth's climate system, superimposed on the longer-term warming trend.)"

An Alert Level 4 means that a hazardous explosive eruption is possible within hours to days; and warrants a “Danger Zone” of up to 14 kilometres from the main crater. Approximately 459,300 people are living within the 14 kilometres Danger Zone (OCHA). Taal Volcano is among the most active volcanoes in the Philippines, with more than 30 reported eruptions. According to DOST- PHIVOLCS, eruptive activity at Taal Volcano main crater has intensified, with continuous eruptions generating a 15 kilometre of steam laden cloud of super-heated ash, with frequent volcanic lightning that has rained wet ashfall as far as Quezon City, some 100 kilometres away. This has subsequently progressed to a magmatic eruption accompanied by thunder and more lightning early Monday morning."

Devastating destruction
Alberta cabinet minister Thomas Lukaszuk said it was the largest single-day displacement of people in the province's history.
Ms Pillay-Kinnee, who toured Slave Lake on Monday afternoon, called the destruction in the town ""truly devastating"", adding that it would ""take a while to rebuild"".
""It's heart-wrenching as people lose their homes, their livelihood. For myself, I'm just trying to remain focused on the task at hand,"" Ms Pillay-Kinnee told the Calgary Herald newspaper.
Wildfires breached the town late on Sunday, reducing many homes and businesses to collapsed timber.
The government centre and library were destroyed by the blazes, while the police station and hospital remained unaffected.
By Monday evening, a blaze east of Slave Lake had consumed about 20 sq km (7.7 sq miles), and a fire south of the town had burned 150 sq km (57.9 sq miles).
More than 100 wildfires were burning in Alberta as of Monday, and roughly 40 of those fires were considered out of control, local media reported.
Fires forced oil companies in Alberta, the country's largest energy producing province, to shut off thousands of barrels of output.
The Canadian government has deployed 1,000 firefighters, 100 helicopters and 20 water bombers to battle wildfires throughout the entire province."
earthquake,"A powerful earthquake struck off the coast of northeastern Japan at 05:46:23 UTC (14:46:23 local time) on March 11, causing severe shaking near the epicenter region and triggering a massive tsunami that devastated coastal communities. Estimates issued by AIR Worldwide, EQECAT and Risk Management Solutions (RMS) suggest insured losses could be between USD12 billion and USD34 billion. There are fears the death toll could now exceed 27,000 people and powerful aftershocks continue to shake the region. Tens of thousands of buildings were destroyed or damaged across northern Japan despite the country boasting the strictest building standards in the world. Officials say the situation at the quake-damaged nuclear facility in Fukushima has improved over the last couple of weeks, but remains serious. According to both the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA), the earthquake’s magnitude was measured at 9.0, making it the fourth most powerful earthquake in the world since 1900 and the largest in Japan since modern instrumental recordings began 130 years ago. The USGS added that the earthquake was located 130 kilometers (80 miles) east of Sendai and 373 kilometers (230 miles) northeast of Tokyo, at a depth of 32 kilometers (19.9 miles).
More than 1,000 aftershocks have hit the region since the main earthquake, the most powerful at 7.9Mw. Two powerful aftershocks have hit the region recently. A 7.1Mw earthquake killed at least three people and caused blackouts in many areas when it struck around 65 kilometers (40 miles) east of Sendai on April 7. Several buildings were reportedly destroyed and power was cut to around 3.6 million households. The second big aftershock occurred this morning (April 11). The epicenter of this 6.6Mw earthquake occurred inland, around 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of Tokyo. Authorities issued a tsunami alert immediately after the earthquake, but it was subsequently cancelled. Officials said several landslides and power outages occurred, but there have been no immediate reports of major damage."
other,"Volcanic eruption in Caribbean prompts Baptist church meals, relief agency supplies A local pastor and international relief agencies plan to assist St. Vincent residents with physical and spiritual needs during what is expected to be a long recovery. (RNS) — The Rev. Cecil Richards is working with members of his Kingstown Baptist Church to help feed people in St. Vincent who have been evacuated due to the volcanic eruption on the island nation. Soon after the initial eruption on Friday (April 9), volunteers prepared 170 meals from their church kitchen to distribute to evacuees at shelters in the southern part of the main island. The total meals increased to 250 by Monday and, he hopes, 300 soon. “That is only our immediate response,” he said of his church that is usually attended by 250 to 300 people in nonpandemic times. “That can’t be it.”"
wildfires,"A fast-moving wildfire burning Monday along the Royal Gorge and U.S. 50 west of Ca?on City forced the evacuation of homes, businesses, campgrounds and parks, including Royal Gorge and Buckskin Joe, and destroyed several structures.
“Anybody, whether they’re businesses, whether they’re residences, camping or anything else, everybody has been evacuated from the area,” said Bureau of Land Management spokeswoman Cass Cairns.
By Monday evening, winds with gusts of 20 mph to 30 mph had pushed the fire northeast from the intersection of U.S. 50 and Colorado 9 over 700 acres. Smoke and poor visibility closed U.S. 50 6 miles west of Ca?on City.
The Fremont County Sheriff’s Office called 177 businesses and residents asking them to evacuate. Cairns said it was unclear how many structures had burned or whether any were homes.
Smoke from the fire burning in an area known as Parkdale could be seen and smelled in Colorado Springs on Monday night.
The National Weather Service issued a red flag warning for the region, advising that strong winds and relatively low humidity might cause the fire to spread.
About 50 firefighters were battling the fire on the ground, supported by a fleet of aircraft dropping flame retardant, Cairns said. These included one large air tanker, a single-engine plane, a large helicopter and a smaller helicopter.
Mike Bandera, general manager of the Royal Gorge Bridge, said the historic bridge was not threatened but that homes along Fremont County Road 61 were evacuated.
Bandera said he first saw the flames about 1:30 p.m. Monday, jumping as high as 20 feet into the air.
Overnight, firefighters will continue to monitor the blaze and create fire breaks to minimize the spread. They will fight the fire depending on the direction it is headed, how active it is and on firefighter safety, Cairns said.
Meanwhile, the fire sparked by lightning in the Great Sand Dunes National Park a few weeks ago has engulfed 4,700 acres. Strong winds stoked the blaze.
On the Western Slope, a 170-acre blaze was burning on the Roan Plateau, 10 miles northwest of Rifle.
“It’s a fairly remote, rugged area and not threatening any structures,” said Dave Boyd, spokesman for the Upper Colorado River Interagency Fire Management Unit.
Colorado has about 300 wildfires a year, Boyd said, most of which stay small. A normal fire season is predicted for Colorado this year, Boyd said."
wildfires,"Emergency crews continued to battle a fast-moving wildfire in Alaska on Monday, as flames swept across 6,500 acres early in the morning.
Additional firefighters from the Lower 48 states were called in to assist local crews in battling the Sockeye Fire, which is burning along the Parks Highway in the town of Willow, about 81 miles north of Anchorage. Ongoing hot, dry weather and a lack of rain and moisture in the area are exacerbating the conditions, fire officials said.
Crews are focused on evacuating residents and saving homes, while planes are flying overhead to drop water onto the blaze.
Authorities have not yet estimated the number of damaged structures."
earthquake,"A powerful 8.9-magnitude earthquake hit Japan on Friday (March 11) at 1446 local time (0546 GMT), unleashing massive tsunami waves that crashed into Japan's eastern coast of Honshu, the largest and main island of Japan, resulting in widespread damage and destruction. According to the Government of Japan (GoJ) as of Saturday (March 12), at least 464 people have been reported dead and some 725 people are reported to be missing, the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported. The GoJ's chief spokesperson said the death toll could exceed 1,000. Local media put the death toll closer to 1,300 people. As initial assessments come in it is expected that the death toll will rise due to the extensive devastation along the coastline and majority of the casualties are likely to be the result of the tsunami. The earthquake sparked widespread tsunami warnings across the Pacific that stretched from Japan to North and South America. According to the US Geological Survey (USGS), the shallow quake struck at a depth of six miles (10 km) (20 km deep according to Japan's Meteorological Agency), around 80 miles (125 km) off the eastern coast of Japan, and 240 miles (380 km) northeast of Tokyo. It was reportedly the largest recorded quake in Japan's history and the fifth largest in the world since 1900. The quake was also felt in Japan's capital city, Tokyo, located hundreds of miles from the epicenter and was also felt as far away as the Chinese capital Beijing, some 1,500 miles away. There have been at least 79 aftershocks recorded and 16 of them have been greater than 6.0 magnitude, including one recorded at 7.1 magnitude. According to the UN, the continuing aftershocks and tsunami are hampering rescue efforts. Up to 3 meter high waves reportedly continue to hit the coast. GoJ officials also ordered new evacuations in several coastal areas, sending residents to higher ground.
Earthquakes had affected the region recently, including a 7.3-magnitude quake Wednesday (March 9) that did not cause any damage. Japan's worst previous quake was an 8.3 magnitude quake in 1923 that left some 143,000 dead. More recently, the 7.2-magnitude earthquake in Kobe in 1995 left some 6,400 dead."
drought,"As Texas continues to bake in record heat, the drought news for the state continues to be bleak _ Texas is now in the midst of its most severe one-year drought on record, according to John Nielsen-Gammon, the Texas State Climatologist and professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University.
Preliminary reports from the National Climatic Data Center indicate that July 2011 was the warmest month ever recorded statewide for Texas, with data going back to 1895, Nielsen-Gammon reports. The average temperature of 87.2 degrees broke the previous record of 86.5 degrees set in 1998. The June average temperature of 85.2 was a record for that month and now ranks fifth warmest overall.
Rainfall totals were also unusually light across the state. The July monthly total of 0.72 inches ranks third driest, surpassed by the 0.69 inches recorded in both 1980 and 2000. This is the fifth consecutive month in which precipitation totals were among the 10 driest for that month, says the Texas A&M professor.
Among the other rainfall records set this month: least year-to-date precipitation (6.53 inches; historical average 16.03 inches; previous record 9.36 inches in 1917); driest consecutive 8, 9 and 10 months on record (7.25 inches 8.35 inches, and 9.17 inches respectively); and driest 12 months ending in July (15.16 inches, previous record 16.46 inches in 1925)."

Typhoon,"Tropical Storm Fay makes landfall in New Jersey (CNN)Tropical Storm Fay made landfall Friday in New Jersey, about 10 miles north-northeast of Atlantic City, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm contains maximum sustained winds of about 45 mph, with higher gusts, but was weakening. It was moving north at 14 mph and should pick up speed through the evening and overnight as it moves through southeastern New York and western New England. Minor flooding was reported and there were no immediate reports of significant impact. As the system moves north over the next 24 hours, it will continue to bring a threat of flooding from New Jersey and Pennsylvania to New York and southern New England. Fay is expected to weaken to a tropical depression by Saturday morning, the NHC said."
Typhoon,"Six tourists, including two young children, have been killed in a freak storm in Greece.
Trees and pylons were ripped up, vehicles overturned and a sea of debris strewn everywhere as the storm tore through the northern Halkidiki peninsula on Wednesday night.
A total of seven people were killed and about 140 more were injured, although most of them not seriously, police said.
Two elderly Czech tourists died after high winds overturned their vehicle, while an eight-year-old boy and his mother from Romania were killed when an outdoor restaurant’s lean-to roof collapsed.
A man and a young boy, both Russians, also died when a tree fell near their hotel.

Smoke from a grassland fire in south central South Dakota shut down a 15-mile stretch of Interstate 90 Wednesday night. Several other fires burned across the state Thursday, including one near Wessington in the east that scorched about 320 acres and prompted the evacuation of one home. In the west, fire crews did mop-up work on a blaze that threatened several homes west of Rapid City earlier in the week.
In western North Dakota, the Killdeer Fire Department lost a pumper truck when its engine failed while crews were fighting a blaze that prompted the evacuation of one home. A fire on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation burned more than 1,000 acres, or about 1  square miles."
Typhoon,"Typhoon Talas dumped record amounts of rain Sunday in western and central Japan, killing at least 20 people and stranding thousands more as it turned towns into lakes, washed away cars and triggered mudslides that obliterated houses. At least 50 people were missing, local media reported.
Evacuation orders and advisories were issued to 460,000 people in the region, which is hundreds of kilometres from the country's tsunami-ravaged northeastern coast.
At least 3,600 people were stranded by flooded rivers, landslides and collapsed bridges that were hampering rescue efforts, Kyodo News agency reported.
Public broadcaster NHK showed a bridge swept away after intense rain caused a river to swell with brown torrents. People holding umbrellas waded through knee-deep water in city streets and residential areas.
The typhoon dumped record amounts of rain in some areas, and more was expected. It was the country's worst storm since one in 2004 that left 98 people either dead or missing, the Yomiuri newspaper said. By Sunday, Talas had been downgraded to a tropical storm."

The_ropical cyclone_roduced high_inds, coastal storm surges, heavy rains, and_looding_n the land areas over which it passed. By far the worst-hit region was the central Philippines, where the storm produced widespread devastation and killed thousands of people. Many considered it to be the country’s worst natural disaster. With maximum sustained winds at landfall there that measured 195 miles (314 km) per hour, Haiyan was among the most powerful tropical cyclones ever recorded, if not the most powerful, to strike land.
The typhoon began as an area of_onvection_ocated in the equatorial Pacific Ocean some 230 nautical miles (425 km) east-southeast of_ohnpei_n November 2. Later that day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) at_earl Harbor,_awaii, reclassified the disturbance as a tropical depression, naming the storm Tropical Depression 31W. The system traveled westward across the tropical Pacific Ocean over the next few days, growing in size and strength. The Japan Meteorological Agency reclassified the phenomenon as a_ropical storm_t midnight_reenwich Mean Time(GMT) on November 4 and assigned the name Haiyan, after its winds had reached a measured speed of 40 miles (64 km) per hour. With winds increasing to 75 miles (120 km) per hour sometime during the early afternoon on November 5, Haiyan had become a typhoon.
The storm continued to increase in intensity, and the JTWC upgraded Haiyan to a super typhoon (equivalent to a strong category 4 or category 5 hurricane, with maximum sustained one-minute surface winds of at least 150 miles [241 km] per hour) at 2:45_M_MT (10:45_M_ocal time) on November 6. At that moment Haiyan was located some 113 nautical miles (209 km) east-northeast of Palau and was moving westward at about 21 miles (about 34 km) per hour. Later in the day, the storm swelled to more than 500 miles (about 800 km) in diameter with a 9-mile- (14.5-km-) wide eye. Early in the morning of November 7, the storm’s eye wall passed over Palau’s Kayangel Islands with winds that, according to some reports, approached 155 miles (250 km) per hour. Haiyan’s winds continued to increase through the day, rising to 195 miles (314 km) per hour with gusts measured at 235 miles (378 km) per hour.
Haiyan made landfall in the Philippines at the city of Guiuan on the island of_amar_t 4:40_M_ocal time on November 8. The storm’s_tmospheric pressure_t that point was measured at 895 millibars (its lowest reading), and Haiyan had maximum sustained winds of 195 miles (314 km) per hour, the highest wind speed ever recorded at landfall. By 8:00_M_ocal time, Haiyan had reached the city of_acloban_n the island of_eyte, with winds in excess of 185 miles (298 km) per hour."
earthquake,"At least 65 people have died and more than 100 are missing after a powerful earthquake struck the southern New Zealand city of Christchurch, collapsing buildings, burying vehicles under debris and sending rescuers scrambling to help people trapped under rubble.
The 6.3-magnitude quake struck the country's second largest city on a busy weekday afternoon.
The mayor of Christchurch, Bob Parker, has declared a state of emergency and ordered people to evacuate the city centre. ""Make no mistake this is going to be a very black day for this shaken city,"" he said.
Power and water was cut and hundreds of dazed, screaming and crying residents wandered through the streets as sirens blared throughout Christchurch in the aftermath of the quake, which was centred three miles from the city. The US Geological Survey said the tremor occurred at a depth of 2.5 miles."
Typhoon,"Typhoon Utor powered ashore on the northern Philippine Island of Luzon on Monday near 3 am local time (3 pm EDT Sunday) as a Category 4 storm with 140 mph winds. Damage was heavy in Casiguran (population 24,000) near where the typhoon made landfall, with 80% of the infrastructure of the town reportedly destroyed, and all roads into the city blocked. Utor is being blamed for two deaths so far, and 44 fishermen are reported as missing.
Passage over Luzon disrupted the inner core of Utor, reducing the storm to Category 2 strength with winds of 100 mph. Satellite imagery shows that the typhoon is re-organizing, and a new eyewall is forming. Ocean temperatures are very warm, about 30°C (86°F), which is approximately 0.5 - 1.0°C above average. These warm waters extend to tremendous depth, giving Utor a huge source of energy to tap into. Wind shear is low, 5 - 10 knots. These favorable conditions for intensification will last until the typhoon gets midway between the Philippines and China, where wind shear will rise to the moderate range and ocean waters will cool to 29°C with a much lower heat content. I expect Utor will intensify into a Category 3 storm today, and make landfall in China as a Category 2 or 3 storm about 200 hundred miles southwest of Hong Kong about 06 UTC on Wednesday. Utor is a very wet storm, and will likely bring a large swath of 8+ inches of rain across Southeast China on Wednesday. These rains will cause dangerous flash flooding and mudslides.
Utor is a Marshallese word for squall line, and has been used for three tropical cyclones in the Western Pacific--in 2001, 2006, and 2013. Utor reached super typhoon status with 150 mph winds on Sunday, making it the strongest tropical cyclone globally so far in 2013. Earth's previous most powerful tropical cyclone of 2013 was Typhoon Soulik, which reached Category 4 strength with 145 mph winds on July 10. Soulik weakened to a Category 2 storm before hitting Taiwan on July 12."
Typhoon,"The turbulent Atlantic hurricane season passed a grim new milestone as Subtropical Storm Theta formed on Monday night.
The arrival of Theta means that 2020 has now broken the record for the number of storms strong enough to be given names in a single season.
Theta is the 29th named storm of the hurricane season, and meteorologists say another could strike the Caribbean in the coming days.
So far, a dozen storms have made landfall in the US this year. Storms have also caused severe damage across Central American and Caribbean countries including Belize, Bermuda, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua and Panama."

Could it see a similar fate anytime soon? Spoiler: Nope. Not for a very, very, very long time. However, it is still considered an active volcano. Colorado's Dotsero volcano is a sprawling indentation in the mountains just northeast of the unincorporated community of Dotsero in Eagle County off Interstate 70. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) rates the threat of Dotsero erupting as ""moderate,"" meaning it requires ""basic real-time monitoring coverage,"" according to its website, and could impact air travel if it erupted."
drought,"Almost half of India _ an area home to more than 500 million people _ is facing drought-like conditions while a blistering heatwave has killed dozens of people in the impoverished eastern state of Bihar.
As the country suffers its lowest rainfall ahead of a monsoon season in more than six decades, the western state of Maharashtra witnesses its worst drought in 47 years, forcing many to leave their lands and take shelter in relief camps, as they wait for monsoon rains.
Reporting from Beed in Maharashtra, Al Jazeera’s Elizabeth Puranam said people walk in intense heat, sometimes for kilometres, only to find a small amount of muddy water at the bottom of a well.
Asha Pawar said she collects about five pots _ or 100 litres _ of water a day for herself and her four children. The state government provides water tankers, but Pawar said they only come every four or five days.
“We have no arrangements for water. We keep getting it from whatever source is available. If nothing is available, we climb down the well for drinking water,” Pawar told Al Jazeera.
“My daughter fell in the well when she went to fetch water. A passer-by rescued her when he heard her scream.”
Elsewhere in Beed, farmers have left their land and moved to nearby relief camps, where the government provides fodder and water to keep their cattle alive.
“There is no water left in the Beed area. It used to rain by June 7, but there are still no signs of rains. Last year, we had a drought situation. This year is worse. If it doesn’t rain again this year, we have to leave our village,” said farmer Navnath Kadam, who has already spent four months at a relief camp."

Typhoon,"At least 20 people were killed as Typhoon Goni lashed the Philippines over the weekend, and about 13,000 shanties and houses were damaged or swept away in the eastern island province that was first hit by the ferocious storm, officials said Monday.
Goni blasted into Catanduanes province at dawn Sunday as a super typhoon with sustained winds of 225 kilometers (140 miles) per hour and gusts of 280 kph (174 mph). But it weakened considerably after making landfall and shifted direction to spare the capital, Manila, before blowing out into the South China Sea.
The Office of Civil Defense said at least 20 people were killed in Catanduanes and nearby Albay province.
Catanduanes, an island province of more than 260,000 people that is often lashed by Pacific storms, was isolated after losing power and communications due to Goni and another typhoon that had hit a week earlier. But officials there managed to connect to the outside world on Monday after disaster-response authorities flew to the devastated island with satellite phones.
Catanduanes Gov. Joseph Cua and other officials said the typhoon whipped up 5-meter (16-foot) storm surges and damaged or swept away about 13,000 houses. Many residents fled to safety from their homes as the typhoon approached.
More than 66,000 other houses and huts were damaged elsewhere in the region, officials said.
Cua described the onslaught as “severe” and reported that some coastal areas were swamped by frightening storm surges.
About 80% of the electricity posts on the island were toppled and roads linking the province’s 11 towns remained impassable, Cua said.
An army general on the island appealed for more troops to help distribute food packs and water to residents. He added that the army camp was destroyed by the typhoon and soldiers have camped out at the airport, which remained open.
An air force cargo plane was to deliver food packs, drinking water, blankets and other relief goods to the province.
The typhoon also devastated the nearby province of Albay, where heavy rains washed down boulders and mudflows from Mayon Volcano, engulfing about 150 houses in a single community in the town of Guinobatan, Albay Gov. Al Francis Bichara said."
Typhoon,"China issued its top warning for coastal areas of Zhejiang province Friday ahead of a strong typhoon carrying heavy rain and winds and expected to send an intense storm surge up the mighty Yangzte River.
Heavy rain was expected in Zhejiang, Shanghai and nearby provinces on Friday before Typhoon Lekima hits land on Saturday morning, then weakens as it moves north.
Parts of northern Taiwan closed offices and suspended classes at schools on Friday as the storm passed northeast of the island. The same area was hit by a magnitude 6.0 earthquake Thursday that caused minor damage but no deaths or injuries.
The red alert China issued is the most serious in its four-tired alert system, prompting authorities to prepare evacuations, suspend train and air travel and require vessels to return to port. In Zhejiang, ferry service had been cancelled and more than 200 tourists evacuated from popular Beiji island.
The National Meteorological Center said Lekima was gusting at 209 kph (130 mph) and traveling northwesterly at 13 kph (8 mph). Taiwan’s Central Weather Bureau put its sustained winds at 173 kph (108 mph) and said the bands of wind and rains around the storm’s eye were shrinking.
The State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters warned authorities overseeing seven provinces including Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangsu and Shanghai Municipality to make preparations and have emergency response systems ready to be deployed. In Zhejiang, nearly 5,000 fishing boats had been recalled to port, authorities reported.
An intense storm surge was expected to raise waters in the estuary of the Yangzte River, China’s mightiest, beginning Friday. Three main streams of the Yangzte River are likely to exceed alert levels and the commission overseeing the river for the Ministry of Water Resources has ordered efforts to prevent floods and oversaturation of levees along the river’s banks."

A tropical storm warning was in effect for Surf City north to Duck, an area that includes the Outer Banks barrier islands, meaning tropical storm conditions are expected sometime in the next 24 hours. Heavy rain, dangerous coastal surf conditions and rip currents are expected in the warning area, the hurricane center said. Arthur was about 260 miles south-southwest of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, moving toward the state at around 9 mph, the National Hurricane Center said in its 8 p.m. advisory. ""A turn toward the northeast with an increase in forward speed is forecast to occur later tonight or on Monday,"" the NHC said. ""A turn toward the east is expected on Tuesday."" The storm's center is forecast to stay ""well offshore of the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina"" Sunday night and move near or just east of the North Carolina coast on Monday, the hurricane center said. Arthur is forecast to turn away from the United States on Monday night and into Tuesday."
wildfires,"A pair of wind-driven wildlfires forced thousands of residents of Slave Lake, Alta., to evacuate their homes Sunday.
Residents of the town of 7,000 people were leaving via Highway 2 southeast to Athabasca.
The community's town hall has burned down, according to a local radio station, which said that it had lost its own building.
Slave Lake RCMP Staff Sgt. Mike Proctor said ""probably 30 per cent of the structures""  in the town had been destroyed by fire.
Alberta Sustainable Resources Minister Mel Knight said the evacuation of Slave Lake, which is about 200 kilometres north of Edmonton, was complicated by road closures.
Hundreds of firefighters are trying to save the town, Knight said. However, fire crews were hampered by heavy smoke and strong winds, which grounded water bombers Sunday.
Slave Lake's website said earlier in the day that the flames had breached the community's southern boundary.
""Please move toward large green areas, beaches or large parking lots like Walmart, Canadian Tire or the Sawridge Mall Parking Lot,"" the notice said.
""Do not attempt to leave on the highways if they are not open."""
Typhoon,"Former Hurricane Oscar, which peaked with winds over 100mph when it whipped through the Caribbean earlier this week, will pass near the British Isles on Saturday.
Although the weather system has now been downgraded, the Met Office has still issued a yellow warning for rain across western Scotland.
""Heavy and persistent rain” is expected across Scotland for much of the day, according to the Met Office.
Spray and flooding is expected to make driving much harder and journey times longer, and bus and train services will also be affected.
The first rains brought by the remnants of Hurricane Oscar will hit Northern Ireland on Friday afternoon, before the downpours and winds pick up early on Saturday morning for most of western Scotland and parts of north-western England.
By the end of Saturday the bad weather will have reached Wales and parts of eastern England as well, and BBC weather forecaster Nick Miller has warned that the winds could reach speeds of 60mph.
“Wherever you are, the breeze is picking up, particularly in the west. But it’s nowhere near as cold, but you may still see a touch of frost in eastern England,"" he said.
“The next system is a deep area of low pressure _ ex-Hurricane Oscar. It passes us to the northwest but we are close enough to get a windier day across the UK on Saturday and a very wet day in western Scotland.”
The mercury plummeted overnight, with the coldest spots seeing temperatures of -2C early on Friday morning. But the coming storms will see more mild temperatures, Mr Miller said, with temperatures of 8 or 9C on Saturday morning."
Typhoon,"Hurricane Hanna, the first hurricane of the season, makes landfall in Texas Hurricane Hanna, the first hurricane of the 2020 Atlantic tropical storm season, saw its sustained winds reaching 90mph before making landfall on the Texas coastline late yesterday. Post-landfall update towards the foot of this article. Hanna was a tropical storm on Friday and while it was expected to strengthen it was only given a low probability of reaching hurricane status. But hurricane Hanna defied some of the forecast models, to become the first hurricane of the 2020 Atlantic season on Saturday and intensify further as it moved towards the Texas coastline. Insurance, reinsurance and ILS market interests may have had a closer eye on tropical storm Gonzalo as yesterday forecasts suggested it could make it through the Caribbean, but now that storm is dissipating and hurricane Hanna has become the one to watch. Hurricane Hanna achieved sustained winds of 90mph with higher gusts to 110mph or more, as it moved slowly towards a landfall in Texas somewhere on the central Padre Island seashore. Hurricane Hanna could have strengthened further and the storms intensity was only limited by the amount of time it had over the warm Gulf waters. The modelled intensity forecast from TropicalTidbits.com showed a continued spike in wind speeds was expected up until landfall. The Texas coastal islands are already experiencing storm surge from hurricane Hanna, while the forecast is for coastal inundation totals of 2 to 6 feet above normal sea levels widely around the landfall region. Corelogic said in an update on hurricane Hanna that more than 14,000 residential properties lie in surge exposed areas near the area of the storms expected landfall. Significant rainfall totals are expected with hurricane Hanna, with the potential for isolated totals of 18 inches or perhaps more and life-threatening flash flood warnings raised for the southern Texas coastal region. Adding to the challenges, hurricane Hanna is coming ashore in a region of Texas where Covid-19 cases have been spiking in recent weeks, raising issues around distancing at evacuation centers should they be needed."
earthquake,"6.9-magnitude quake hits Papua New Guinea A powerful 6.9-magnitude earthquake struck eastern Papua New Guinea Friday, rocking residents across the pacific nation, the US Geological Survey reported. The quake struck at a depth of 85 kilometres (51 miles) near the eastern coast around 150 kilometres from the capital, Port Moresby, it said. People scrambled from office buildings in the capital after being jolted by the quake, which hit around 12:50pm local time (0250 GMT). Reports said the quake was felt in towns and cities across a wide swathe of the country and as far as Bougainville island, 900 kilometres off the coast. There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre initially issued a warning of potentially hazardous waves in nearby coastal areas, but later cancelled the alert."
wildfires,"Large wildfires raging throughout California have claimed at least 44 lives statewide, destroyed thousands of structures and prompted hundreds of thousands to evacuate. A fire actively burning in Northern California took at least 42 lives, becoming the deadliest fire on state record.
Large fires have scorched populated areas of California over the past week, including the Camp Fire, north of Sacramento, which incinerated the entire town of Paradise, and the Woolsey Fire, which burns northwest of Los Angeles. Firefighters on Monday also battled the Rocky Peak fire, which sprung up near where the Woolsey fire began and forced the shutdown of the Route 118 freeway. The Camp Fire has become one of California’s most destructive fires in at least a century, according to the Associated Press.
Wildfires are a natural and annual occurrence in California, typically appearing toward the end of the long, dry summers. In four out of five cases, people provide the igniting spark. At the same time, the environment has also become more flammable. As the state grows hotter and increasingly subject to prolonged droughts, and as more people live in high risk areas, the fires simply get bigger, more severe and more costly to put out."

The quake occurred at 8.49 PM at a depth of 10 kilometres near the India-Bhutan border, the NCS said.
In Sikkim, panic-stricken people rushed out of their houses. There was no immediate report of any major damage.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to the chief ministers of Sikkiam, Bihar and Assam and took stock of the situation in eastern India following the quake, government sources said.
""PM Narendra Modi is taking stock of the damage due to the earthquake. He is speaking to chief ministers of all 4 affected states and has already spoken to the CMs of Bihar, Assam and Sikkim,"" the sources said.
West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar said that he called up Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and enquired about her well-being as she is in Siliguri, where the tremors were felt.
""Had telephone conversation @MamataOfficial to enquire her well-being as Earthquake Tremors Felt In North Bengal. Hon'ble CM is at Siliguri presently. Relieved to learn all well at her end,"" he tweeted.
The Himalayas are prone to earthquakes and are known for high-seismic activity."
drought,"At least 200 elephants have died in Zimbabwe’s largest national park amid a severe drought.
Since October, the giant creatures have been found in Hwange National Park, although other parks have also been affected by the drought.?
Other species including giraffes, buffalos and impalas are also dying and the situation will only improve once rain returns, said Tinashe Farawo, a spokesperson for Zimbabwe National Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (Zimparks).
“Almost every animal is being affected,” he said. “Of course, elephants are easily noticed during patrols or game drives, but some bird species are seriously affected because they can only breed in certain tree heights and those trees are being knocked down by elephants.”
Many animals are straying from Zimbabwe’s parks into nearby communities in search of food and water.
Zimparks said 33 people have died from conflict with animals this year.
The drought has also taken its toll on crops, leaving more than half of the population in need of food aid.
The agency said it plans to move 600 elephants, two prides of lions and other animals from the Save Valley Conservancy in the south east of the country to less congested parks.
A pack of wild dogs, 50 buffalos, 40 giraffes and 2,000 impalas will also be relocated, Mr Farawo said."

earthquake,"Brief tsunami warning as 7.8 quake hits off Alaska: USGS WASHINGTON (AFP) - A 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck off the Alaskan peninsula, triggering a brief tsunami warning for areas within 300km of the epicentre. Sirens blared as residents were warned to move inland or to higher ground, reports said. The shallow quake hit at 0612 GMT Wednesday about 800km south-west of Anchorage, and around 96km south-southeast of the remote settlement of Perryville, the US Geological Survey said. ""Based on the preliminary earthquake parameters ... hazardous tsunami waves are possible for coasts located within 300km of the earthquake epicentre,"" the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre said. A tsunami warning for the Alaskan peninsula and south Alaska was later cancelled after only small waves were recorded. Warning sirens were sounded in Kodiak, the main city on Kodiak island, and several thousand people were evacuating lower lying areas, Sergeant Daniel Blizzard, with the Alaska State Troopers, told 11 KTVA News.  ""People are pretty concerned especially with an earthquake that big that close to Kodiak,"" he said. ""The last one, there was no wave whatsoever. This time, we’re not sure there is a wave, but we are preparing like there is one,"" Sergeant Blizzard said.  The first place predicted to see a tsunami wave, Sandy Point, had so far reported only ""a very small wave,"" Mr James Gridley, director of National Tsunami Warning Centre in Palmer, told Alaska Public Media (APM).  ""We’re not expecting a massive wave anywhere,"" he said. The quake however, was felt hundreds of kilometres away. ""Bed and curtains were going. Felt like a very long quake!"" one witness in Homer, Alaska, 643km from the epicentre, said on the quake monitoring website msc-csem.org. It was followed by several aftershocks, the strongest measuring 5.7. There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties.  The tremor appeared to be a subduction zone quake, where two tectonic plates converge, a seismologist said."

earthquake,"Significant magnitude 6.5 earthquake 22 km southwest of Pocito, Argentina An earthquake of magnitude 6.5 occurred only 8 minutes ago 22 km southwest of Pocito, Argentina, the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) reported. The quake hit at a shallow depth of 10 km beneath the epicenter near Pocito, Departamento de Pocito, San Juan, Argentina, late at night on Monday 18 January 2021 at 11:46 pm local time. The exact magnitude, epicenter, and depth of the quake might be revised within the next few hours or minutes as seismologists review data and refine their calculations, or as other agencies issue their report. A second report was later issued by the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC), which listed it as a magnitude 6.6 earthquake. Based on the preliminary seismic data, the quake should have been felt by everybody in the area of the epicenter. In those areas, dangerous ground shaking occurred with the potential to inflict moderate to heavy damage to buildings and other infrastructure. Towns or cities where the quake likely caused strong ground shaking include Moderate shaking probably occurred in San Juan (pop. 447,000) located 39 km from the epicenter, Santa Lucia (pop. 43,600) 40 km away, Villa Paula de Sarmiento (pop. 19,100) 43 km away, Chimbas (pop. 73,800) 44 km away, Caucete (pop. 33,600) 45 km away, and Albardon (pop. 20,400) 50 km away.

The quake's epicentre was recorded about 25 miles away from Reykjavik, in the Reykjanes Peninsula region, on Iceland's southeast coast.
The effects of the quake, which struck at a depth of around six miles, were felt in Reykjavik and the surrounding areas.
It was not immediately clear if there had been any damage to property or injury to life.
“Spent the morning shaking around the office, geologists all running around like excited puppies. So much shaking,” Rob Askew, a geologist at the Icelandic Institute of Natural Science in Reykjavík, tweeted."
wildfires,"FIREFIGHTERS have worked through the night to try to control a series of forest fires in the south of France, near Montpellier and Marseille.
The biggest, around Montaud and Saint-Bauzille-de-Montmel in the Hérault countryside north of Montpellier, destroyed more than 2,600 hectares of woodland and a dozen homes.
There have been no reported casualties.
Almost 1,000 firefighters remained on the scene last night to try to contain the fire and keep it away from the city and main roads.
Reinforcements were brought in from the Bouches-du-Rh?ne, Auvergne and Alpes-Maritimes.
Helicopters and Canadair firefighting planes were due to resume their work at dawn to contain the blaze and assess the damage. The fire was said to be under control shortly before midday.
Two smaller fires were reported nearby yesterday. One, between Mèze and Villeveyrac, destroyed 600 hectares of land, including four homes, a restaurant, a warehouse and a dozen vehicles.
The other was between Juvignac and Grabbels, north-west of Montpellier. Residents were evacuated as a precaution but the fire was quickly contained.
Travel delays in Bouches-du-Rh?ne
In the Bouches-du-Rh?ne, there are severe delays on the main rail line between Marseille and Toulon because of the forest fire yesterday near Cassis and La Ciotat.
Firefighters say the blaze is now under control. It spread through 250 hectares of land, fanned by a 50mph Mistral wind.
About a hundred people were evacuated from nearby homes and spent the night in a school gym. They should be allowed to go back to their homes later this morning.
Train services on the south coast mainline were suspended yesterday and are running today at a reduced speed. Some Toulon TGVs are starting from Marseille instead.
The A50 motorway remains closed this morning at Carnoux-en-Provence.

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA's Aqua satellite captured the infrared (IR) image taken a few minutes before the CloudSat overpass (the blue line). CloudSat overpassed just to the east of the center of the storm through the eye wall and. Heavy precipitation is distinuguished by the attenuation of the radar (lack of signal) in the lowest 5 km's of the CloudSat swath. A large area of moderate and light precipitation extends hundreds of kilometers south of the center of the storm. Individual cumulonimbus cells are evident underneath the anvil shield (towards the B label).

According to IMD, the monsoon was 39% deficient till June 22 despite marginal improvement over the last week. In its Sunday bulletin, the national weather forecaster said the monsoon advanced into parts of central Maharashtra, Marathwada and Vidarbha, remaining areas of Karnataka, Telangana, Odisha, Jharkhand, Gangetic West Bengal and Bihar, most parts of Chhattisgarh, and some areas of eastern Uttar Pradesh. But the weather system’s poor intensity has stoked a severe water crisis in many states, as half the country, especially states such as Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telengana and Andhra Pradesh, battle a drought-like situation..

earthquake,"Alaska Earthquake Revised up to Magnitude-7.6 JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — The magnitude of the earthquake that struck off the Alaska Peninsula and produced a tsunami with small waves was revised up to 7.6, officials said Tuesday. The quake Monday was first reported as magnitude-7.4 and was revised to a 7.5 before the latest revision. There was no major damage from the quake or tsunami. Don Blakeman, a geophysicist with the National Earthquake Information Center, said magnitudes are calculated using various mathematical formulas. He said revisions can occur as agencies contribute information or add more analysis. Different agencies also can report varying distances from the quake to nearby communities because earthquakes occur over a wide geographic area, said Michael West, director of the Alaska Earthquake Center. The quake struck in the Pacific Ocean, centered about 67 miles (118 kilometers) southeast of Sand Point, according to the Alaska Earthquake Center. Sand Point is about 800 miles (1,288 km) southwest of Anchorage. The earthquake was felt widely in communities along the southern coast, including Sand Point, Chignik, Unalaska and the Kenai Peninsula, according to the center. The quake produced a tsunami, and a warning was issued for about a thousand-mile stretch of the southern Alaska coast. The warning downgraded to an advisory just over two hours after the earthquake struck, and the advisory was lifted late Monday. Waves topped 2 feet (1 meter) in some areas, according to the National Tsunami Warning Center."

Numerous aftershocks of magnitude-4.9 and smaller have so far nucleated in the epicentral area at depths ranging from 4 to 7 miles (7 to 12 kilometers).

Only ground failures due to shaking in the foundations of a paved road (Route 40) have so far been observed. The epicenter is located in an uninhabited, rugged intermountain depression and surface deformation has not been reported after field checks."
other,"Hong Kong police are investigating an incident where a crowd watching the Olympics booed China's anthem.

Hundreds gathered at a shopping mall on Monday to watch a broadcast and cheer on Hong Kong fencer Edgar Cheung, who won gold in the men's individual foil.

When the Chinese national anthem was played, some in the crowd began jeering while others shouted ""We are Hong Kong"", video filmed at the scene shows.

It is illegal to insult the anthem under a recently passed law.

Anyone found guilty of flouting the national anthem law could be jailed up to three years and fined HK$50,000 (£4,600, $6,400).

Reports also said that the British colonial flag was flown and some had chanted protest slogans, which could possibly violate the national security law which forbids anything that incites ""secession"" and could result in life in jail.

Police sources told local media that they are collecting and examining footage from the mall's security cameras.

The incident took place in the same week as the conviction of the first person charged under the national security law.

Both laws were passed last year and have been met with huge controversy, with critics saying they clamp down on free speech.

But Hong Kong authorities and the Chinese government deny this and say the laws are necessary to preserve peace and patriotism.

Hong Kong saw widespread protests in 2019 when tens of thousands took to the streets demanding democratic reforms. Some of those demonstrations turned violent as protesters and police clashed.

Since then China has cracked down hard, introducing several strict laws aimed at curbing violence and what it deems as ""separatism"".

Hong Kong, a former British colony, was handed back to China in 1997.

Since then it has been ruled under the ""one country, two systems"" principle that preserves freedoms in the city that the mainland does not have.

Critics say those freedoms are now under threat with China's recent moves and the UK has accused China of flouting the terms of its handover agreement, but China denies this."
wildfires,"Smoke particles from the fires ravaging Australia have traveled more than 12,000 km, crossed an ocean and a mountain range and arrived in South America, meteorological institutions confirmed, after smoke was detected in Chile, Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay.
“From the afternoon of 6 January, a grey cloud and redder sunrises and sunsets could be seen in the sky [in Uruguay] due to the presence of small particles in suspension, more than 6,000 meters high, of smoke generated by the great fires in Australia,” said a statement from the Uruguayan Institute of Meteorology (Inumet).
Lucia Chiponelli, technical manager at Inumet, told SciDev.Net that despite the annual “bushfire season” in Australia, this was the first time smoke had been recorded arriving in Latin America in recent decades.
Fires raging in Australia since September have killed 24 people, destroyed more than 1,500 homes, and razed 6 million hectares of land, leaving more than 500 million animals dead. The bushfires, which are among the worst in the country’s history, have been fuelled by record temperatures — 41.9 °C on 17 December — and several months of intense droughts.
It comes after record fires in the Brazilian Amazon last year burned around 1 million hectares of forest between July and September, according to official statistics, while environmental organisations put the figure at more than double that.
NASA video shows the movement towards South America of a huge cloud of smoke from the Australian fires.
One of the consequences of such fires is that when air is heated it rises to the upper layers of the atmosphere, dragging particles from the burned materials along with carbon monoxide and other compounds derived from combustion.
This hot air reaches a height of up to 6,000 meters and from there joins the air currents of the Southern Hemisphere, Chiponelli explained. Smoke from Australia entered Latin America through Chile “because air circulation [in the Southern Hemisphere] always goes from west to east,” Soledad Osores, of the National Meteorological Service of Argentina, told SciDev.Net."
earthquake,"An earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 struck south of the Philippine capital early on Wednesday, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said.
The agency said aftershocks could be expected, but the earthquake, which struck at a depth of 112 km (69.6 miles), was unlikely to cause damage.
""Because this is deep, a large area experienced the quake,"" Renato Solidum, head of Phivolcs, told DZMM radio station, adding there was no threat of a tsunami.
The earthquake's epicentre was in Mindoro province and it was felt in the capital, Manila.
The Southeast Asian country is on the geologically active Pacific Ring of Fire and experiences frequent earthquakes, particularly in the south."
Typhoon,"Thick mud and debris coated many villages around the Philippine capital on Friday after a typhoon killed at least 42 people and caused extensive flooding that sent people fleeing to their roofs, officials said.
Troops, police, coast guard and disaster-response teams rescued tens of thousands of people, including many who flooded radio and TV networks and social media with desperate pleas for help.
Floodwaters receded and the weather cleared in many areas after Typhoon Vamco blew out into the South China Sea on Friday, but the military said it was still rescuing people trapped in some flooded communities.
Amphibious assault vehicles usually used in counter-insurgency operations were deployed for the rescue work, military chief of staff Gen. Gilbert Gapay said in a meeting with disaster-response officials.
“We’ll continue to look for the missing, help in damage assessment,” Gapay said.
The national police reported that the death toll had risen to at least 42 with 20 missing. The government’s main disaster-response agency, which waits for provincial reports and follows a laborious process of verifying casualties, reported a much lower death count, causing confusion.
Among the dead were at least 12 villagers who were dug out from mud and rockslides in the northern provinces of Cagayan and Nueva Vizcaya, police said.
After slamming into northeastern Quezon province, Vamco gained strength with sustained winds of 155 kilometers (96 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 255 kph (158 mph). It blew north of metropolitan Manila overnight Wednesday, toppling trees and power poles, swelling rivers, flooding residential communities and setting off landslides and storm surges.
In hard-hit Marikina city in the capital region and the towns of Rodriguez and Cainta in nearby Rizal province, several villages were inundated by water that reached the second and third floors of many houses, prompting hundreds of residents to flee to their roofs and call TV and radio networks or post desperate messages on social media. The panic was exacerbated by widespread power outages and loss of internet access.
Videos of Marikina showed a thick coat of muddy water covering roads and staining houses and cars. Residents carried appliances and furniture from their homes and used pails and shovels to remove the mud after the water receded.
In a televised meeting of Cabinet and disaster-response officials Friday, a reporter asked where President Rodrigo Duterte was, prompting an annoyed response from his spokesman."
drought,"A severe drought in the Czech Republic, which has reached historic levels in its fifth year, is worrying growers as it increasingly hits agriculture.
Scientists say the current series of drought, which began in 2015, is the worst in 500 years.
The temperature spikes have hit hardest in the eastern regions of Moravia and Silesia and the dry spell has forced many farmers to adapt fast. Some have had to cut fruit and wine grape production by 40 per cent.
In Central Bohemia — also hit hard — one grower, Lubo? Hrabánek of Farma Zadní Kopanina, says he has restructured his land to deal with the conditions.
He’s using smaller tracts for growing than the traditional multi-hectare square sectors that date from the communist days.
Hrabánek runs a family farm in the Bohemian Karst area whose main activity is animal production and breeding cattle, pigs and chickens. His four 10-hectare tracts also produce alfalfa, cereals and sometimes corn feed for his animals.
Despite recent rains, which have helped somewhat, Hrabánek has been “strongly impacted by the drought”, he said.
“Long-term care and care of the soil is important. Maybe that's why we focus anxiously on the principle of regular crop rotation.”
Besides using ancestral methods, he said “we try to grow crops that are not very demanding on water. We have not yet had to resort to artificial irrigation”.
The farm’s strategy has allowed it to avoid produce price hikes so far. “Our goal is not to spew production at all costs,” says Hrabánek, adding that his operation tries to tailor production to local needs.
Another farmer in the region — who produces artisanal honey, beets and greens that he markets directly in Prague — says water scarcity has forced him to irrigate year-round.
“We’re one of the only farms in our area still growing vegetables,” he said, noting that pumping from wells gets harder every year. Tensions are growing with neighbouring farms as the water table falls, he added.
Makers of craft beer in the Czech Republic _ a product increasingly in demand at home and abroad _ say they’ve been watching the prices and availability of hops, the country’s most famous export.
A representative of Chroust craft beer says the company buys Bohemian hops for its prime lagers and has not yet seen prices rising but acknowledges “growers are being hit. It could happen at any time”.
Winter wheat is at risk, say many farmers, but corn, with deeper roots, has fared batter. Meanwhile, other crops are likely to be ploughed under, unless more rain arrives soon.
The drought has also harmed grass and alfalfa production, needed for cattle feed, notes Robert Ku?era of the Agrarian Chamber of Ostrava.
An agency set up to study the drought and provide data, Intersucho.cz, reports that the Moravian-Silesian Region is in “one of the worst situations” with extreme drought at levels not seen for the last 50 years.
Authorities are supplying some towns with water tanks this year as they did in 2019, as other add-on effects include the spread of bark beetles and Moravian winemakers planning for a future shift from white wine production to red grapes, which are less dependent on water.
As for the effects on consumers, it’s clear that grocery prices are up but less certain is what role the drought has played, said Patrik Rozumbersky of market analyst company UniCredit. Rising food prices have more likely been driven by effects of the coronavirus, which held up shipments of produce at the country’s borders. A shortage of agriculture workers, who were blocked from travelling to the country from the east, is also a likely culprit, according to Rozumbersky.
Grocery chains Billa and Albert declined to comment on price changes but Prague consumers did appear to bulk up on packaged goods, which may also have had an effect _ though the Czech Republic did not see binge buying at the level witnessed in the UK and US during the COVID-19 lockdowns.
Consumer food price rises were also in line with current inflation reports showing a rate of 7.8 per cent, a rise from last year’s 6.4 per cent rate, according to Rozumbersky.
Czech crop prices, he adds, depend not just on local production levels but on “the quality of harvest in the whole European continent as the price of individual products is formed on the international market”.
At the same time, said Rozumbersky, “I think that the possible effect of drought might become more intensive later in the year as soon as the impact on the harvest is clearer.”
Industry organisations have been cautioning farmers too: the Czech Agricultural Chamber calls groundwater levels “strongly below normal overall,” noting that 71 per cent of wells are at unusually low water depths.
In addition, low water levels have hit key watersheds in the upper Oh?e, Lu?ická Nisa and Smědá river basins, which the chamber calls “strongly below normal.” Also drying up are natural springs, of which 79 per cent are suffering from “with severe or extreme drought”."
Typhoon,"Tropical Storm Gonzalo sets a record as it churns toward the Caribbean (CNN)Tropical Depression Seven strengthened into Tropical Storm Gonzalo on Wednesday, according to the National Hurricane Center. At 5 p.m. ET, the storm was about 1,110 miles east of the southern Windward Islands, packing winds of 50 mph and moving to the west at 14 mph. ""Given the increased organization of the system and its small size, Gonzalo's (pronounced gohn-SAH-loh) likelihood of becoming a hurricane is rising. Small storms are prone to more significant fluctuations in intensity, both up and down,"" CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward said. Strengthening will continue in the next day as the storm is expected to become the season's first hurricane by Thursday, the NHC said. The center is forecasting the storm to weaken slightly before moving over the Windward Islands. The storm may even fizzle after it moves over the islands, as many models are indicating, or it could continue to intensify into next week. It's still a little too early to tell exactly what it will do after it moves into the Caribbean. This is the earliest that a storm has received a name starting with the letter ""G"" since the United States began using a named-storm system in 1953. On average, the seventh named storm in a season is on September 16."
Typhoon,"Typhoon Goni is barrelling across the Philippines, bringing with it ""catastrophic"" winds and rain.
At least 10 people have died amid reports of storm surges, flash floods, power outages and blown-off roofs.
Goni made landfall as a super typhoon at Catanduanes island on Sunday at 04:50 local time (19:50 GMT Saturday) packing winds of 225km/h (140mph).
It has since weakened, but is still wreaking damage across the main Luzon island, home to the capital Manila.
President Rodrigo Duterte is monitoring the disaster response from his home in Davao city, a presidential spokesman said.
Mark Timbal of the Philippines' national disaster agency said that 19 million people may have been affected by the path of Goni. ""This 19 million already includes the populations in danger zones for landslides, flooding, storm surges and even a lava flow,"" he told the BBC."
wildfires,"A wildfire is burning out of control on North Mountain in Pendleton County in the Monongahela National Forest. More than 80 foresters and local firefighters are battling the blaze that started on Sunday near Upper Tract.
“[The fire] started on private land and it’s moved west/northwest on to national forest land, southwest of Petersburg,” according to Sarah Hankens with the U.S. Forest Service.
The blaze is 20 percent contained. It’s being called the North Mountain Fire and so far has destroyed 720 acres.
Bob Beanblossom with the U.S. Forest Service said crews are having a hard time reaching some parts of the fire because of the terrain in the Potomac Highlands.
“It is steep, rocky terrain. There are a lot of standing, dead trees that firefighters have to be careful of. It does certainly pose some hazards.” Beanblossom said half the battle is reaching those remote areas.
The fire is so large, the U.S. Forest Service has called in crews from out west.
“We have a lot of folks here from the Monongahela National Forest but there are crews from as far west as Oregon, Idaho and Washington,” explained Beanblossom.
Even more foresters are set to arrive from Tennessee, Virginia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Wisconsin.
Most of the fire is contained within the national forest and that’s where crews want to keep it.
“There is private property adjacent to the forest, not too far from where the fire is located,” said Hankens. “We do have personnel out on the fire line assessing both direct and indirect ways to create fire lines to try and keep the fire on national forest.”
So far, that part of Pendleton County has not seen any of the rain or snow much of the state received Tuesday morning. However, the humidity is high and that’s keeping the flames from spreading faster. Beanblossom said precipitation would drastically help the effort to gain control of the blaze."
earthquake,"Significant magnitude 6.6 earthquake 34 km southwest of Turt, Mongolia A magnitude 6.6 earthquake near Turt, Khankh, H_vsg_l Aymag, Mongolia, was reported only 12 minutes ago by the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ), considered one of the key international agencies that monitor seismic activity worldwide. The earthquake occurred at a shallow depth of 10 km beneath the epicenter early morning on Tuesday 12 January 2021 at 5:33 am local time. The exact magnitude, epicenter, and depth of the quake might be revised within the next few hours or minutes as seismologists review data and refine their calculations, or as other agencies issue their report. A second report was later issued by the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC), which listed it as a magnitude 6.2 earthquake. Based on the preliminary seismic data, the quake should have been widely felt by almost everyone in the area of the epicenter. It might have caused light to moderate damage. Moderate shaking probably occurred in Turt (pop. 2,100) located 34 km from the epicenter. VolcanoDiscovery will automatically update magnitude and depth if these change and follow up if other significant news about the quake become available.

earthquake,"An intermediate magnitude 5.2 earthquake was reported in the evening near Madang, Madang Province, Papua New Guinea.
According to Indonesia's Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysical Agency, the quake hit on Thursday 13 May 2021 at 9:32 pm local time at an intermediate depth of 72 km. The exact magnitude, epicenter, and depth of the quake might be revised within the next few hours or minutes as seismologists review data and refine their calculations, or as other agencies issue their report.
Our monitoring service identified a second report from the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) which listed the quake at magnitude 5.2 as well. A third agency, the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ), reported the same quake at magnitude 5.0.
Based on the preliminary seismic data, the quake should not have caused any significant damage, but was probably felt by many people as light vibration in the area of the epicenter.
Weak shaking might have been felt in Goroka (pop. 18,500) located 39 km from the epicenter, Madang (pop. 27,400) 69 km away, and Kainantu (pop. 8,500) 77 km away.

other,"India's north-eastern state of Assam is advising locals against travelling to neighbouring Mizoram in the wake of violent clashes at the border.

Six policemen from Assam died and 80 others, including officials, were injured on Monday when police from the two states fired at each other.

Officials from both sides, including chief ministers, have accused each other of provoking the violence.

Although there has been no fresh violence, tensions continue.

Mizoram has accused Assam of mobilising police along the border, and has asked the federal government to intervene.

Assam has said it has withdrawn its forces, but Mizoram is yet to do so. It also alleged, in its travel advisory, that video footage showed civilians from Mizoram carrying automatic weapons along the border.

The advisory cited ""personal safety"" as the main reason and asked Assamese people who live in Mizoram to ""exercise utmost caution"".

The violence follows months of tensions over a long-running border dispute. The federal government has been trying to mediate a truce between the states since 1994."
Typhoon,"A tropical storm has hit southern China, bringing heavy winds and rain and forcing the cancellation of dozens of flights. It is the second storm to hit the area in a week.
The provincial weather office in the southern island of Hainan says Tropical Storm Nalgae made landfall on Tuesday at about 12:30 p.m. (0430 GMT) with winds of about 55 mph (90 kph).
The airport in Sanya on the southern end of the tropical island said it had been forced to cancel or postpone dozens of flights.
Hainan was lashed by Typhoon Nesat last week, leaving hundreds of thousands without power and killing three people.
Both storms battered the Philippines before moving on to China."
wildfires,"Firefighters in Greece are battling outbreaks of wildfires on the outskirts of Athens and the southern Peloponnese peninsula which have forced villagers to flee.
The blaze outside the capital spread quickly on a hillside and blanketed parts of the city in thick smoke.
Separately, villages were evacuated in the Peloponnese as wildfires burned through rural land.
Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has asked citizens not to panic.
""Everybody needs to stay calm,"" he said.
""We will require volunteers contributing wherever is allowed by the fire brigade, who are in charge of the operations.
""We need to keep calm and we need a collective effort in order to deal with the different fires.""
The fires have already damaged several houses. Around 200 people had to be rescued from a beach after becoming trapped by the fires.
The government has requested assistance from other European countries. France says it is sending two firefighting aircraft following the call for help.
Authorities say that over 50 fires separate fires had broken out on four main fronts in a region stretching from the island of Evia, north-east of Athens, to the southern Peloponnese."
wildfires,"On May 16, 2011, tan and gray smoke spread hundreds of kilometers across Alberta, Saskatchewan, and the Northwest Territories in Canada. At 10:00 a.m., the Alberta government reported 116 fires burning in the province, 34 of them out of control. The following day, the total number of fires had dropped to 100, and the number of uncontrolled fires had dropped to 22. But four new fires had started to burn out of control.
The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Terra satellite took this image at 12:35 p.m. local time on May 16. Similar images of central Canada are available twice daily.
The top image shows a wide area to illustrate how far the smoke traveled. The lower image provides a closer view of a massive fire burning south of Lake Athabasca. Fire detections are outlined in red. Strong winds fanned the fires on May 15 and 16, sending thick plumes of smoke to the north.
The fires forced some energy and transportation companies to suspend operations, reported CBC News. Multiple oil and gas companies suspended drilling and moved their employees to safety. Oil transport was also hampered by a shutdown of rail service and a pipeline closure. Meanwhile, fires near Lesser Slave Lake destroyed 40 percent of the nearby town on May 15, including hundreds of homes and businesses and the town hall.
On May 17, CBC News reported that British Columbia was sending 200 more firefighters, in addition to the 130 firefighters already deployed to Alberta. Fire danger remained extreme throughout much of northern Alberta on May 17, the government reported."
earthquake,"At least 42 killed after strong quake rocks Indonesia's Sulawesi JAKARTA: At least 42 people were killed after a 6.2-magnitude earthquake rocked Indonesia's Sulawesi Island early on Friday morning (Jan 15), said authorities.  Hundreds more were injured when the earthquake struck in the early hours, triggering panic among the terrified residents of the island.  So far, 34 bodies have been hauled from beneath crumpled buildings in Mamuju, a city of about 110,000 in West Sulawesi province, while another eight were killed south of the area after the quake struck. ""We don't know how many more are missing,"" said Arianto from the rescue agency in Mamuju, who like many Indonesians goes by one name. ""There are still people trapped beneath the rubble."""
wildfires,"More than 640 fires have burned more than 3.2 million acres in Alaska this year, putting the state on pace for a record wildfire year. In 2004, Alaska’s worst fire season, about 6.6 million acres burned. More acres burned in the state last month than in June 2004.
The National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC), which makes predictions of the fire season for the federal government, expects the burning to continue. Wrote the agency:
“Alaska is in the heart of its fire season, and fire season could continue to be quite busy for another two months.”
The NIFC expects warmer temperatures and drier than normal conditions in the state.
Nearly one-third of all firefighters on active fires are in Alaska, according to the NIFC. More than 85 percent of acres burning are in Alaska.
According to a report from Climate Central, more fire is part of a trend: The fire season in Alaska is getting longer, the area burned is increasing and the number of large wildfires in the Arctic part of the state is growing.
Climate Central projects that the area burned in Alaska wildfires will double by mid-century.
More fires in the Arctic region are concerning to scientists because they could melt permafrost and release carbon that could accelerate global warming, said Todd Sanford, lead author of the study.
That’s because studies show wildfire can thaw permafrost beneath vegetation and soil and release sealed carbon, which could accelerate climate change though the effect is not certain.
Scientists are concerned that could create a feedback loop: More carbon in the atmosphere leading to warming temperatures, which thaws permafrost and leads to more carbon in the atmosphere."
drought,"The number of people facing severe food shortages is set to increase as the impact of drought, along with high food and fuel prices, continues to grip the Horn of Africa region, FAO warned today.
High levels of acute malnutrition are widespread and more than 8 million people in Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia are in need of emergency assistance.
The region has now experienced two consecutive seasons of significantly below-average rainfall, resulting in failed crop production, depletion of grazing resources and significant livestock mortality.
Chronic crisis
""The current crisis is not an unusual or chance event, but rather a chronic feature of the region. The challenge ahead is to empower farmers and pastoralists to adapt to the new realities of high variability of weather patterns and more frequent extreme weather events,"" said Rod Charters, Regional Emergency Coordinator for Eastern and Central Africa.
""Together with our partners of the Regional Food Security and Nutrition Working Group we have been preparing for this drought scenario since the failure of last year's short rains. FAO issued various alerts and has been supporting countries' preparedness plans in the Region.""
In Somalia, malnutrition rates are amongst the worst in the world, with one in four children in southern Somalia acutely malnourished. The drought is affecting most parts of the country, leading to livestock deaths and sky-rocketing food prices which make it increasingly difficult for poor families to feed themselves.
Currently, 2.5 million people _ one in three Somalis _ are in need of humanitarian assistance but with the ongoing conflict in the South, coupled with the poor outlook for the upcoming harvest, many more Somalis may fall into severe crisis.
In Kenya, more than 2.4 million people in the pastoralist and agropastoralist areas of northern and northeastern regions are estimated to be unable to meet their basic food and water needs. The food security situation is expected to further deteriorate as milk production in the drought-affected areas has collapsed and will not recover until October when the short rains are expected to start.
Furthermore, distances to water have doubled to 30-40 kms in many areas and conflicts have occurred over grazing resources, leading to loss of human lives and livestock, along with constrained market access. Emergency interventions are urgently required to mitigate the impact and protect further livelihood and nutritional deterioration.
In Ethiopia, a La Ni?a episode has resulted in the failure of two consecutive seasons of rain, water shortages, very poor pasture and marked deterioration in livestock conditions resulting in much reduced livestock prices in south and southeastern lowlands. In Borena Zone, on the southern border with Kenya, 220 000 cattle deaths have been reported. 
Additionally, the drought has also affected the 2011 ""belg"" cropping season to be harvested in June/July, which is expected to be very poor in the Oromia, Tigray, Ahmara and SNNP (Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples) regions.
At the beginning of June the number of people requiring assistance in Ethiopia was estimated at 11.4 million.  This includes 3.2 million people in need of emergency assistance and the 8.2 million people registered under the productive safety net programme.
In Djibouti, the ongoing drought coupled with very high staple food prices, high unemployment and increased rural-urban migration has worsened the food security situation at the household level. Water shortages in Djibouti City are also expected to become a serious issue over the coming months as the peak demand for water approaches."
earthquake,"“The Secretary-General extends his condolences to the families of the victims, as well as to the people and Government of Turkey”, UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said in a statement issued on Saturday. “He wishes those injured a speedy recovery”.
Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority, AFAD, said that 25 people were killed in Elazig province _ some 465 miles east of the capital, Ankara _ and four in the neighbouring province of Malatya.
And the country’s Health Minister recorded more than 1,450 injured people.
State media in Syria and Iran both reported feeling tremors in their countries, and local media in Lebanon said that Beirut and Tripoli also felt the quake.
More than 400 aftershocks have been recorded, 14 of which had magnitudes over 4.0, according to AFAD.

Hundreds of residents were left homeless or with damaged homes as rescue teams from neighboring provinces worked throughout the night with floodlights, using their hands, drills and mechanical diggers to remove bricks and plaster from collapsed buildings in search of survivors."
wildfires,"Three factors influence the impact of wildfire risk on property losses: fuel, slope, and access. The primary risk factor is a property’s proximity to vegetation—grass, trees, and scrub or brush—which provides fuel for a fire. Another important factor is topography, or slope, which influences the speed of wildfire spread. Finally, access—or specifically lack of access—is a critical factor. We’ve learned through experience that when properties are on dead-end streets or in single-access neighborhoods, firefighters face added challenges.
In addition to examining those risk factors, our analysis also considered time-dependent, weather-related factors. California experienced extreme drought conditions this past summer, with hardly any rainfall, and we found that to be significant. We also looked at wind patterns.
Even before the Valley and Butte fires erupted, our assessment had placed a large number of properties destroyed or damaged in their wake at high risk based on location and vegetation risk factors. Our modeling also established the Valley and Butte locations as areas with high loss potential before the fires, as illustrated by the map to the right.
As illustrated on the maps below, in both fires we found a significant correlation between burn severity and the proximity of vegetative fuel. As we see more frequently, people are building homes and other structures in the California foothills, former wildlands dominated by vegetation. In such an environment, or wildland-urban interface (or intermix, depending upon proximity to wildland fuels), properties are at a higher risk for loss.
A good number of properties destroyed or damaged in the Valley and Butte fires were located on steep slopes—and steeper slopes can increase the speed and intensity of wildfire. Winds also played a role. We detected anomalous wind patterns, with wind gusts in the area of 30 miles per hour, in both the Valley and Butte fires. Those winds had a role in spreading the fires and making it difficult for firefighters to control the flames. The Valley and Butte wind patterns, however, didn’t approach the magnitude of the infamous 60-mile-per-hour Santa Ana winds, responsible for fanning California’s most devastating wildfires."
Typhoon,"Hurricane center identifies tropical wave in Atlantic moving toward Caribbean The National Hurricane Center is tracking a tropical wave in the Atlantic Ocean, headed toward the Caribbean, but by Thursday afternoon gave it no change of forming into a tropical system. By the NHC’s 2 p.m. tropics update, the wave was located 200 miles east of the Windward Islands producing disorganized showers and expected to pass over the island later Thursday night. “Significant development is not anticipated due to inhibiting environmental conditions,” the NHC said, reducing its chances of formation to 0% in the next 2-5 days. The 2020 hurricane season has already seen three named storms, with two early systems, Tropical Storm Arthur and Tropical Storm Bertha forming in May. Tropical Storm Cristobal formed from a system that developed on the first day of the official season, which runs from June 1-Nov. 30. Whatever grows into the next tropical storm with sustained winds of 39 mph or higher would be named Tropical Storm Dolly."
drought,"As parts of the Western US emerge from one of the driest winter seasons on record, the expectation of yet another summer of wildfires will be familiar to many.
Scientists, in fact, are already issuing warnings of an increased risk of wildfires in places such as California for 2021, and other parts of the Western US, as the San Francisco Chronicle recently reported.
The region, where wildfires are increasingly common, is ripe for wildfires following a winter with extremely dry conditions _ and reportedly the third worst ever seen.
And it could for a single reason _ what is being described by scientists as the second worst drought for 1,200 years.
The Western US, a region at the front of the world’s fight against a warming climate, is on the verge of a “mega drought”, according to a report by CBS, following analysis of the US Drought Monitor and warnings from scientists.
And it could for a single reason _ what is being described by scientists as the second worst drought for 1,200 years.
The Western US, a region at the front of the world’s fight against a warming climate, is on the verge of a “mega drought”, according to a report by CBS, following analysis of the US Drought Monitor and warnings from scientists.
The period of so-called “mega drought”, of which the consequences are only starting to be seen, is thought to have begun in 2000, with peaks in periods of severe drought _ and wildfires.
As shown in figures from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the period was responsible for the two worst droughts to occur, in 2003 and 2013.
Figures for 2020-2021 are more alarming, with the amount of area being in a state of ""exceptional drought"" at 20 per cent _ wider than at any point for 20 years."
Typhoon,"Typhoon Talas dumped record amounts of rain Sunday in western and central Japan, killing at least 20 people and stranding thousands more as it turned towns into lakes, washed away cars and triggered mudslides that obliterated houses. At least 50 people were missing, local media reported.
Evacuation orders and advisories were issued to 460,000 people in the region, which is hundreds of miles (kilometers) from the country's tsunami-ravaged northeastern coast.
At least 3,600 people were stranded by flooded rivers, landslides and collapsed bridges that were hampering rescue efforts, Kyodo News agency reported.
Public broadcaster NHK showed a bridge swept away after intense rain caused a river to swell with brown torrents. People holding umbrellas waded through knee-deep water in city streets and residential areas.
The typhoon dumped record amounts of rain in some areas, and more was expected. It was the country's worst storm since one in 2004 that left 98 people either dead or missing, the Yomiuri newspaper said. By Sunday, Talas had been downgraded to a tropical storm.
Ten people were killed and 32 were missing in Wakayama prefecture alone, police said. One landslide there buried three homes; a woman was killed and four people were missing, but a 14-year-old girl was rescued from the debris.
In nearby Nara prefecture, seven people were reported missing after their homes were swept down a river, NHK said. A 73-year-old man died in Nara when his house collapsed in a landslide, police said.
The storm damaged Nijojo castle in the ancient city of Kyoto, tearing a large piece of plaster from the gate wall. The castle, a popular tourist destination, is designated an important cultural treasure."

Dozens more are missing, the country's disaster agency says, and it is feared the death toll could rise. Villages on the slopes of Fuego volcano were buried in volcanic ash, mud and rocks during Sunday's 16-hour eruption. Pyroclastic flows, which are fast-moving mixtures of very hot gas and volcanic matter, rushed down the mountainside and engulfed villages. President Jimmy Morales has declared three days of national mourning."
wildfires,"Wildfires have burned more than 3 million acres in Texas since the fire season started, more than any other year since the Texas Forest Service began keeping records.
The fire season officially began Nov. 15, said Forest Service Spokeswoman April Saginor.
Officials have reported 12,362 fires to the agency this season, Saginor said. Texas’ annual budget for fighting wildfires is $15.5 million. As of Sunday, the state had spent $126.7 million, Saginor said.
“This is an unusual year for us,” Saginor said. “We’ve surpassed 3 million acres. This is the first time that’s happened since we’ve kept records.”
Three million acres is more than twice the size of Delaware. The Texas Forest Service has kept records of acres burned since 1985.
Three fires scorched Texas Panhandle areas Sunday. The fast-moving Nance Ranch fire in east of Canyon consumed about 590 acres, Forest Service spokesman Jerry Rohnert said.
Randall County authorities issued a voluntary evacuation order during the blaze. Rohnert said residents of about 20 homes evacuated. All had been allowed to return to their homes Monday.
″(Firefighters) were careful letting people back because there’s a lot of straw and cow manure there,” he said. “That stuff burns for a long time.”
Three firefighters suffered minor injuries battling the blaze. Paramedics treated two for heat exhaustion and a third for minor cuts after a window in his vehicle shattered during the fire, authorities said. None required hospitalization."
Typhoon,"TS Gonzalo Update: Hurricane Watch ended for Barbados, SVG Barbados is no longer under a Hurricane Watch. The hurricane hunter dispatched to investigate Tropical Storm Gonzalo is not back as yet, however, there is preliminary data that indicates that maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. This is a decline from maximum winds of 50 mph at 11 am (July 24). As of 2 pm, the US National Hurricane Centre stated the center of Tropical Storm Gonzalo was located by an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft near latitude 9.9 North, longitude 54.8 West. Gonzalo is moving toward the west near 18 mph (30 km/h). A general westward to west-northwestward motion is expected during the next couple of days. On the forecast track, the center of Gonzalo will approach the southern Windward Islands tonight and then move across the islands on Saturday and over the eastern Caribbean Sea on Sunday."
Typhoon,"The tiny Caribbean island of Barbuda has been devastated by Hurricane Irma, the most powerful Atlantic Ocean storm recorded in history.
Around 90% of the nation’s structures and vehicles have been destroyed, killing at least one person, Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne said.
Irma passed over Barbuda early on Wednesday as a Category 5 hurricane.
The storm has left a trail of destruction across the eastern Caribbean, leaving at least eight people dead in total.
“Barbuda is literally rubble. The entire housing stock was damaged. It is just a total devastation,” Mr Browne told local news station ABS.
He said the island was “barely habitable” and the damage caused by the 185mph winds was “unprecedented”.
Around 60% of Barbuda’s 1,600 residents have been left homeless, Mr Browne said.
A two-year-old child was killed as a family tried to escape a damaged home during the storm."
Typhoon,"A typhoon causing deadly mudslides that buried people and destroyed homes on a Japanese island this morning has killed at least 17 people.
Typhoon Wipha swept up the Pacific coast, grounding hundreds of flights and disrupting Tokyo's transportation during the morning rush.
Dozens of homes were destroyed and more than 50 people are thought to still be missing.
Hardest hit was Izu Oshima island about 120 kilometers (75 miles) south of Tokyo. Rescuers retrieved the bodies of 13 people, most of them buried by mudslides, authorities said. “We have no idea how bad the extent of damage could be,” town official Hinani Uematsu added.
One woman from Tokyo died after falling into a river and being washed 10 km downriver to Yokohama, police said. Two sixth-grade boys and another person were missing on Japan's main island, Honshu, the Fire and Disaster Management Agency said.
More than 350 homes have been damaged or destroyed, including 283 on Izu Oshima, it said.
Typhoon Wipha, which stayed offshore in the Pacific, had sustained winds of 126 kilometers per hour (78 mph) with gusts up to 180 kph.
More than 80 centimetres (30 inches) of rain fell on Izu Oshima during a 24-hour period, the highest amount noted since record keeping began in 1991.
The rainfall was so heavy before dawn that people in the area could not ""see anything or hear anything,” Japan Meteorological Agency official Yoshiaki Yano said.
Izu Oshima is the largest island in the Izu chain southwest of Tokyo. It has one of Japan's most active volcanoes, Mount Mihara, and is a major base for growing camellias. About 8,200 people live on the island, which is accessible by ferry from Tokyo.

Packing winds of 42 meters per second at its center, it made landfall in the township of Wengtian in Wenchang City at 2:30 pm
The province has recalled ships, suspended flight and ferry services and closed schools to brace for Nesat, which is the 17th typhoon to hit China this year.
To ensure the safety of the children, all kindergartens, primary and middle schools in Haikou, capital of Hainan, suspended classes from Thursday noon to Friday.
Passenger ferry services across the Qiongzhou Strait have been suspended since Wednesday, while railway services stopped Thursday morning.
Meilan Airport in Haikou canceled 49 flights Thursday, while 18 were canceled in the city of Sanya.
Hainan has stopped selling bus tickets and encouraged passengers who plan to take buses in the next two days to return their tickets.
Chen Cheng, vice governor of the Hainan, ordered all fishing boats to return to harbor and fishermen to take shelter ashore.
In Wenchang, where the typhoon is expected to land Thursday afternoon, 2,606 fishing boats were recalled to harbor, while 31,323 people were evacuated.
The typhoon led to the death of at least 35 in the Philippines."
drought,"France experienced its driest July in more than 60 years, prompting the authorities to limit the use of water in more than two-thirds of the territory.
According to Météo France, from July 1 to July 28, average precipitation represented only 28 per cent of normal values ??across the country, making last month the driest July since 1959.
The southwest, Loire Valley and northeast were particularly affected by this significantly prolonged deficit of rains, known as a meteorological drought.
Prefectural decrees limiting the use of water have been issued in 73 of the country's 101 départements with 20 already experiencing crisis situations.
Hard-hit vegetation
As a consequence of this lack of rain, the country's soil is drier than usual, which is impairing the proper development of vegetation.
This agricultural drought ""must be watched"" in the northeastern region Grand Est, as well as in Auvergne-Rh?ne-Alpes, in Hauts-de-France and Lower Normandy, notes the country's meteorological agency.
This situation (drought, high temperature) also favours the development of wildfires.
Dry riverbeds
The largest French river, the Loire, is currently experiencing a sharp drop in its flow. The prefecture of the department of Maine-et-Loire, for example, has put in place many restrictions due to the situation.
Waterways have even completely disappeared in the northeast of the country, like the Doubs which is completely dry with the riverbed transformed into grazing ground for cattle.
This phenomenon had already been observed two years ago when this river had been completely dry for more than six months."
drought,"As more frequent river droughts will stretch the continent’s water resources, people, and economies must find new ways to adapt.
On 1 June 2018, results showed 4.5%. One month later, it was 10.8%; almost four months later, on 20 October, about 35.9% of Europe’s rivers were flowing abnormally low, the lowest since at least 1991. A summer of little to no rain left major water systems without their much needed water; repeated heat waves were also speeding up evaporation, leading to more water loss. This year, drought was already underway in April, in a big part of Central Europe, ranging from moderate to extreme, according to data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) and in many regions the drought has continued throughout June, making 2020 the third year in a row with unexpectedly dry conditions, according to the Copernicus Emergency Management service.
In the future, this might not be such an uncommon event. Halfway through this century, droughts are predicted to become more frequent, threatening a wide range of sectors, from water and energy supply to river transport and agriculture. “The Mediterranean sub-region, already suffering most from water scarcity, is projected to experience the strongest negative effects of climate change on drought conditions,” the Joint Research Center (JRC) Droughts Team told Euronews. “With increasing global warming, streamflow deficits in this region are expected to happen more frequently, become more severe and last longer,” the JRC team said. If global temperatures rise by 3 degrees, the researchers say an additional 11 million people and 4.5 million hectares could be annually exposed to droughts that used to occur only once every 10 years or so. “We see a strong divide within Europe, with more drought in the South and less in the North,” says Dr. Niko Wanders, hydrological extremes researcher at Utrecht University. “We’re observing that extreme droughts are likely to become more severe. This is caused by a combination of higher temperatures and more evaporation that results in bigger water losses,” says Dr. Wanders.
A noticeable factor comes from the fact that rivers are also receiving less water from glaciers, according to experts at the University of Birmingham. Warming in the European Alps in the last three decades, combined with less snowfall has resulted in a little bit under a 54% loss in glacier ice area since 1850; long-term predictions show further drastic reductions.
Rivers affected by drought lose more than water depth. Less rainwater means that river waters cannot dilute pollutants efficiently; this leads to higher concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as of heavy metals and microplastics, according to experts from the MaRIUS research consortium. The organic build up boosts algal production, leading to blooms that could make the water unusable for human use. Hotter river waters also hold less oxygen than cold ones, which harms fish and other aquatic fauna."

At 2 a.m., the storm was 105 miles south of Ocean City, Maryland, and 145 miles south of Cape May, New Jersey. Tropical storm warnings were in effect from the New Jersey coast through Long Island and Connecticut, with tropical storm force winds expected there within the next 36 hours.  In North Carolina, a high rip current risk is still in place for the Outer Banks for the weekend, but all other threats are diminishing. Tropical Storm Fay didn't stick around very long when it formed Thursday evening off the coast of North Carolina. Some strong surf and choppy waves were seen up and down the Outer Banks area on Thursday, particularly in Nags Head. It made for an interesting day for tourists. At the same time, it worried some business owners, who were on a little bit of an edge as they try to bounce back in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Fay's behavior was well received, mostly. Visitors trying to catch a break from COVID-19 and everything else in the world didn’t let Tropical Storm Fay ruin their trip Thursday to the Outer Banks. Most took a cue from mother nature and went with the flow."
wildfires,"Authorities are keeping a close eye on a bushfire in the Barmah Forest, near Nathalia, in northern Victoria.
The 39-hectare blaze started late yesterday in Hughes Lane at Yielima and it took 100 firefighters until just after midnight to contain it.
There are concerns the fire could flare up after a strong southerly wind change.
The cause of the fire is under investigation.
CFA incident controller, Phil Hawkey, says it is expected to take some time to extinguish.
""There's a number of large older trees that are hollow trees that are burning,"" he said.
""These trees are creating issues with us because they're spreading embers and so forth and they're going to continue burning through the day and possibly for the next few days."""
wildfires,"In recent weeks, nine major fires have ignited in the Brazilian Amazon, heralding the start of another fire season which, after a particularly dry year, experts say could be a bad one.
“The rainy season is already finished and it was a bad [dry] rainy season,” Marcelo Seluchi, a meteorologist in Brazil’s national space research institute (INPE) disaster monitoring center told Reuters. “The fire season will probably be bad.”
The first major fire of the year occurred on May 19, near the border of Serra Ricardo Franco State Park in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil along the southern edge of the Amazon, according to Amazon Conservation Association’s Monitoring of the Andean Amazon Project (MAAP).
So far, all nine of this year’s fires have occurred in the state of Mato Grosso and have averaged around 200 hectares (494 acres) each, an area the size of the Principality of Monaco."

The quake hit at a depth of 59km (37 miles), around 1,400km north-east of the Japanese city of Sapporo, USGS added. There were no early reports of casualties. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre initially said hazardous tsunami waves were possible within 1,000km of the quake’s epicentre. It said earthquakes of this strength in the past had caused tsunamis far from the epicentre. But later it said “only very small tsunami waves were generated by this earthquake and there is no further threat”. “Tsunami waves are forecast to be less than 0.3 meters above the tide level,” the center said in its advisory about risks to the coasts of Hawaii, Japan, Russia and the Pacific islands of Midway, the Northern Marianas and Wake Island. Meteorological officials in Japan issued no alerts, although they said there might be slight tidal changes. A tsunami watch alert was issued for Hawaii and later cancelled. The four southernmost islands of the Kuril chain _ Habomai, Shikotan, Etorofu and Kunashiri _ have been disputed between Moscow and Tokyo since the end of the second world war.

earthquake,"Thousands flee for safety and higher ground after island’s second quake in 24 hours
At least 37 people have been killed and hundreds injured following a strong earthquake that shook the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia early on Friday morning, prompting landslides and destroying houses.
Thousands of people fled their homes to seek safety when the 6.2-magnitude earthquake hit just after 1am local time on Friday morning. The epicentre was 6km north-east of Majene city in West Sulawesi.
Hundreds of buildings were destroyed or damaged, including a hospital, which collapsed with more than a dozen patients and staff trapped beneath it.
“The hospital is flattened,” said Arianto, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, from the rescue agency in Mamuju city, near Majene. Rescuers were also trying to reach a family of eight buried beneath the rubble of their destroyed home, he told AFP.
At least 37 people have been killed in Majene and Mamuju, and rescue workers fear the death toll will rise further. “Many of the dead are buried under rubble,” said Ali Rahman, the head of the local disaster mitigation agency in Mamuju. In Majene, 637 people were said to be injured."
Typhoon,"A massive typhoon crossed over Okinawa on Sunday, bringing winds more ferocious than even the typhoon-weary Japanese island has seen in decades.
Typhoon Bolaven, with wind gusts that reached as high as 259 kilometers per hour (161 mph), is the strongest to strike the region in nearly 50 years. And with a cloud field of 2,000 kilometers (1,250 miles), it is 20 times larger than Okinawa's length.
""It's been very, very severe,"" said storm chaser James Reynolds, who was on the northwestern coast of the island during the worst of the storm.
Tree branches were flying through the air amid torrential rain, he said.
Speaking to CNN early Monday morning on Okinawa, Reynolds said, ""It's been a long and rough night.""
""The eye of the typhoon actually crashed ashore just after dark. ... Like the rest of the population we all just kind of holed up in the strong and sturdy buildings which make up Okinawa,"" he said.
The infrastructure on Okinawa is designed to withstand violent storms. ""Everything's made of solid concrete,"" said Reynolds.
The last storm of this scale was Typhoon Naha in 1956."
wildfires,"Skies turned black and ash rained down as fires raged across southeastern Australia on Saturday (Jan 4), threatening power supplies to major cities and prompting the call-up of 3,000 military reservists.
The scale of Australia's unprecedented months-long bushfire crisis has shocked not just locals but the world.
More than 60,000 sq km have been burnt across the country - an area roughly twice the size of Belgium.
In comparison, close to 25,000 sq km of land was burnt in August in the Amazon, the world's biggest rainforest. Almost 8,000 sq km were burnt in California in 2018 in one of the US state's worst-ever wildfire seasons.
""We're in uncharted territory,"" New South Wales state Premier Gladys Berejiklian said.
""We can't pretend that this is something that we have experienced before. It's not,"" she said.
Since late September, 23 people have died - 17 from the most populous state New South Wales - with more than 1,500 homes have been damaged.
The latest fatalities were in Kangaroo Island - a tourist haven southwest of Adelaide - when two people were trapped in a car overrun by flames on Friday.
The death toll for Australia's wildlife is estimated to have hit 480 million in just New South Wales alone, according to a University of Sydney study. Experts fear the loss of animal life could be much higher than the estimates.
Strong winds and high temperatures continued to fuel hundreds of fires and cause chaos.
Bushfires took out two substations and transmission lines, prompting authorities in New South Wales to warn that an area home to almost eight million people and the nation's largest city Sydney could experience rolling blackouts."
Typhoon,"A storm called Potential Tropical Cyclone Six is expected is expected to bring rain and life-threatening flash flooding to the Cabo Verde Islands in the eastern Atlantic. The storm could strengthen into a hurricane by Sunday.
It has already been determined that it will be named Tropical Storm Florence as it gathers pace - becoming the seventh named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season.
The latest advisory for the storm — released at 7am Central time — said that the storm was 190 miles east-southeast of the southernmost point of those islands, and was moving at 12mph.
Compared to the types of major storms that have walloped American shores in the past, the as-of-yet-unnamed storm is relatively weak — clocking in with winds of 35 mph — but the system is expected to strengthen over the next week and may be classified as a hurricane in the coming days.
That said, tropical storm warnings remain in effect for Cabo Verde Islands Santiago, Fogo, and Brava, where residents can expect the potential for heavy rain and gusty winds later on in the day.
Where it goes from there is hard to predict — storms are fickle things and often change direction — but the hurricane centre’s long-range tracker pegs it as moving on a west to northwest path in the coming days. Early next week, the storm is likely to be far from the United States mainland."

Typhoon,"A super typhoon blew into the eastern Philippines with disastrous force Sunday, killing at least 10 people and triggering volcanic mudflows that engulfed about 150 houses before weakening as it blew away from the country, officials said.
Typhoon Goni blasted into the eastern island province of Catanduanes at dawn from the Pacific with sustained winds of 225 kilometers (140 miles) per hour and gusts of 280 kph (174 mph), threatening some provinces still recovering from a deadly typhoon that hit a week ago.
Goni barreled through densely populated regions and threatened to sideswipe Manila, which shut down its main airport, but shifted southward Sunday night and spared the capital, the government weather agency said.
At least nine people were killed in the hard-hit province of Albay, including a father and son. Villagers fled to safety as the typhoon approached, but the two apparently stayed put in the community in Guinobatan town where about 150 houses were inundated by volcanic mudflow.
“The child was found 15 kilometers (9 miles) away,” Albay Gov. Al Francis Bichara told DZMM radio, adding that the boy was swept away by mudflows and found in the next town.
He did not say whether there were any other residents trapped by the rampaging mudflows in the community and added that downed communications made it hard for people to communicate. The Office of Civil Defense reported that three Guinobatan residents were missing, but it was not immediately clear if they were from the mudflow-hit community.
The other deaths in Albay included a villager who was pinned by a fallen tree. One person was killed in Catanduanes province.

Ricardo Jalad, who heads the government’s disaster-response agency, had feared that the typhoon could wreak major damage due to its enormous force. The Philippine weather agency reinforced those concerns, saying that within 12 hours after the typhoon’s landfall, people could face “catastrophic, violent winds and intense to torrential rainfall.”
Residents were warned of possible landslides, massive flooding, storm surges of up to 5 meters (16 feet) and powerful winds that can blow away shanties. But after hitting a mountain range and repeatedly slamming into coastal provinces, the typhoon gradually weakened, although it remained potentially deadly as it blew out into the South China Sea, forecasters said.
One of the most powerful typhoons in the world this year, Goni evoked memories of Typhoon Haiyan, which left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million in the central Philippines in November 2013."
drought,"A severe drought is plaguing east China's Anhui Province, leaving crops damaged and drinking water supplies disrupted in some of the hardest-hit regions, local authorities said on Friday.
From Aug. 12 to Oct. 28, the province received an average rainfall of 83.9 milliliters, 60 percent less than the amount in normal years and hitting the second-lowest level since 1961, according to the provincial meteorological department.
A total of 45 cities and counties have been ravaged, with regions in three cities along the Yangtze River suffering from the worst drought in up to 50 years, said the provincial emergency management department.
The drought has affected over 1 million residents and damaged 400,000 hectares of crops, inflicting a direct economic loss of 1.6 billion yuan (227 million U.S. dollars), it said.
The provincial meteorological authority has been using cloud seeding for artificial rain as no precipitation is forecasted in the coming week in most of Anhui.
The provincial water resources department has ordered lower-level authorities to unveil plans to ensure drinking water supply for residents and livestock."
wildfires,"Hundreds of people were forced to flee their homes after a wildfire broke out in the Texas panhandle.
The fire started around 4 p.m. Sunday (5 p.m. ET) near Fritch in Hutchinson County. It destroyed more than 100 homes and continued to rage into the night despite being 75 per cent contained by firefighters.
""We have more than 100 homes confirmed destroyed but we won't know how many have actually been burned until it gets light,"" Fritch Police Chief Monty Leggett told NBC News at 4:30 a.m. local time on Monday (5:30 a.m. ET)
Leggett said that between 300 and 400 people had been forced to leave their houses in the surrounding area of Fritch and an unknown number were without power. Officials had considered evacuating the 2,100-population city itself but decided late Sunday it was not necessary.
There were no deaths or injuries related to the blaze, the police chief added.
Every fire department in Hutchinson County was called to the blaze and people were evacuated to at least three schools and churches being used for shelter across the area.
""Words cannot express the sadness and fear you have for the people’s homes, belongings and lives,"" Vicki Bybee, one of the evacuees, told the Amarillo Globe News.
The blaze had consumed more than 1,500 acres and around 100 emergency service personnel were on the ground battling to contain it as of 4:30 a.m. local time. The Texas Forestry Service was scheduled to assist the effort with water drops from two aircraft on Monday, Leggett added."

Gonzalo is the seventh named storm to form in the Atlantic Basin and is heading into the Caribbean, but ""the small size of this system makes is susceptible to significant fluctuations, both upward and downward,"" the latest NHC public advisory said. But as Gonzalo moves quickly west into the Caribbean, ""interests in the Windward Islands should monitor the progress of this system,"" the latest NHC public advisory said. The agency has issued no warnings or watches yet for Gonzalo. Current NHC predictions have Gonzalo moving over Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela by early Sunday morning into the mouth of the southern Gulf of Mexico. And while the NHC said it expects strengthening to continue ""over the next couple days with a levelling off"" it is too soon to gage what impact if any it will have on oil and gas infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico."

earthquake,"Strong earthquake hits lake in northern Mongolia A strong 6.7-magnitude earthquake has struck a lake along the Russia-Mongolia border, with shaking felt across the region, seismologists and residents say. There were no immediate reports of injuries. The earthquake struck at 5:33 a.m. local time on Tuesday and was centered in Lake Kh_vsg_l in northern Mongolia, about 55 kilometers (34 miles) from the border with Russia, or 288 km (179 miles) southwest of Irkutsk. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) put the earthquake’s magnitude at 6.7, down from an earlier estimate of 6.8. It said the quake struck at a depth of just 10 km (6 miles) and was felt across the region on both sides of the border. The area near the epicenter is not heavily populated but is home to a number of villages near the lake, including Hatgal and Turt, which have a combined population of up to 5,000 people. There were no immediate reports of casualties. A 40-year-old resident in Darkhan, a city about 423 kilometers (263 miles) southeast of the epicenter, was woken up by the earthquake. “It was the strongest I’ve felt in my whole life,” the resident told BNO News. Indra Ganbaatar was also sleeping when the earthquake was felt in the capital Ulaanbaatar. “I felt a very strong tremor and woke up,” Ganbaatar said. “My whole bed was shaking. It was really scary. I was really scared.” Nil-Erdene Bayanburd, also from Ulaanbaatar, felt the quake as well. “Our dangly lights and lamps were swinging slightly, the desk was pretty shakey and everyone felt it in different regions across Ulaanbaatar,” Bayanburd said. Tuesday’s tremor was one of the strongest earthquakes to hit northern Mongolia in recent history."

Only one home burned down in the 12,000 or so acres where Horry County Fire and Rescue was working during the 2009 wildfire.
""No other homes were destroyed and you know I think that's a good testament to what we did in the area out there in Horry county,"" said Horry County Fire Chief Gary Aldermann.
Since the 2009 wildfire the county bought equipment better suited for fighting wildfires for its new wildfire hub station, which was built in Conway.
New uniforms and wildfire gear were purchased with federal grant money.
""It (the new uniform) allows them to not go and be as fatigued right away because of the weight of the equipment and the ability to that it breathes better than regular structure fire gear,"" said Aldermann.
Aldermann says money from another federal grant allowed the department to hire 18 more firefighters.
In total, 30 firefighters have gotten advanced training on fighting wildfires and have helped form the Horry County Wildfire Team.
Aldermann says the county is also working to improve communications with the S.C. Forestry Commission and local municipalities."

“Firefighters made excellent progress today by strengthening fire lines and establishing five percent containment on the 16,553 acre fire. The Washington Fire, 8 miles south of Markleeville, CA, experienced lighter winds and burning conditions more conducive to aggressive ground and air suppression actions.
“Several campgrounds along Highway 4 to the north end of Markleeville remain evacuated. For the safety of the public and active fire suppression activities, Highways 4 and 89 in the Monitor Pass area remain closed, as do the Turtle Rock and Indian Creek campgrounds. Markleeville residents remain under an evacuation advisory issued by Alpine County Sherriff’s office. No mandatory evacuations are in effect at this time.
“Twelve helicopters and 8 air tankers support the suppression effort on the fires, dropping retardant, ferrying equipment and supplies, transporting firefighters, and providing essential surveillance of areas far inside the perimeter not safely accessible by foot. Other key resources include 19 engines, 10 water tenders, and 19 crews. There are approximately 681 personnel assigned to the fire.
“Firefighters made significant progress around the entire fire perimeter, with their priority being the line along the north of State Highway 89. The primary tactical priority is to prevent the fire from reaching Markleeville. The next priorities are to buttress the lines along Wolf Creek and the Leviathan Mine reclamation site.”"
Typhoon,"Louisiana on Sunday was picking up the pieces after Hurricane Delta swept through, wreaking havoc on a region already devastated by Hurricane Laura six weeks ago.
Two people were confirmed on Sunday to have been killed after Delta made landfall on Friday evening near the coastal town of Creole, with top winds of 100mph. 
Delta on Friday and Saturday moved over Lake Charles, a city where Hurricane Laura damaged nearly every home and building in late August.
Aerial photographs showed the destruction around Creole, with roofs torn from buildings and communities surrounded by floodwater.
John Bel Edwards, the governor of Louisiana, said the storm dumped more than 15 inches of rain on Lake Charles over two days, and more than 10 inches on Baton Rouge.
Edwards said 3,000 Louisiana National Guard soldiers were called up to clear roads and distribute meals and tarps.
An estimated 380,000 people were left without power on Sunday.
Delta rapidly weakened once it moved onto land and slowed to a tropical depression on Saturday."
wildfires,"Cool and relatively moist, Swedish summers aren’t known for promoting wildfire. Fires occur in most years, but not on the scale or intensity of the blaze that raged through boreal forests in August 2014.
It’s not clear how it got started, but fast-growing fire has consumed V?stmanland since July 31. In a week, the blaze grew to become the largest Sweden has seen in four decades. As of August 8, it had charred more than 150 square kilometers (60 square miles), killed one person, and forced thousands to evacuate their homes.
The Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat 8 captured this natural-color image of the fire on August 4, 2014. Multiple smoke plumes rise from the perimeter of the fire and blow northwest in the wind. Burned forest appears brown; unaffected forests are dark green; farmland is light green; and fallow fields are tan.
Hot and dry weather exacerbated the fire, stressing vegetation and priming it to burn. With a high-pressure system parked over Scandinavia, oppressive heat emerged across Sweden in July and August, bringing record or near-record temperatures to many towns and cities. In Sala, a city close to the fire, temperatures soared to 34.7°C (94.5°F) on August 5. Average temperatures are about 70°F (21°C) in early August.
Wildfires aren’t common or widespread in Sweden. According to a report published by the International Forest Fire News, only a few hundred hectares (100 hectares is equivalent to 1 square kilometer) generally burn during the nation’s wet summers, and a few thousand hectares burn during dry summers. That’s less than 0.02 percent of Sweden’s overall forest cover."
wildfires,"A giant bushfire on the edge of Sydney, which has blanketed the city in smoke causing a spike in respiratory illnesses and the cancellation of outdoor sports, will take weeks to control but will not be extinguished without heavy rains, firefighters said.
Thousands of weary firefighters, who have been battling wildfires for a month, have been fighting nearly 100 blazes in New South Wales state.
The mega fire north of Sydney, Australia‘s largest city, was created on Friday when several fires merged and was now burning across 335,000 hectares.
“We need flooding rain to put these fires out. That’s really what is going to stop it,” said the New South Wales Rural Fire Service. “These will take many weeks to put out.”
Wildfires are common in Australia during the hot summer, which begins in December, but this year the fires started much earlier, blamed on soaring temperatures, dry winds and arson.
A three-year drought has left much of Australia tinder dry.
The fires around Sydney have been pumping such vast amounts of smoke into the air that they appear as significant rain on the radars, the Bureau of Meteorology said on Twitter.
New South Wales Health said late on Friday that some 1,140 people had sought medical assistance for breathing issues or asthma in the past week _ a quarter more than in a typical week. NSW Ambulance fielded about a third more calls.
Six people have been killed, nearly 700 houses burnt down and millions of hectares of land razed.

The Catalan regional government said another 70-year-old French man died from a heart attack as he helped battle the fires near his home in the town of Llers.
The health department said a 64-year-old French national who suffered 80 percent burns on Sunday has since died of his injuries.
Several of the people injured were said to be in a serious condition.
The blaze broke out just after noon on Sunday near the town of La Jonquera close to the French border and has burnt out 12,000 hectares (30,000 acres) of land, the Catalan government said.
Regional government spokesman Felip Puig said on Sunday that train services in the region were suspended, and several roads linking Barcelona to France were closed because of the fires.
Spain has suffered its driest winter in 70 years, putting it at a higher risk than usual of forest fires this summer.
Earlier this month, a wildfire ravaged 50,000 hectares in the eastern Spanish region of Valencia."
earthquake,"Major quake shakes southern Mexico, at least six killed LA CRUCECITA, MEXICO (REUTERS) _ A powerful earthquake of magnitude 7.4 struck southern Mexico’s Pacific coast on Tuesday (June 24), killing at least six people and cutting off isolated villages, as well as causing damage to buildings hundreds of kilometres away in Mexico City.  The fatalities were near the quake’s centre in Oaxaca, a mountainous state known for its coffee, mescal and Spanish colonial architecture.  A Reuters witness in the tourist town of La Crucecita, which Mexican authorities said was the epicentre of the earthquake, saw anxious residents standing outside their homes on the streets many hours after the tremor as they feared deadly aftershocks.  Many houses were scarred by huge cracks across walls and residents sought to clear debris from the streets, the Reuters witness added. About 200 houses in the area were damaged, including 30 that were badly impacted, a local official said.  “We lost everything in one moment to nature,” said Vicente Romero, an owner of a stationery store whose house suffered vast structural damage. “This is our life’s work.” Rockfalls blocked the winding mountain roads between the state capital of Oaxaca city and the coast. Rescue workers have not reached all villages reported to have suffered damage, raising fears that more people may be injured or killed."
Typhoon,"A typhoon caused deadly mudslides that buried people and destroyed homes on a Japanese island yesterday before sweeping up the Pacific coast, grounding hundreds of flights and disrupting Tokyo's transportation during the morning rush. At least 17 deaths were reported and nearly 50 people were missing.
Hardest hit from Typhoon Wipha was Izu Oshima island, which is about 120 kilometres (75 miles) south of Tokyo. Rescuers found 16 bodies, most of them buried by mudslides, police and town officials said. Dozensof homes were destroyed, and about 45 people were missing.
A woman from Tokyo died after falling into a river and being washed 10 kilometres (6 miles) downriver to Yokohama, police said. Two sixth-grade boys and another person were missing on Japan's main island, Honshu, the Fire and Disaster Management Agency said.
More than 350 homes were damaged or destroyed, including 283 on Izu Oshima, it said.
The typhoon, which stayed offshore in the Pacific, had sustained winds of 126 kilometres per hour (78 miles per hour), with gusts up to 180 kph (110 mph), before it was downgraded to a tropical storm.
More than 80 centimetres (30 inches) of rain fell on Izu Oshima during a 24-hour period ending yesterday morning, the most since record-keeping began in 1991."
earthquake,"Large earthquake off Alaska prompts tsunami fears, fleeing A magnitude 7.5 earthquake prompted a tsunami warning Monday for a nearly thousand-mile stretch of Alaska’s southern coast, with waves over 2 feet at the nearest community as the threat subsided. The quake was centered near Sand Point, a city of about 900 people off the Alaska Peninsula where wave levels late Monday topped 2 feet (0.61 meters), according to the National Tsunami Warning Center. The warning was downgraded to an advisory just over two hours after the quake hit. “It was a pretty good shaker here,” said David Adams, co-manager of Marine View Bed and Breakfast in Sand Point. “You could see the water kind of shaking and shimmering during the quake. Our truck was swaying big time.” Adams didn’t take any photos or video: “It just kind of happened all of a sudden.” The quake struck in the North Pacific Ocean just before 1 p.m. It was centered about 67 miles (118 kilometers) southeast of Sand Point, according to the Alaska Earthquake Center. The community is about 800 miles (1,288 km) southwest of Anchorage. The quake was recorded at a depth of 19 miles (30 kilometers). The National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, Alaska, said the tsunami warning — and later advisory — was in effect for roughly 950 miles (1,529 kilometers), from 40 miles (64 kilometers) southeast of Homer to Unimak Pass, about 80 miles (129 km) northeast of Unalaska. The quake was felt widely in communities along the southern coast, including Sand Point, Chignik, Unalaska and the Kenai Peninsula, according to the Alaska Earthquake Center, which said a magnitude 5.2 aftershock was reported 11 minutes later, centered roughly in the same area. Patrick Mayer, superintendent of the Aleutians East Borough School District, said parents picked up their children from Sand Point School, which also served an evacuation point. The earthquake was felt to varying degrees at the other four schools in the district, the closest of which is 90 miles away, he said. Mayer said a school bus was dispatched to a fish processing facility to bring workers to the school since it’s on high ground. The workers were to wear masks to protect against the spread of the coronavirus, he said, in a community where there have been only “limited cases.” Public safety officials in King Cove urged residents to remain vigilant after the warning was downgraded and to stay off the beach and out of harbors and marinas. Waves by late afternoon in King Cove were less than 2 feet (0.61 meters), according to the National Tsunami Warning Center. The size of the quake was originally reported to have been a magnitude of 7.4, but was revised to a 7.5, said Paul Caruso, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey. He said an earthquake of this size, in this area, is not a surprise. “This is an area where the Pacific Plate is subducting underneath the North American Plate. And because of that, the Pacific Plate actually goes underneath the North American Plate, where it melts,” Caruso said, noting that’s why there are volcanoes in the region. “And so we commonly have large, magnitude 7 earthquakes in that area.”"
earthquake,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- One of the biggest earthquakes to hit the South Pacific in modern history forced thousands of people in New Zealand to evacuate and triggered tsunami warnings across the world Friday, but it did not appear to cause injuries or major damage because it struck in remote ocean.
The magnitude 8.1 quake was the largest in a series of tremors that hit the region over several hours, including two earlier quakes that registered magnitude 7.4 and magnitude 7.3.
The earthquakes triggered warning systems and caused traffic jams and some chaos in New Zealand as people scrambled to get to higher ground, but their remoteness meant they did not appear to pose a widespread threat to lives or infrastructure.
The largest quake struck about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) off the coast of New Zealand. One of the earlier quakes hit much closer to New Zealand and awoke many people as they felt a long, rumbling shaking.
“Hope everyone is ok out there,” New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern wrote on Facebook during the night.
After the largest quake, civil defense authorities in New Zealand told people in some coastal areas to immediately get to higher ground. They said a damaging tsunami was possible, and waves could reach up to 3 meters (10 feet).
Emergency Management Minister Kiri Allan told reporters that people had followed the advisory.
“They felt the long or strong earthquakes and they knew to grab their bag and head into the highlands,” she said. “I can only thank and acknowledge the tireless efforts of the men and women from up and down the coast who knew how to act, when to act, and what to do.”
She warned that the threat could remain throughout much of the afternoon and people should not return home until authorities gave the all-clear. Allan said evacuations took precedence over coronavirus distancing measures.
The U.S. Tsunami Warning System also cautioned the quake could cause tsunami waves of up to 3 meters (10 feet) in Vanuatu and up to 1 meter (3 feet) in Australia, Fiji, French Polynesia and as far away as Mexico and Peru.
The U.S. Geological Survey said it was centered near the remote Kermadec Islands at a depth of 19 kilometers (12 miles).
The agency said in a report that the quake occurred at the intersection of the Pacific and Australia tectonic plates and eclipsed the largest quake previously recorded in the region, a magnitude 8.0 in 1976.
It said the interaction between the plates creates one of the most seismically active regions in the world, and it has recorded 215 quakes there above magnitude 6.0 over the past century.
Jennifer Eccles, an earthquake expert at the University of Auckland, said the quake was at the top end of the scale for those involving only the Earth's ocean crust.
“This is about as big as it gets,” she said.
She said most quakes larger than magnitude 8.0 tend to occur when a section of more robust continental crust is involved.
The U.S. Geological Survey said the magnitude 7.4 quake was likely a “foreshock” that contributed to the larger quake but that the first quake that hit closer to New Zealand was too far away in time and distance to have directly contributed.
Officials in New Zealand had hours earlier issued a tsunami warning for coastal areas after the first quake struck off its northeastern coast at about 2:30 a.m. Friday. There were no immediate reports of serious damage or casualties, and the warning was lifted just before the largest quake hit.
The U.S. Geological Survey said the first quake was centered at a depth of 21 kilometers (13 miles) under the ocean about 174 kilometers (108 miles) northeast of the city of Gisborne.
It was widely felt in New Zealand, and residents in the major cities of Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch reported being shaken awake.
In 2011, a magnitude 6.3 quake hit the city of Christchurch, killing 185 people and destroying much of its downtown."
Typhoon,"Typhoon Nanmadol has killed at least eight people in the Philippines and is heading to Taiwan, officials have said.
Fierce winds and rain caused floods and landslides, with 20 major roads blocked and several bridges collapsing, said civil defence office head Benito Ramos.
Among the dead were two children killed when a rubbish tip wall collapsed in the northern mountain city of Baguio.
Nanmadol is expected to make landfall in eastern Taiwan on Monday morning, its Central Weather Bureau said.
It said the storm was packing gusts of 137 km/h (85mph) and moving north at 10 kilometres an hour.
The island has evacuated 2,500 villagers from its eastern and southern regions, with schools and offices closed, flights cancelled and public transport disrupted.
Authorities in the Philippines - where the storm raged at up to 230 km/h (145mph) - are focusing on rescue operations, with states of emergency declared in many areas.
An average of 20 storms and typhoons hit the Philippines annually, with dozens killed during the last storms - Nock-ten and Muifa - in July."
drought,"Across northern China swathes of land are dry, parched by drought.
In some areas these are the driest conditions in a lifetime. Snowfalls in recent days have helped a little, but still, across huge areas of land, water is in short supply.
The countryside is dotted with empty dams. Standing on top of one, near Qufu in Shandong Province, you can see just a tiny muddy pool in the centre of a dam that is hundreds of metres long.
Sitting rusting on the earth is a small boat. Along the dry dam floor people have been planting rows of crops because it has been like this for so long.
Li Si Jiao, 77, his back stooped with age, shuffles slowly along a path on top of the dam. His face is weathered and creased with lines. He gestures at the dam and says the water used to stretch all the way to the village in the distance, but no more.
This is China's breadbasket, the heart of its grain growing lands, and all around are Shandong's wheat fields. They are full of lines of seedlings, sprouting from the ground, but wilting and yellowing.
A grey, polluted haze hangs in the air. Every few hundred yards small groups of men and women are working to try to save their crops from the drought.
China is the world's biggest grower and consumer of wheat. In normal years it is self-sufficient. But if it has to import grain this year then that will have an impact far afield.
Already just the warnings of a possible shortfall in China's crop have put pressure on global wheat prices."
Typhoon,"Tropical storm Fay insured loss estimated at $400m by KCC Recent tropical storm Fay, which took the record as the earliest F named storm in history as it targeted the U.S. northeast region, is estimated to have caused an insurance market loss of roughly $400 million by catastrophe risk modeller Karen Clark & Company (KCC). Tropical storm Fay formed off the North Carolina coast on July 9th and headed north, with the storm gaining structure and wind speed strength to become a strong tropical storm with sustained winds of around 60mph before it headed for a landfall in the northeast U.S. on July 10th. Tropical storm Fay made landfall just north of Atlantic City, New Jersey, and continued north through New York, with its sustained winds weakening as it passed through this area of particularly high insurance and reinsurance market exposure. KCC explained that parts of Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York all saw damaging winds from tropical storm Fay. Some power outages were reported in New York and New Jersey, although these were largely quickly resolved. The most likely impacts from tropical storm Fay are light wind damage, but some structural damage is possible from trees falling on buildings, KCC said. The catastrophe risk modeller highlighted that in New York City alone hundreds of downed trees were reported, while parts of New Jersey and Pennsylvania, among other areas, also experienced tree damage that resulted in infrastructure disruption. Low levels of storm surge were also seen along a swathe of the U.S. eastern seaboard from South Carolina to New York. Having run its catastrophe risk model, KCC believes that tropical storm Fay will result in an estimated close to $400 million of losses that fall to the insurance market. At that low-level losses to reinsurance capital would be expected to be minimal. KCC said its estimate includes privately insured wind and storm surge damage to residential, commercial and industrial properties, as well as automobiles. But it does not include any NFIP losses."
wildfires,"A massive brushfire, the worst in Israel’s history, raged unchecked for more than eight hours Thursday, burning thousands of acres of land, forcing villages to evacuate, and killing up to 40 people when their bus was engulfed in flames. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the blaze as “a catastrophe, the likes of which we have not yet known”.
He appealed to Russia, Cyprus, Greece and Italy for help in putting out the fire, which began on the slopes of the Carmel hill, southeast of Israel’s port city of Haifa, and rapidly spread.
Cyprus and Greece agreed to dispatch firefighting helicopters.
Some nine hours after the blaze was estimated to have begun exhausted firefighters, those from Haifa reinforced by teams from all over Israel, and by soldiers, were still struggling to bring it under control, but without success.
“We’ve lost control of the fire,” a spokesman for Haifa’s firefighting services was quoted as saying.
Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovich said it was impossible to say when the fire could be brought under control. However, firefighters were speculated that as the fire spread west a major road linking Haifa with Tel Aviv to the south could act as a natural firebreak, or, failing that, the sea would.
At least 22 people were confirmed dead, but other accounts put the number as high as 40.
The fatalities were prison guards who had been drafted to help evacuate the 500 prisoners from a jail in the path of the flames. Their bus, with 50 people on board, was trapped by a falling tree and 40 of them burned to death. The others were injured.
The fire had been far from the road when the bus first set off, but spread about 1,500 metres in less than three minutes."
earthquake,"A magnitude seven earthquake has struck the southern Philippines but there were no immediate reports of damage and a tsunami warning was not issued.
The earthquake hit about 310 kilometres (193 miles) southeast of Davao city on the main southern island of Mindanao at 8:23pm (12:23 GMT), according to the US Geological Survey (USGS).
Residents in the town of Jose Abad Santos, near the southern tip of the island, lost electricity for about 15 minutes after the earthquake shook the region but there was no damage, police chief Captain Glabynarry Murillo told the AFP news agency.
“From our vantage point at the police station, we saw many residents rushing outside,” said Murillo. “We also rushed outside because the police station is a three-storey building.”"
drought,"As parts of Western Turkey battle against recent heavy rain and flooding, the country is facing its most severe drought in a decade.
Istanbul has been warned it has less than 45 days of water left due to poor rainfall in the second half of last year.
""Last year the level of water in dams in Istanbul was twice what it is now, so it wasn't that bad. Now we are in the second year and experiencing rougher droughts,"" Dr Akgün ?lhan, a water management expert, told Euronews.
Ankara's mayor said earlier this month that the capital only had another 110 days’ worth of water left in dams and reservoirs.
Other cities across the country are also struggling with dams and reservoirs below 40 per cent full. Elsewhere farmers in wheat-producing areas fear their crop will fail.
""Since the late 1980s Turkey has faced drought periods,"" says Dr. ?lhan. ""It's every 4-7 years, which is the result of global climate change.""
""However,"" she says, ""what we face now is to a large extent a lack of adaptation or even maladaptation to climate change.""
Whilst it's true that the country receives less precipitation, it also ""makes inefficient use of the water falling on our cities."""
other,"New Zealand volcano eruption: Up to 13 feared dead, authorities say In addition to the dead and missing, 31 survivors have been hospitalized and three others were released, officials said; authorities said 47 people were on the island at the time of the event A volcano off the New Zealand coast erupted Monday with a towering blast of ash and scalding steam as dozens of tourists were exploring the moon-like surface, killing five people and leaving eight others missing and feared dead, authorities said. The missing and injured included New Zealanders and tourists from the U.S., China, Australia, Britain and Malaysia, the prime minister said. ""My god,” Michael Schade tweeted as he posted a video of the eruption. “My family and I had gotten off it 20 minutes before, were waiting at our boat about to leave when we saw it. Boat ride home tending to people our boat rescued was indescribable.”"
earthquake,"The death toll from a powerful earthquake in eastern Turkey reached 22 on Saturday, asrescuers searched for an estimated 22 more people trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings.
The magnitude 6.8 quake shook Elazig province, about 550 km (340 miles) east of the capital Ankara, and was followed by more than 270 aftershocks, 12 of which had magnitudes over 4.
Eighteen people were killed in Elazig and four more in the neighbouring province of Malatya, said Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Authority (AFAD), adding 1,031 others were injured and in hospitals in the region. It said rescue efforts were underway at three different sites in Elazig.
Footage early on Saturday showed emergency workers rescuing three people in Elazig after 12 hours under the rubble. Another woman in Elazig was rescued after 13 hours, while authorities listened for voices, with the government saying 30 more people were still trapped."
wildfires,"A wildfire that forced the evacuation of 2,000 people just west of Madrid may have been started by several people working together, authorities said Tuesday.
Regional justice department chief Regina Planol told Cadena SER radio the fire affecting three towns was started in six points almost simultaneously, indicating it was arson. She compared it to ""environmental terrorism"" and urged residents to help police catch those responsible.
Alvaro Santamaria, the mayor of Valdemaqueda, one of the affected towns, said the fire came as close as 100 metres from the town's homes. He said firefighters were confident the blaze could be brought under control Tuesday.
No one was injured and those evacuated were expected to be able to return later in the day.
Spanish National Television said some 20 square kilometres of land have burned. Spain has seen 1,500 square kilometres of land hit by nearly 12,000 wildfires this year -- more than triple the amount burned last year.
Labour unions say Spanish government austerity cutbacks have led to a lack of resources to help firefighters battle blazes.
In southern Bosnia, military helicopters were sent in to help villagers and firefighters battling devastating wildfires in a region that has seen record high temperatures and no rain for over two months.
Pero Pavlovic, spokesman for the regional Civil Protection Agency, said the most critical situation Tuesday was around Glogosnica, where two blazes were creeping down inaccessible mountain slopes toward the village.
Wildfires were also burning near the Bosnian towns of Trebinje, Gacko, Nevesinje and Mostar."
drought,"The United Nations’ food agency issued an alert on Tuesday warning that a severe drought was threatening the wheat crop in China, the world’s largest wheat producer, and resulting in shortages of drinking water for people and livestock.
China has been essentially self-sufficient in grain for decades, for national security reasons. Any move by China to import large quantities of food in response to the drought could drive international prices even higher than the record levels recently reached.
“China’s grain situation is critical to the rest of the world ? if they are forced to go out on the market to procure adequate supplies for their population, it could send huge shock waves through the world’s grain markets,” said Robert S. Zeigler, the director general of the International Rice Research Institute in Los Ba?os, in the Philippines.
The state-run news media in China warned Monday that the country’s major agricultural regions were facing their worst drought in 60 years. On Tuesday the state news agency Xinhua said that Shandong Province, a cornerstone of Chinese grain production, was bracing for its worst drought in 200 years unless substantial precipitation came by the end of this month.
World wheat prices are already surging, and they have been widely cited as one reason for protests in Egypt and elsewhere in the Arab world. A separate United Nations report last week said global food export prices had reached record levels in January. The impact of China’s drought on global food prices and supplies could create serious problems for less affluent countries that rely on imported food.
With 2.85 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, nearly three times that of Japan, the country with the second-largest reserves, China has ample buying power to prevent any serious food shortages."
wildfires,"The number of fires in the Amazon jumped 20 percent this June compared to June last year, raising concerns that the rainforest could see a repeat of last year's destructive fires.
INPE, Brazil's government space research agency, detected 2,248 fires in June this year, a 13-year high for the month, according to Reuters. Last June, 1,880 fires were detected.
In June 2020, researchers saw an average of 75 fires a day in the Amazon. Last August, during the peak of the massive forest fires that caused global outcry, there were about 1,000 fires detected per day.
While the fires are not yet as bad as last year's, health experts are especially concerned due to the global coronavirus pandemic, Reuters reports. The smoke can cause respiratory problems, which could result in added complications for COVID-19 patients.
""It's a bad sign, but what really is going to count is what happens from now on,"" Philip Fearnside, an ecologist at Brazil's National Institute of Amazonian Research, said, according to Reuters.
Fearnside said rising deforestation is a concern. With deforestation, fires are usually set to clear land when trees are cut down to create pastures.
Preliminary INPE data from the first five months of 2020 shows deforestation is up 34 percent, Reuters says."
earthquake,"A 6.8 magnitude earthquake that also measured a strong 5 on the shindo (intensity) scale struck off Japan’s northeastern coast on Saturday but no tsunami warning was issued, Japanese and U.S. authorities said, with no immediate reports of damage.
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) said the midmorning quake hit at a depth of 47 kilometers (29 miles) in the Pacific, off Ishinomaki, Miyagi prefecture, near the epicenter of the huge March 2011 quake that triggered a towering tsunami, killing more than 18,000 people.
The USGS and Meteorological Agency said there was no tsunami risk following the jolt, which produced strong shaking along parts of the eastern coast and was also felt in Tokyo.
Officials in Aomori, Fukushima and Iwate said no casualties had been reported and public broadcaster NHK said there were no immediate reports of damage.
But a Meteorological Agency official warned strong aftershocks may hit the region in about a week, adding that expected bad weather may trigger landslides following the latest ground shaking.
Two people were slightly injured after windows were broken at a station in Onagawa, Miyagi, NHK said.
“We are aware of the news but still collecting information,” said Kazuto Takeda, an official with the prefecture’s disaster management office.
NHK also said a woman in her 80s was treated in hospital after she fell at a supermarket in Fukushima.
Some sections of expressways and train services, including those on the Tohoku Shinkansen Line, were suspended following the temblor, which was also felt in Tokyo.
Tokyo Electric Power Co. Holdings is checking for any irregularities at its nuclear power plant in Fukushima, according to NHK. Tohoku Electric Power Co. found no abnormalities at its Onagawa, Higashidori nuclear plants, according to a spokesperson.
Saturday marked the first day of a five-day holiday and a number of people were seen evacuating from JR Sendai Station, with university student Asuka Koike, who was on her way to her hometown in Fukushima Prefecture, saying, “I don’t know what to do. I’m afraid as there have been many earthquakes recently.”

Authorities said the fires were propelled partly by the high winds brought by Tropical Storm Lee. A late-summer cool front brought winds of 30 to 40 mph to the region, which is already gripped by one of the worst droughts in history.
The National Weather Service said South, Central and East Texas were all under ""red flag"" warnings for critical fire conditions until late Sunday night.
'We're On Every Fire We Can Possibly Handle'
In the East Texas community of Gladewater, a blaze killed a 20-year-old woman and her toddler daughter who were caught unawares in their mobile home. A longtime Texas sheriff called the Gladewater blaze the fastest-moving fire he has ever seen. Six homes were toppled within minutes, including the mobile home.
""The houses that were in its path on this particular roadway were taken out,"" Gregg County Sheriff Maxey Cerliano said. ""There were many other houses that the fire got right up to the porch.""
Forest Service officials estimated some 1,400 acres were burned in that area alone, destroying homes, barns and vehicles, and thousands of other acres were scorched in other parts of the state.
""We've completely depleted our resources,"" Melanie Spradling, a public information officer with the Texas Forest Service, told the Tyler Morning Telegraph. ""We're on every fire we can possibly handle and then some.""

earthquake,"A strong 7.3-magnitude earthquake struck off Japan's east coast late Saturday, rattling the region hit by the powerful 2011 quake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown just weeks before the disaster's 10th anniversary.
The quake produced powerful shaking along parts of Japan's eastern coast, and was felt strongly in Tokyo, but triggered no tsunami alert.
Kyodo news agency reported at least 30 people injured, but gave no further details.
There were no immediate reports of significant damage, though local news broadcast images of a landslide on a highway.
Japan's meteorological agency said the quake hit at 11:08 pm (1408 GMT) at a depth of 60 kilometres (37 miles) in the Pacific off Fukushima -- near the epicentre of the 2011 killer quake which triggered a towering tsunami and killed more than 18,000 people.
The agency initially reported the strength of the quake as 7.1, but later revised the figure upwards. It said the quake was considered an aftershock of the massive 2011 temblor.
Aftershocks continued to rattle the region in the hours afterwards and officials cautioned local residents to be vigilant. A handful of people were reported to have sought shelter at evacuation centres.
""We are working quickly to collect information but we still have no details to announce. There were some unconfirmed reports about landslides but we are still checking,"" Mikihiro Meguro, an official from the Fukushima prefectural government, told AFP.
Around 950,000 homes lost power throughout the affected region, but no abnormalities were reported at the Fukushima nuclear plant, which melted down in the wake of the 2011 tsunami.
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga was called to his office, and broadcaster NHK said the government would set up a special liaison office to coordinate with affected regions.
""All messed up""
Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato addressed reporters after midnight and said evaluations were under way.
""As far as damage, casualties and structural damage are being assessed,"" he said, adding that sections of the bullet train had been suspended due to power outages.
""Surveys are being done at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant,"" he said.
""We have received reports that Onagawa nuclear plant and Fukushima Daichi nuclear plant are not showing any abnormality,"" he added.
Images posted online showed broken glass at a shop and items spilled off the shelves at a supermarket.
Renowned author Yu Miri, who lives in Fukushima's Minamisoma city, tweeted a photo of her home, showing books, potted plants and other belongings strewn across the floor.
""My house in Odaka, Minamisoma city is all messed up,"" she wrote.
""I hear the ground rumbling. And another quake,"" she tweeted about an aftershock.
Aerial footage broadcast by NHK showed a hillside that collapsed onto a highway in Fukushima region, severing the road. It was not immediately clear if anyone was hurt.

Typhoon,"A powerful typhoon has struck South Korea, killing at least eight people, including five fishermen. Strong winds and heavy rain churned up rough seas and smashed two fishing ships on to rocks, forcing the coastguard to perform a daring rescue of the survivors.
Twelve fishermen were saved and rescuers were still searching for 10 missing from the Chinese ships, which hit rocks off South Korea's southern Jeju island.
At least three other people died as Typhoon Bolaven knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of South Koreans, cancelled flights and temporarily halted joint war games by US and South Korean military forces.
State media in North Korea, which is still struggling to rebuild from recent floods and a devastating drought, reported on Tuesday that the country was being lashed by heavy rain and strong winds.
Off Jeju island, dangerous waves prevented rescue boats from approaching the Chinese fishing ships. The coastguard used a special gun to shoot rope to one ship so officers could pull themselves over and bring the fishermen back to shore, coastguard spokesman Ko Chang-keon said.
Of the 18 fishermen who survived, six swam or were washed ashore."
drought,"The severe drought that struck California from 2011 to 2015 had an obvious impact on rivers, forests, and wildlife. Now, a new study shows it also had some surprising effects on the state’s notorious air pollution, adding new wrinkles to the state’s efforts to clear the skies.
Researchers have long known that plants can both help create and cleanse one dangerous air pollutant: ground-level ozone, which causes breathing problems and exacerbates lung damage. Plants can scrub ozone from the air by absorbing the pollutant through their stomata, or pores. But certain plants also emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that react with other atmospheric chemicals to create ozone.
Understanding how drought influences these two processes can be tricky. Dry conditions could cause ozone levels to rise, because plants shrink their stomata to prevent water loss, reducing their ability to remove pollution. But drought might also reduce ozone levels, because the stress could cause plants to produce fewer ozone-forming VOCs.
California’s lengthy drought, and the state’s extensive network of air pollution sensors, gave researchers a rare opportunity to see what happens in the real world. The team, led by atmospheric chemistry Ph.D. candidate Angelique Demetillo and environmental science professor Sally Pusede at the University of Virginia (UVA) in Charlottesville, examined more than a decade’s worth of satellite and sensor data that documented atmospheric conditions over Bakersfield and Fresno, two California cities that suffer from ozone pollution.
The drought’s impact on air quality changed over time, the researchers report this week in Environmental Science & Technology. Plants did remove less ozone, with absorption dropping by about 15% during the most severe years of the drought. But during the early years of the drought, trees and other plants were able to maintain their production of one key ozone-forming VOC, isoprene. The chemical helps plants like oak trees withstand heat stress, and it appears the trees draw on carbon stores to sustain isoprene production. “It’s like a person exercising; when you’ve burned through your recent consumption the body switches over and starts burning fat,” says Manuel Lerdau, an organismal ecologist at UVA and a co-author of the study.
After about 4 years of drought, however, the stress took its toll. In 2013, plant isoprene levels fell dramatically, by 65% in Bakersfield and 54% in Fresno. Overall, that meant up to a 20% dip in ozone pollution. And even after the drought ended, isoprene levels didn’t immediately rebound.
The plant VOC reduction might sound like good news for reducing California’s smog. But the complexity of atmospheric chemistry means droughts could actually complicate clean air efforts. That’s because, currently, regulations mostly focus on controlling nitrogen oxides (NOx) from sources like cars and factories, which react with VOCs to form ozone. When VOC levels are higher, those NOx controls help choke off smog-creating reactions. But reduce the VOCs, and NOx limits go from “being very effective to less effective,” Pusede says.
Such findings offer yet another complication for U.S. states and cities struggling to meet federal clean air standards, especially in drought-prone western states. Regulators have little ability to control VOC emissions from plants, notes Pusede, and “I don’t know if we’d want to even if we could.” But the study could help regulators do a better job of factoring drought into their air pollution models.
The work also “provides a road map for better quantifying these impacts in other places,” says atmospheric scientist Jessica Neu of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, who reviewed the paper. And because much of the needed data can now be collected by satellites, she says it opens the door to investigating “drought impacts on air quality globally.”"
earthquake,"An estimated magnitude 4.2 earthquake was recorded Friday in a rural area along Oklahoma's border with Kansas, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
The earthquake was recorded at 7:56 a.m. near Manchester, a town of about 100 residents about 100 miles (161 kilometers) north of Oklahoma City, the USGS reported.
Grant County Commissioner Max Hess, whose district includes Manchester, said no injuries or damage were reported.
The rural area in northern Oklahoma is about 55 miles (89 kilometers) northwest of where a recent series of earthquakes were recorded. Geologists say those quakes were likely connected to the underground injection of wastewater that is produced by oil and gas companies.
In response to the quakes, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission ordered oil and gas operators to stop disposal of wastewater within 3 miles (5 kilometers) of the earthquake epicenters and to reduce disposal volumes within 3 to 10 miles (5 to 16 kilometers) of the epicenters."
other,"The Covid-19 vaccination programme in the Republic of Ireland is to be extended to include 12 to 15 year-olds.
The recommendation was made to the Irish government by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC).
Earlier, Taoiseach (Irish PM) Micheál Martin said there would be further advice from the NIAC on the matter.
He said it represented a ""significant opening up"" of the vaccination programme to younger people.
Mr Martin said it had been a ""very effective"" programme to date and the government wanted to encourage ""heightened participation"" among the remaining age groups.
It is understood that it will take a number of days for the Health Service Executive (HSE) to get the system for vaccinating those from 12 to 15 up and running, as it will require parental consent and parents or guardians will have to be present for the jabs."
drought,"Born into a farming family in south Yunnan province, China, Zhu Youyong's life has always been tied to the soil. At the age of 54, however, Zhu — now president of Yunnan Agricultural University in Kunming — says he ""has never seen such severe drought in Yunnan"".
Since last September, the province has had 60% less rainfall than normal. According to the Ministry of Civil Affairs, 8.1 million people — 18% of Yunnan's population — are short of drinking water, and US2.5-billion worth of crops are expected to fail.
Scientists in China say that the crisis marks one of the strongest case studies so far of how climate change and poor environmental practice can combine to create a disaster. They are now scrambling to pin down exactly what caused the drought, and whether similar events are likely to hit the region more often in the future.
Meanwhile, with most of the province's winter crops ruined, local farmers need immediate help. Zhu has been going from county to county to persuade farmers to grow different crops together in the same field, rather than as a monoculture. Intercropping can boost yields by up to 30%, and could help to avoid food shortages in the region later this year1. This summer, 80% of the farmland in Yunnan — a staggering 2.9 million hectares — will use the technique. But success will depend on a break in the weather. ""If it still doesn't rain in late May, the consequences will be unthinkable,"" says Zhu."
Typhoon,"Tropical Storm Bertha hits South Carolina coast Tropical Storm Bertha formed Wednesday morning off the coast of South Carolina. Bertha is becoming the second named storm before the official start of this year’s Atlantic hurricane season. Tropical Storm Bertha made landfall on South Carolina’s coast Wednesday morning shortly after it formed, becoming the second named storm before the official start of this year’s Atlantic hurricane season. A tropical storm warning was issued for South Carolina’s coast and the storm was expected to bring heavy rainfall, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. Bertha’s maximum sustained winds were near 50 mph (80 kph) as it came ashore but it was expected to weaken to a tropical depression after moving inland. The storm was centered about 20 miles (40 kilometers) east of Charleston, South Carolina, and was moving northwest near 9 mph (15 kph). Along America Street in Charleston, residents awoke Wednesday to an intersection that had become a water-filled canal. Cars parked on the curb had water up to their doors, The Post and Courier reported. Garbage cans had spilled over, and dirty diapers, magazines and food scraps clogged drains in the area, the newspaper reported."

At least nine people died and dozens were injured when two magnitude 5.9 earthquakes struck near the border region with Iran, Turkish authorities said. Tremors were felt in eastern Turkey. “A total of 245 houses and 297 barns were destroyed and 694 buildings were damaged in Van,” Murat Kurum told Anadolu Agency’s Editor’s Desk on Monday. He said the border villages were the worst hit as the locals live in unsteady mud houses. “While we carry out damage assessment in the region, our priority is to rebuild permanent residences for our citizens who lost their houses,” he said. Stressing 66% of Turkey’s land and 71% of its population is located on quake zones, he said there was a need to design cities and infrastructure keeping this in mind. He recalled that more than half of the quakes which hit the country were above magnitude 6. In 1999, Turkey's Marmara region was jolted by two massive quakes that claimed lives of tens of thousands. He said the government has spent 170 billion Turkish liras ($27.6 billion) on an urban transformation project. A total of 230 billion Turkish liras ($37.3 billion) have been earmarked for the project that has so far built 1,350,000 houses. A million more houses will be built."
earthquake,"Magnitude 7.8 earthquake strikes off coast of Alaska (CNN)An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 struck off southern Alaska's coast late Tuesday, shaking the Alaska Peninsula and briefly sparking tsunami concerns before officials said no destructive waves were coming. The earthquake was centered in the Pacific Ocean about 60 miles southeast of Perryville on the sparsely populated Alaska Peninsula, striking around 10:12 p.m. local time (2:12 a.m. Wednesday ET). The Alaska Peninsula protrudes from mainland Alaska and is flanked to the southwest by the Aleutian Islands. Reports of significant damage, if any, weren't immediately available. A tsunami warning initially was issued for south Alaska and the Alaska Peninsula, but was canceled by early Wednesday, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The warning sent people to higher ground in cities like Sand Point, an island community of about 1,000 people off the peninsula, the Anchorage Daily News reported. People in Sand Point gathered at a high school until shortly after midnight, when officials gave an all-clear, Jordan Keeler, an Anchorage-based city administrator, told the newspaper."
wildfires,"The fire began in the early hours of Saturday and has been fuelled by gale force winds.
Authorities said that by Monday the blaze had destroyed about 7,000 hectares (16,000 acres) of forest and farmland.
Residents of nine villages and hamlets were evacuated from their homes over the weekend as the fire approached.
Chios lies north-east of the capital, Athens, off the coast of Turkey.
The island is famous for its production of mastic, a natural, gum-like resin with a distinctive flavour produced only by trees on certain sections of the island.
Used as a natural chewing gum, a cooking spice and for pharmaceutical and cooking purposes, mastic resin is a major source of income for the islanders.
The strong winds were hampering efforts to extinguish the fires, despite the presence of several hundred firefighters, soldiers and volunteers, as well as firefighting planes and helicopters.
Wildfires are common during Greece's long, hot summers, though some are believed to be started on purpose.

earthquake,"Tsunami warnings as third strong earthquake strikes off New Zealand WELLINGTON (REUTERS) _ Evacuation orders were issued for New Zealanders living in some areas on the east coast on the North Island after a third earthquake struck in the area on Friday (March 5). The latest was a magnitude 8.0 quake that struck the Kermadec Islands, north-east of New Zealand’s North Island. This came shortly after a 7.4 magnitude earthquake in the same region. Earlier, another large 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck about 900km away on the east of the North Island and was felt by tens of thousands, causing its own tsunami warning. This warning was later lifted. New Zealand’s National Emergency Management Agency (Nema) issued a tsunami warning saying areas under threat were from the Bay of Islands to Whangarei, from Matata to Tolaga Bay including Whakatane and Opotiki, and the Great Barrier Island. “People near the coast in the following areas must move immediately to the nearest high ground, out of all tsunami evacuation zones, or as far inland as possible.

Texas state officials are planning now how to evacuate several endangered species at risk because of the record drought. The state is home to 86 threatened species.
Parched skies and relentless 100 degree heat are turning this summer into one of the worst in history here. Joggers run in the early morning before the heat intensifies; people working in downtown Houston seek shelter in the city's underground tunnel system rather than venturing out on the scorched city sidewalks. Football players practice in the morning to beat the heat, and children spend recess in air conditioned gyms at school.
The heat has driven wildlife into the open -- one homeowner southwest of Houston, who was wondering what was happening to his disappearing watermelon crop, set up a camera, and snapped a photo of a coyote in his backyard, stealing a watermelon.

earthquake,"An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.1 centered under the Talkeetna Mountains in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough shook Southcentral Alaska on Sunday evening.
The quake hit just before 11 p.m. and was centered about 60 miles east of Talkeetna and around 100 miles northeast of Anchorage, according to the Alaska Earthquake Center. It was centered at a depth of about 27 miles. the center reported.
The USGS initially reported the preliminary magnitude as 6.0 and later adjusted the magnitude to 6.1 after review.
The earthquake was felt from Homer to Fairbanks, and was especially strong in the Mat-Su and Anchorage areas. ADN readers on Facebook described items falling off shelves, and many described an extended rolling motion with a sharp jolt midway.
“Talkeetna ... long rumble followed by a very strong jolt that flexed the house and sent some stuff on shelves to the floor,” wrote Mark Westman of Talkeetna. “Then more rumbling. It was a long one. No damage, but the big jolt in the middle definitely rattled the nerves, that one packed a punch.” He later added in a message, “It was notable for the duration as well as the big jolt in the middle.”"
Typhoon,"Bertha _ Atlantic Ocean May 28, 2020 _ NASA Looks at Inland Rainfall from Post Tropical Cyclone Bertha NASA’s GPM core satellite analyzed rainfall generated from post-tropical cyclone Bertha as it continues to move toward the Great Lakes. Bertha formed into a tropical storm on May 27, about 30 miles off the South Carolina coast. By 9:30 a.m. EDT, Bertha made landfall along the coast of South Carolina, east of Charleston. Data from NOAA and CORMP buoys showed that maximum sustained winds increased to near 50 mph (80 kph) before landfall. By 2 p.m. EDT, Bertha weakened to a tropical depression and heavy rainfall spread across the Carolinas. By 11 p.m. EDT, heavy rainfall spread across western North Carolina and southwest Virginia into West Virginia. At that time, the center of Bertha was located about 95 miles (150 km) south-southwest of Roanoke, Virginia. By May 28, Bertha had become a post-tropical cyclone. A Post-Tropical Storm is a generic term for a former tropical cyclone that no longer possesses sufficient tropical characteristics to be considered a tropical cyclone. Former tropical cyclones that have become fully extratropical, subtropical, or remnant lows, are three classes of post-tropical cyclones. In any case, they no longer possess sufficient tropical characteristics to be considered a tropical cyclone. However, post-tropical cyclones can continue carrying heavy rains and high winds."

“Major Hurricane Lane could bring significant impacts to the Hawaiian Islands late week and into the weekend,” officials said. “All residents in [Hawaii] are urged to stay abreast of the situation.”
Officials said it was too early to report which of the main Hawaiian islands would be directly impacted _ though they noted if the hurricane’s centre remained offshore its impacts could still extend well away from the centre. Intense showers and thunderstorms surrounding the hurricane are expected to reach the Big Island late on Tuesday night or Wednesday morning.
Senior Honolulu forecaster Tom Birchard said it’s possible island Oahu and Kaui could be included in a watch.
Officials have also issued tropical storm watches and flash flood watches for islands Kahoolawe, Kauai, Lanai, Maui, Molokai, Niihau, Oahu and the Big Island.
“As Hurricane Lane approaches the islands from the south, deep tropical moisture associated with Lane will spread across the island chain from the east, with increased potential for heavy rainfall,” officials said."
drought,"A megadrought worse than any in “known prehistory” may already be underway in the western United States and northern Mexico, researchers have suggested.
After experiencing a wetter-than-average 20th century, the region has been suffering an ever-lengthening string of dry years starting in 2000, and scientists have now warned the worsening climate crisis is partly responsible for pushing the region towards extreme long-term drought.
The study is based on modern weather observations, along with 1,200 years of tree-ring data and dozens of climate models.
“Earlier studies were largely model projections of the future,” said lead author Park Williams, a bioclimatologist at Columbia University‘s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.
“We’re no longer looking at projections, but at where we are now. We now have enough observations of current drought and tree-ring records of past drought to say that we’re on the same trajectory as the worst prehistoric droughts.”
Reliable modern observations date only to about 1900, but tree rings have allowed scientists to infer yearly soil moisture for centuries before humans began influencing the climate.
The study has rung alarm bells, as previous research has linked the catastrophic ancient droughts recorded in tree rings to concurrent upheavals among indigenous medieval-era civilisations in the southwest US.
The new study is the most up-to-date and comprehensive long-term analysis, the researchers have said. It covers an area stretching across nine US states from Oregon and Montana down through California and New Mexico, and part of northern Mexico.
Using rings from thousands of trees, the researchers charted dozens of droughts across the region, starting in 800 AD.
Four stand out as so-called megadroughts, with extreme aridity lasting decades: the late 800s, mid-1100s, the 1200s, and the late 1500s. After 1600, there were other droughts, but none on such a large scale.
The team then compared the ancient megadroughts to soil moisture records calculated from observed weather in the years from 2000 to 2018.
They found the current drought is already outdoing the three earliest ones. The fourth, which spanned 1575 to 1603, may have been the worst of all — but the difference is slight enough to be within the range of uncertainty.
Furthermore, the current drought is affecting wider areas more consistently than any of the earlier ones — this is the “fingerprint” of climate change and associated temperatures, the researchers said.
All of the ancient droughts lasted longer than 19 years — the one that started in the 1200s ran for nearly a century — but all began by following a similar path to what is happening now, they said.
The ancient droughts weren’t driven by manmade climate change, and nature is still playing a strong role today.
A study last year led by Nathan Steiger at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University showed among other things, that unusually cool periodic conditions over the tropical Pacific Ocean (commonly called La Ni?a) during the previous megadroughts pushed storm tracks further north, and starved the region of precipitation."

Tropical Storm Arthur crawled closer to the North Carolina coast early Monday, amid threats of some minor flooding and rough seas as the system moves off the Southeast seaboard. Arthur formed Saturday in waters off Florida, marking the sixth straight year that a named storm has developed before the official June 1 start of the Atlantic hurricane season. The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami issued a tropical storm warning for North Carolina’s Outer Banks on Sunday. At 2 a.m. EDT, the storm’s center was located about 185 miles (300 kilometers) south-southwest of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Arthur had top sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kph) and was moving to the north-northeast at 12 mph (19 kph). The hurricane center said Arthur is expected to move near or just east of the coast of North Carolina, where 1-3 inches of rain is expected, on Monday and they turn away from the East Coast on Monday night and Tuesday. By Sunday night, the storm’s swirling outer rain bands were skirting closer to the coast. A tropical storm warning was issued for parts of North Carolina’s coast, from Surf City to Duck, including Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds. Michael Lee, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Newport, North Carolina, said tropical-storm-force winds are possible along the coast, particularly in the Outer Banks. “Otherwise, it’s going to be some heavy rainfall for a large part of eastern North Carolina,” Lee said. “But the main threat that we’re really trying to get out there is that there is enhanced risk for dangerous rip currents both today and tomorrow. So, any folks who want to try to go to the beach and get in the water, we have a high risk out for most of our beaches.” The weather service said eastern North Carolina should prepare for some localized flooding and dangerous marine conditions along the coast. “Minor inundation from storm surge is possible for very low-lying areas adjacent to the ocean, sounds, and rivers, with overwash of dunes and flooding of properties and roadways possible for locations where dune structures are weak,” mainly north of Cape Lookout, the weather service said."
other,"A Covid outbreak first discovered in the Chinese city of Nanjing has spread to five provinces and Beijing, with state media calling it the most extensive contagion after Wuhan.
Almost 200 people have been infected since the virus was first detected at the city's busy airport on 20 July.
All flights from Nanjing airport will be suspended until 11 August, according to local media.
Officials also began city-wide testing amid criticism for their ""failure"".
All 9.3 million of the city's residents - including those visiting - will be tested, said state-controlled Xinhua news.
Posts on social media show long lines of people queuing, and authorities have reportedly urged people to wear masks, stand one metre apart and avoid talking while they wait.
Officials said the highly contagious Delta variant of the virus was behind the infections, adding that cases had spread further because of how busy the airport is.
Ding Jie, a health official in Nanjing, told reporters the cases were linked to cleaners who worked on a flight from Russia that arrived in the city on 10 July.
The cleaners did not follow strict hygiene measures, Xinhua News reported.
The airport management has been rebuked, with a senior disciplinary body of the Communist Party saying it had ""problems such as lack of supervision and unprofessional management"".
Testing has shown that the virus has now spread to at least 13 cities including Chengdu and the capital Beijing.
However, experts quoted by the Global Times said they believed the outbreak was still at an early stage and could be controlled.
Local officials in Nanjing said that seven of those infected were in critical condition.
The new spike in cases has led some on Chinese social media to speculate about whether the Chinese vaccines were working against the Delta variant.
It is unclear if those infected were vaccinated.
A number of South East Asian countries relying on Chinese vaccines have recently announced they will use other jabs.
China has so far managed to keep the virus largely under control by closing borders and moving quickly to stamp out local outbreaks."
earthquake,"Japan's most powerful earthquake since records began has struck the north-east coast, triggering a massive tsunami.
Cars, ships and buildings were swept away by a wall of water after the 8.9-magnitude tremor, which struck about 400km (250 miles) north-east of Tokyo.
A state of emergency has been declared at a nuclear power plant, where pressure has exceeded normal levels.
Officials say 350 people are dead and about 500 missing, but it is feared the final death toll will be much higher.
In one ward alone in Sendai, a port city in Miyagi prefecture, 200 to 300 bodies were found.
The quake was the fifth-largest in the world since 1900 and nearly 8,000 times stronger than the one which devastated Christchurch, New Zealand, last month, said scientists.
Thousands of people living near the Fukushima nuclear power plant have been ordered to evacuate.
Japanese nuclear officials said pressure inside a boiling water reactor at the plant was running much higher than normal after the cooling system failed.
Officials said they might need to deliberately release some radioactive steam to relieve pressure, but that there would be no health risk.
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had earlier said the US Air Force had flown emergency coolant to the site.
But US officials later said no coolant had been handed over because the Japanese had decided to handle the situation themselves.
The UN's nuclear agency said four nuclear power plants had shut down safely.
Measured at 8.9 by the US Geological Survey, it struck at 1446 local time (0546 GMT) at a depth of about 24km.
The tsunami rolled across the Pacific at 800km/h (500mph) - as fast as a jetliner - before hitting Hawaii and the US West Coast, but there were no reports of major damage from those regions.
Thousands of people were ordered to evacuate coastal areas in the states of California, Oregon and Washington.
The biggest waves of more than 6-7ft (about 2m) were recorded near California's Crescent City, said the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre.
A tsunami warning extended across the Pacific to North and South America, where many other coastal regions were evacuated, but the alert was later lifted in most parts, including the Philippines, Australia and China.
Strong waves hit Japan's Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures, damaging dozens of coastal communities.
A 10m wave struck Sendai, deluging farmland and sweeping cars across the airport's runway. Fires broke out in the centre of the city."
earthquake,"6.4 quake strikes Argentina's San Juan province, no tsunami warning issued (CNN)A magnitude 6.4 earthquake has struck Argentina's west-central province of San Juan on Monday night, according to a preliminary report from the United States Geological Survey. A series of aftershocks around the country followed. A magnitude 5.0 aftershock struck 27 kilometers (about 16.8 miles) south-southwest of Nueve de Julio, around 1,000 km (620 miles) east of the first quake and almost 20 minutes later. Then, a magnitude 4.9 quake came in the same area as the first, followed by a magnitude 5.3 aftershock. The 4.9, 5.0 and 5.3-magnitude quakes are considered aftershocks as they are smaller in magnitude than the main quake and in the same area. No injuries have been reported so far, according to San Juan Governor Sergio U_ac. Based on available data, there is no tsunami threat at this time, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC). Speaking at a press conference early Tuesday, U_ac said local authorities are still analyzing the damage, which impacted streets and highways in the province. Some locations experienced power cuts, and homes experienced damage in the town of Caucete. Four people had to be evacuated from their homes in the town of Zonda, in San Juan. The governor added that the electricity service is now gradually being reestablished. No public buildings have been damaged; some hospitals reported broken glass, but experienced no major structural damage. U_ac urged people to stay calm after the quakes hit. ""Let's put into practice all the measures that we have learned to prevent incidents, while we are committed to knowing the impact of the (earthquake) to collaborate in everything necessary,"" he tweeted. He added that the province was working with civil and security forces to respond, as well as with municipalities to respond to ""take care of them."""
Typhoon,"Tropical Storm Arthur hits North Carolina coast with rain Tropical Storm Arthur moved out to sea Monday after dumping heavy rain on North Carolina as forecasters warned that the first named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season could continue to whip dangerous surf and rip currents for another day or more along the U.S. East Coast. The storm represented another early start for the Atlantic hurricane season. Arthur formed Saturday in waters off Florida, marking the sixth straight year that a named storm has developed before June 1. By late Monday, storm watches and warnings that had been in effect for parts of the North Carolina coast were canceled. As Arthur’s center passed off North Carolina earlier in the day, a pocket along the coast that includes Newport and Havelock recorded more than 4 inches (10 cm) of rain, according to the National Weather Service. Other areas along the coast saw 2 inches (5 cm) or more, causing some secondary roads to flood. Wind gusts of 40 mph or more (64 kph) were recorded in at least two places on the Outer Banks, the weather service said. The Hurricane Center said Arthur was moving northeast at 16 mph (26 kph) Monday afternoon as its center pulled away from the U.S. mainland. At 5 p.m. EDT, the storm’s center was located about 110 miles (175 kilometers) northeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Arthur had top sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph). Forecasters said Arthur could strengthen some as it moves away from land, but was likely to lose its tropical storm characteristics later Monday or Tuesday. North Carolina Emergency Management Director Mike Sprayberry said that over-wash or standing water had closed a highway on the Outer Banks and another on the mainland. Other secondary roads had flooded. Otherwise, he said conditions were stable and that no other serious problems had been reported to the state. Still, he warned that surf conditions will remain dangerous and advised people to be cautious around the water even as the storm pushes out to sea. “People in the eastern part of our state should remain cautious, especially while driving in areas where water may collect on roads,” he said at a news conference. “Today is not the day to take risks at the beach or in the surf.” Forecasters said rough surf could continue for another day or two. While other pre-June storms may be influenced by warming waters and climate change, Arthur is more of a subtropical system than a traditional named storm, said Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach, who added that its water is cooler than what’s usually needed for storm formation. A lot of these out-of-season storms are weak ones that meteorologists can detect because of satellites and other technology, but comparable storms would have been missed in an earlier era, Klotzbach said."
wildfires,"Fires in Brazil’s Amazon increased 13% in the first nine months of the year compared with a year ago, as the rainforest region experiences its worst rash of blazes in a decade, data from space research agency Inpe has shown.
Satellites in September recorded 32,017 hotspots in the world’s largest rainforest, a 61% rise from the same month in 2019.
In August last year, surging fires in the Amazon captured global headlines and prompted criticism from world leaders such as France’s Emmanuel Macron that Brazil was not doing enough to protect the rainforest.
On Tuesday, the US Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, called for a world effort to offer $20bn to end Amazon deforestation and threatened Brazil with unspecified “economic consequences” if it did not “stop tearing down the forest”.
President Jair Bolsonaro lambasted Biden’s comment as a “cowardly threat” to Brazil’s sovereignty and a “clear sign of contempt”.
Data from Inpe released on Thursday showed that in 2019, fires spiked in August and declined considerably the month after, but this year’s peak has been more sustained. Both August and September of 2020 have matched or surpassed last year’s single-month high.
“We have had two months with a lot of fire. It’s already worse than last year,” said Ane Alencar, science director for Brazil’s Amazon Environmental Research Institute (Ipam).
“It could get worse if the drought continues. We are at the mercy of the rain.”
The Amazon is experiencing a more severe dry season than last year, which scientists attribute in part to warming in the tropical North Atlantic Ocean pulling moisture away from South America.
The entire Amazon, which spans nine countries, currently has 28,892 active fires, according to a fire monitoring tool funded in part by the US space agency, Nasa.
The fires in September are not only burning recently deforested areas and farmland, where ranchers set them to clear land, but are also increasingly burning virgin forest, a worrying trend that suggests the rainforest is becoming drier and more prone to fire.
Roughly 62% of major Amazon fires were in forests in September, compared with only 15% in August, according to an analysis of satellite images by the US-based non-profit Amazon Conservation.
The warming of the North Atlantic is also helping drive drought in the Brazilian Pantanal, the world’s largest wetland, which has suffered more fires this year than ever previously recorded, according to Inpe data.
A Federal University of Rio de Janeiro analysis found that 23% of the wetlands, which are home to the densest population of jaguars in the world, has burned.
“Brazil is on fire,” said Cristiane Mazzetti, a forest campaigner for advocacy group Greenpeace Brasil, in a statement."
Typhoon,"Tropical Storm Bertha makes landfall on South Carolina coast, could bring up to 8 inches of rain to some areas Bertha is the second named storm of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season. The main impact from Bertha will be heavy rain in the Carolinas and Virginia. Bertha is the same system that drenched Florida over the Memorial Day weekend. Tropical Storm Bertha made landfall on South Carolina’s coast Wednesday morning shortly after it formed, forecasters said. Bertha is the second named storm of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, which doesn't officially begin until June 1. A tropical storm warning was in place for much of the South Carolina coast. The main impact from Bertha will be heavy rain, the National Hurricane Center said, primarily in portions of South and North Carolina and Virginia. Up to 8 inches of rain is possible in some areas, AccuWeather said. ""This rainfall may produce life-threatening flash flooding,"" the hurricane center said. Bertha’s maximum sustained winds were near 50 mph, but it was expected to weaken to a tropical depression after moving inland. Along America Street in Charleston, residents awoke Wednesday to an intersection that had become a water-filled canal. Cars parked on the curb had water up to their doors, The Post and Courier reported. The storm was centered about 20 miles east of Charleston, South Carolina, and was moving northwest near 9 mph. Bertha is the same system that drenched Florida over the Memorial Day weekend, bringing record rainfall to several South Florida communities. Miami recorded 7.43 inches of rain over the holiday weekend. West Palm Beach shattered its daily rainfall record Monday when 4.44 inches poured down. Fort Lauderdale recorded record rainfall May 25: a total of 4.03 inches. Bertha follows on the heels of Tropical Storm Arthur, which brushed the North Carolina coast last week. This is the first time since 2012 that two named storms have formed in the month of May, according to Houston-based meteorologist Matt Lanza."
Typhoon,"Tropical Storm Cristobal bears down on U.S. Gulf Coast Louisiana, Gov. John Bel Edwards has declared a state of emergency to prepare for the storm’s possible arrival. NEW ORLEANS — A re-energized Tropical Storm Cristobal continued its advance toward the U.S. Gulf Coast early Sunday, having spawned a tornado in Florida and brought heavy rains that already caused flooding and mudslides in Mexico and Central America. After weakening to a tropical depression while moving over land in Mexico's Gulf coast, Cristobal headed back into the southern Gulf of Mexico from the Yucatan Peninsula on Friday and powered back up into a tropical storm. Forecasters said it would arrive on U.S. soil late Sunday but was not expected to grow into a hurricane. Outer rain bands from the storm were spreading across parts of the northern Gulf Coast early Sunday, and conditions were expected to deteriorate, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. Cristobal’s maximum sustained winds remained at 50 mph and it was moving north at 12 mph, centered around 175 miles south-southwest from the mouth of the Mississippi River. On Sunday afternoon, the National Hurricane Center's Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch in Miami tweeted that the storm's ""peak seas"" off the coast of Louisiana were 25 feet tall, but that winds and seas would diminish on Monday. However, the National Hurricane Center said the storm was expected to slowly strengthen until making landfall Sunday night along the U.S. Gulf Coast. But the storm already made its presence felt Saturday evening with a tornado that touched down near downtown Orlando, the National Weather Service said. The twister just missed a group of protesters at Lake Eola at around 7:30 p.m. There appeared to be no injuries, but tree limbs were knocked down, and there were reports of power outages."
Typhoon,"An island south of Tokyo, Izu Oshima, was worst hit by Typhoon Wipha, suffering landslides and flooding.
Many people died when houses collapsed or were buried in mudslides. At least 50 people remain unaccounted for.
Work to protect the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant was carried out but the operators say it appears to have escaped the worst of the storm.
In Tokyo, flights were cancelled, bullet train services suspended and schools closed.
""It is the strongest typhoon in 10 years to pass the Kanto [Tokyo area] region,"" Hiroyuki Uchida, the Japan Meteorological Agency's chief forecaster, told journalists on Tuesday.
Typhoon Wipha has now been downgraded to a tropical storm as it moves north-east.
The storm brought strong winds and record rainfall on Wednesday morning.
Nearly 5 inches (12cm) of rainfall fell in just one hour on Izu Oshima island, some 120km (75 miles) south of Tokyo.
The storm sent large volumes of earth down mountainsides and caused rivers to burst their banks.
Television footage showed the remains of wooden homes buried in mud and covered in debris.
""I heard a crackling sound and then the trees on the hillside all fell over,"" a woman on the island told national broadcaster NHK television. ""Then mud slid as far as the house.""
Japanese media said the death toll had risen to 16 but 51 people remained unaccounted for on Izu Oshima.
Rescuers were struggling to access many areas, local reports said.
""City hall and fire officials are doing rescue work in places that are accessible,"" a local official told AFP news agency.
Extra police officers and soldiers as well as helicopters have been sent to the island - a popular tourist destination with more than 8,000 residents - to help with the rescue effort.
In Tokyo, a woman died after falling in a river and a search was under way for two young boys last seen on a beach, reports said.
About 400 domestic and international flights were also cancelled in the capital, Kyodo news agency said.
Nearly 20,000 people were ordered to leave and thousands of schools shut as a result of the typhoon, Reuters news agency reported.
Around midday (03:00 GMT), the typhoon passed close to Fukushima, where contaminated water used to cool reactor cores is being stored in temporary tanks.
Plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Company said it had to pump out rain water from around the storage tanks, but added that its radiation readings were within a safe limit.
The storm had caused the plant no new problems, a spokesman said."
Typhoon,"Tropical Storm Bolaven, once a massive typhoon, left at least 16 people dead in South Korea after pummeling the country with heavy wind and rain as it moved along its coast, the authorities said Wednesday.
The storm had weakened as it traveled north over the cooler waters of the Yellow Sea before making landfall in North Korea and China on Tuesday.
Six Chinese fishermen died and nine remained missing after two boats capsized in stormy waters near Jeju Island, off the southern tip of the South Korean mainland, the maritime police said. The search for those still unaccounted for continued Wednesday.
The South Korean Central Disaster Relief Headquarters said that another 10 people had been killed in other accidents caused by the storm and that two people had been injured.
Forecasters predicted Bolaven would move north-northeast through North Korea and decrease in strength over land Wednesday."
Typhoon,"A satellite map shows Typhoon Utor, which is referred to as Labuyo in the Philippines, at 2:32 p.m. local time Monday.
The world's strongest storm of the year so far plowed across the northern Philippines on Monday, killing at least one person and leaving 20 fishermen missing.
Packing winds as strong as 200 kilometers per hour (124 mph), Typhoon Utor made landfall early Monday on the east coast of the Philippine island of Luzon, damaging hundreds of houses.
""It's the strongest typhoon we've had so far on the planet this year,"" said CNN International meteorologist Samantha Mohr. ""So that gives you some idea of the magnitude of this system.""
Utor, known in the Philippines as Labuyo, churned west-northwest over Luzon, dumping heavy rain on the island's hilly terrain and bringing the risk of landslides. It weakened as it moved over land, and by Monday afternoon, it had begun to head out into the South China Sea.
Aid groups in the Philippines, which had been preparing for the storm's arrival for several days, said they were only just beginning to assess the situation on the ground in the hardest-hit areas.
""There's a high risk that part of the population may get isolated because of landslides and difficulty moving around,"" said Anna Lindenfors, country director for Save the Children in the Philippines.
The country's National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council reported one death in the province of Benguet on Monday afternoon.
Twenty fishermen who had headed out to sea before the storm's arrival remained unaccounted for, the agency said. But dozens of others who had initially been reported missing had returned home safely, it said.
The agency reported damage to 673 houses in the province of Aurora, where the storm made landfall.
The typhoon destroyed nearly 80% of the infrastructure in Casiguran, a town that lay in Utor's path across the province, CNN affiliate ABS-CBN reported.
The storm tore apart rickety houses and ripped the roof off a local hospital, the local broadcaster said, showing images of flattened homes buried under fallen trees.
Situated near an area of the Pacific Ocean where typhoons form, the Philippines regularly suffers severe storm damage.
An average of 20 typhoons hit the Southeast Asian country every year, and two or three of those cause serious damage, according to Plan International, an aid and development organization.
Utor is expected to pick up more strength over the warm waters of the South China Sea over the next day or so before making landfall on the southern coast of China on Wednesday."
wildfires,"Many Australians just lost their summer, thanks to the recent bushfire crisis.
These intense fires devastated communities, destroyed wildlife populations and left many feeling bereft and overwhelmed.
To convey a sense of the unprecedented scale of the disaster much of the reporting focused on numbers, but where did these figures come from?
Here, we take a close-up look at five of these numbers: where they come from, and whether they're for real.
The most obvious way to communicate the scale of a fire disaster — and compare it to other fires — is by focusing on the area of land the fire that has burned.
According to the Department of Home Affairs, to date more than 12.6 million hectares across Australia have been burned.
To put that in some perspective, in New South Wales alone more than 5.4 million hectares have been burned, said Ben Shepherd from the NSW Rural Fire Service.
""An average fire season here in New South Wales is typically at around 300,000 hectares,"" Inspector Shepherd said."
earthquake,"Nine dead after earthquake hits Turkey-Iran border A 5.7 magnitude quake has struck Iran's northwestern border with Turkey. Ankara says nine people have been killed in Turkey, while Iran is still assessing damage and casualties. Nine people, including three children, have died following a 5.7 magnitude earthquake that struck the Turkey-Iran border region early on Sunday, Turkey's interior minister Suleyman Soylu said. Twenty-one people were injured — including eight who were in a critical condition, according to the health ministry. ""Search and rescue efforts are ongoing,"" Soylu said, adding that officials think people are still buried under the collapse of more than 1,000 buildings in several border villages. The quake had a depth of 5 kilometers (3.1 miles), the European Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) said."
earthquake,"Hundreds of aftershocks hit British Columbia including a 6.4-magnitude tremor Sunday afternoon,following one of the strongest earthquakes to the area in decades.
The province’s coastline was walloped with a 7.7-magnitude earthquake just after 8 p.m. PT Saturday. The U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake struck at a depth of 17 kilometres centred 139 km south of Masset in the Haida Gwaii region.
Residents inVancouver’s mainland felt the intense quake with smaller tremors reaching the Greater Vancouver Area. Peopleas far as Edmonton, Alberta also reportedly feelingaftershocks well into Sunday. Tremors are expected to continue for days but many will go unnoticed.
The quake prompted a number of tsunami warnings along the province’s coastand as far away as Hawaii and California, but all were called off Sunday.
Still no reports of injuries or significant damages have been reported aside from personal belongings broken and misplaced from the tremors.
Tsunami warnings were issued for a large stretch of the North and Central coast, as well as the Haida Gwaii region. These Tsunami warnings prompted some residents to evacuate their homes. Haida Gwaii and other coastal communities such as Tofino sought out higher ground.
All of the warnings affecting British Columbia’s coastline were called off at about 3:22 a.m. Sunday in a bulletin from the U.S. National Weather Service’s West Coast/Alaska Tsunami Warning Center."
earthquake,"A 6.2-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Indonesia's Sumatra Island Wednesday, the US Geological Survey said, but there was no tsunami warning or immediate reports of damage.
The strong offshore quake hit about 217 kilometres south-southwest of the city of Bengkulu at a shallow depth of 10 kilometres at 7:52 pm local time (1252 GMT).
Shallow quakes tend to cause more damage than deep ones.
The Southeast Asian archipelago experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity due to its position on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", where tectonic plates collide.
More than 100 people were killed when a 6.2-magnitude quake rocked the small city of Mamuju on Sulawesi island last month.
In 2018, a 7.5-magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami on Sulawesi island left more than 4,300 people dead or missing.
A devastating 9.1-magnitude quake struck off the coast of Sumatra in 2004, triggering a tsunami that killed 220,000 throughout the region, including around 170,000 in Indonesia -- one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history."
Typhoon,"Twenty-three people were missing as Typhoon Utor swept across the northern Philippines on Monday, ripping roofs off houses, tearing down power lines and triggering landslides in remote villages.
With wind gusts of 200 kilometres (124 miles) an hour, Utor was the most powerful storm to strike the Philippines this year and authorities were on alert for worst-case scenarios.
""This has the strongest sustained winds for the year,"" government weather forecaster Samuel Duran told AFP.
Hundreds of people die each year in the Philippines from the roughly 20 typhoons that strike the country annually.
There were no immediate reports of casualties from Utor on Monday morning, but the national disaster agency said it was concerned for 23 missing fishermen.
""They went out to sea before we declared that a storm was approaching,"" said National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council spokesman Reynaldo Balido.
""We are still hoping that within the day, they will return home. The practice in those areas is if a storm is approaching, they seek refuge somewhere.""
There were also concerns for remote towns and villages that had been isolated by the storm, with telecommunications networks to the areas out of order and roads cut off by landslides.
After building strength in the Pacific Ocean, Utor hit the northern regions of the main island of Luzon at 3:00 am on Monday (1900 GMT on Sunday).
Television footage from Aurora province, along the east coast of Luzon where Utor made landfall, showed uprooted trees that had fallen on top of houses, while roofs were ripped off some buildings.
The civil defence director for Aurora province, Josefina Timoteo, said reports had been received of more than 600 houses and 12 school buildings being damaged in one town, Dinalungan.
Alex Uy, the civil defence chief in charge of the northern mountain city of Baguio, said power outages were widespread across northern Luzon.
""The wind speed is strong enough to topple power lines. Even in our office, we have no electricity. We have to use a generator,"" Uy told AFP.
As of midday (0400 GMT), the storm was about half way across Luzon, passing over some of the most mountainous and isolated terrain in the country, moving westward towards the South China Sea.
It was expected to move out of the Philippines by late Monday, according to the weather bureau.
In Manila, the nation's capital, roughly 200 kilometres to the south of the storm, there was heavy rain overnight but no major flooding.
With more rain expected, many schools across the capital were closed on Monday.
Over a thousand people were killed when Typhoon Bopha hit the Philippines in December, the most devastating storm in the world for 2012."
other,"Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi has denied a report that it was considering going private to appease Chinese authorities.
Its shares had soared by almost 50% in Thursday's pre-market trade after the Wall Street Journal report.
Since making its US market debut a month ago the company has been targeted by authorities in Beijing.
Meanwhile, some US senators have called on its financial markets regulator to investigate Chinese share listings.
""The rumors about the privatization of Didi are untrue, and the company is currently actively cooperating with cybersecurity reviews,"" the company said on Chinese social media platform Weibo.
The statement came in response to a Wall Street Journal report, which cited people familiar with the matter as saying Didi was considering delisting its share in the US as it faced increasing pressure from regulators in China.
Two days after Didi shares started trading on the New York Stock Exchange, China's internet regulator ordered online stores not to offer its app, saying it illegally collected users' personal data.
That sent the company's market value down sharply and it has now fallen by around a third since Didi raised $4.4bn (£3.15bn) in its initial public offering (IPO) a month ago.
On Thursday, a group of Republican senators called on the country's financial markets regulator to launch an inquiry into US-listed Chinese companies.
In the letter to the head of Securities and Exchanges Commission the seven lawmakers cited losses sustained by Didi investors after Beijing's took action against the company.
In recent months Chinese technology companies traded in the US, Hong Kong and mainland China have seen their share prices slump as Beijing tightens its grip on the industry.
Just this week authorities have cracked down on a range of online services from food delivery apps to music streaming platforms.
Didi shares ended Thursday's US trading day up by 11.3%."
earthquake,"The earthquake unleashed dozens of aftershocks, some six kilometres northeast of the city of Majene,  causing heavy damage across the city, including to the five-story Mitra Manakarra Hospital where eight people were reportedly trapped inside.  
“The Governor’s office, two hotels, a mall, a community health centre, and over 300 houses also sustained damage”, said the spokesperson for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Jens Laerke. 
Local authorities have reported that 638 people have been injured and more than 18,000 have been temporarily displaced to 10 evacuation sites.  
However, these numbers are expected to increase as assessments continue.  
“The earthquake interrupted the access road between?Majene?and the provincial capital?Mamuju?in three different locations”, said Mr. Laerke.  
“Electricity, communications network and fuel supply have also been disrupted”, he added.
The OCHA spokesperson pointed out that the earthquake?followed?a 5.7 magnitude shock that rocked the same area on Thursday afternoon.? 
The chief of Indonesia’s Meteorology and Geophysics agency, Dwikorita Karnawati, warned that strong aftershocks could follow, telling a news conference that there had already been at least 26, after the two quakes had rocked the area, since Thursday afternoon. 
“The structures of the materials and rocks under the earth are unstable or weak after 28 tremors, and these may cause an underwater landslide and trigger a tsunami”, she said, recommending that people stay away from the coast if another strong quake strikes."

Typhoon,"Typhoon ""Yolanda"" (international name Haiyan) has made landfall in Eastern Visayas, threatening areas in its path, state weather bureau PAGASA said.
PAGASA said Yolanda made landfall over Guiuan, Eastern Samar at 4:40 a.m. It made a second landfall over Tolosa, Leyte at 7 a.m.
Yolanda was packing maximum sustained winds of 235 kilometers per hour near the center and gusts of up to 275 kph.
In Tacloban City, Leyte, a city very near the site where the typhoon first made landfall, flood water quickly rose. Video footage showed debris on the road being swept by flood waters.
Visibility was also poor due to the sheer strength of the typhoon's wind.
More areas have been placed under public storm warning signal no. 4, where winds of at least 185 kph may be felt in at least 12 hours.
PAGASA said areas under signal no. 4 are Masbate, Ticao Island, Southern Sorsogon, Romblon, Northern Samar, Eastern Samar, Samar, Leyte, Southern Leyte , Biliran , Northern Cebu, Cebu City, Bantayan, Camotes Island, Northern Negros Occidental, Capiz, Aklan, Antique, Iloilo, and Guimaras.
Under signal no. 3 are Burias Island, Albay, Marinduque, Occidental Mindoro, Oriental Mindoro, Calamian Group of Islands, the rest of Sorsogon, the rest of Negros Occidental, Negros Oriental, the rest of Cebu, Bohol, Surigao del Norte, and Siargao Island.
Catanduanes, Camarines Sur, Southern Quezon, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, Metro Manila, Cavite, Bataan, Lubang Island, Siquijor , Northern Palawan , Puerto Princesa, Camiguin, Surigao Del Sur, and Agusan Del Norte have been placed under signal no. 2.
Meanwhile, under signal no. 1 are Camarines Norte, rest of Quezon , Polilio Island, Bulacan, Pampanga, Zambales, Misamis Oriental, and Agusan del Sur.
 
Forecast track of Typhoon ""Yolanda"" as of 2 a.m., 08 November 2013. Image from PAGASA
PAGASA said Yolanda is forecast to move west northwest at 39 kph. After hitting Guiuan, it is expected to traverse the provinces of Biliran, the northern tip of Cebu, Iloilo, Capiz, Aklan, Romblon, Semirara Island, southern part of Mindoro and then Busuanga.
Yolanda is expected to exit Philippine landmass on Saturday morning, moving towards the West Philippine Sea.
An estimated rainfall amount of 10 to 30 millimeters per hour (heavy - intense) is expected within the typhoon's 400-km diameter.
Sea travel is risky over the seaboards of Northern Luzon and the eastern seaboard of Central Luzon.
Residents in low lying and mountainous areas under signal nos. 4, 3 and 2 are alerted against possible flash floods and landslides. Likewise, those living in coastal areas under signal nos. 4, 3 and 2 are alerted against storm surges which may produce waves with height of at least 7 meters.
Storm surge warning
The Department of Science and Technology's Project NOAH (Nationwide Operational Assessment of Hazards) said areas in the path of the typhoon could experience tidal and storm-induced waves that could reach as high as 17 feet.
Project NOAH said Ormoc, Leyte could experience waves as high as 5.2 meters (17 feet), with its peak occurring at 2 p.m. today.
Other areas that will see seawater rise above more than 4 meters (13 feet) because of typhoon Yolanda include Matarinao Bay, Eastern Samar (4.7 meters); Port Pusgo, Quezon (4.6 meters); Santa Cruz Harbor, Quezon (4.3 meters); Poro Island, Biliran (4.3 meters); Banate, Iloilo (4.1 meters); and Port Barton, Palawan (4 meters).
An estimated 17 million people are forecast to be affected by cyclone-strength winds brought by the typhoon.
The Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System (GDACS), a cooperation framework between the United Nations, the European Commission and disaster managers worldwide to improve alerts, said 14.2 million people may be affected by Category 1 (120 kilometers per hour) wind speeds.
In an advisory issued at 5 a.m. on Friday (Manila time), GDACS said Yolanda was already packing 315 kph maximum sustained winds.
Massive evacuation
President Benigno Aquino had on Thursday warned his countrymen to make all possible preparations for Haiyan, which was packing monster wind gusts of nearly 380 kilometers (235 miles) an hour as it approached the Philippines.
""To our local officials, your constituents are facing a serious peril. Let us do all we can while (Haiyan) has not yet hit land,"" Aquino said in a nationally televised address.
""We can minimize the effects of this typhoon if we help each other. Let us remain calm, especially in buying our primary needs, and in moving to safer places.""
Aquino warned areas within the expected 600-kilometer typhoon front would be exposed to severe flooding as well as devastating winds, while coastal areas may see waves six meters (20 feet) high.
More than 125,000 people in the most vulnerable areas had been moved to evacuation centers before Haiyan hit, according to the civil defense office, and millions of others braced for the typhoon in their homes.
Authorities said schools in the storm's path were closed, ferry services suspended and fishermen ordered to secure their vessels.
In the capital of Manila, which was not directly in the typhoon's path but still expected to feel some of its impact, many schools were also closed.
Philippine Airlines, Cebu Pacific and other carriers announced the suspension of hundreds of flights, mostly domestic but also some international.
Cajulis said Haiyan was travelling quickly, at 39 kilometers an hour, and would travel across the country towards the South China Sea throughout Friday.
There were no immediate reports of casualties.
State weather forecaster Glaize Escullar said on Thursday Haiyan was expected to hit areas still recovering from a devastating storm in 2011 and from a 7.1-magnitude quake last month.
They include the central island of Bohol, the epicenter of the earthquake that killed 222 people, where at least 5,000 survivors are still living in tents while waiting for new homes.
Other vulnerable areas are the port cities of Cagayan de Oro and Iligan on the southern island of Mindanao, where flash floods induced by Tropical Storm Washi killed more than 1,000 people in December 2011.
Haiyan had maximum sustained winds on Friday morning of 315 kilometers an hour, and gusts of 379 kilometers an hour, according to the US Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Center.
The Philippine state weather service, which typically gives lower wind readings, said the maximum gusts on Friday morning were 275 kilometers an hour.
But even that reading would still make Haiyan the world's strongest typhoon this year, according to David Michael Padua, a meteorologist with the Weather Philippines Foundation, a storm monitoring organisation that runs the www.weather.com.ph website.

earthquake,"7.5-magnitude quake hits near Russia's Kuril Islands MOSCOW: A 7.5-magnitude quake hit off Russia's Kuril Islands on Wednesday (Mar 25), the US Geological Survey said, although there was no tsunami threat as previously reported. The quake hit at a depth of 59km, around 1,400km northeast of the Japanese city of Sapporo, USGS added. There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said soon after the quake that a tsunami watch was issued for the state of Hawaii, while another agency, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, said the quake had potential to generate a destructive tsunami. ""Tsunami waves are forecast to be less than 0.3 meters above the tide level,"" the center said in its advisory about risks to the coasts of Hawaii, Japan, Russia and the Pacific islands of Midway, the Northern Marianas and Wake Island. In an update about an hour later, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center cancelled the tsunami warning, saying that ""only very small tsunami waves were generated by this earthquake and there is no further threat"". The four southernmost islands of the Kuril chain - Habomai, Shikotan, Etorofu and Kunashiri - have been disputed between Moscow and Tokyo since the end of World War II. The Kurils are known as the Northern Territories in Japan."
Typhoon,"Typhoon Jebi, the strongest storm to hit Japan in 25 years, has flooded one of the country's major airports.
As the cyclone made landfall along the west coast of the country, Kansai International Airport which is built on a manmade island, is just over three miles off the coast of Osaka Prefecture, was struck.
The storm's strong winds caused a tanker weighing over 2,500-tonnes to crash into the bridge connecting the airport to Izumisano City on the mainland.
The bridge suffered heavy damage but the Japanese coast guard have said that none of the vessel’s 11 crew members were injured.
However, one person in Shiga prefecture has been killed following a warehouse collapse, with five more injured.

Typhoon,"Tropical Storm Cristobal brings heavy rain and flooding to southern US Tropical Storm Cristobal made landfall on Louisiana’s coastline on Sunday 7 June, but the impacts of the storm were felt far and wide. Rainfall rates of 152.4mm an hour were recorded in Florida resulting in flash flooding destroying cars, as well as a tornado forming in downtown Orlando. Prior to landfall on US soil, Cristobal brought destruction along the Gulf of Mexico, with nearly 328.9mm of rain falling in a 24-hour period causing significant flooding, cutting off communities, and triggering landslides. Cristobal is the third named storm of an already busy Atlantic hurricane season. The start of the monsoon season was officially announced last week in Kerala, India, where favourable conditions for the south-west monsoon have developed. The monsoon season is critical for the agricultural sector, which accounts for approximately 15% India’s economy, playing a vital role in crop irrigation. However, heavy monsoon rains can be hazardous too, bringing the threat of landslides and flash flooding, frequently resulting in the loss of life. In the central Netherlands, three waterspouts developed over Markermeer Lake, near Lelystad, on Friday. These waterspouts formed as a series of heavy showers passed over the region from the east, these showers later developing into a thunderstorm."
Typhoon,"NASA sees record-breaking new Tropical Storm Gonzalo strengthening The seventh named tropical cyclone of the North Atlantic Ocean has formed, and like some others this season, it has broken a record. NASA's Aqua satellite provided a look at the small record-breaker. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) reports that Gonzalo is the earliest seventh named storm on record in the Atlantic basin, beating Gert of 2005 by 2 days. Tropical Depression Seven formed on July 21 by 5 p.m. EDT in the Central North Atlantic Ocean, and by 8:50 a.m. EDT on July 22 it strengthened into a tropical storm and was renamed Gonzalo. One of the ways NASA researches tropical cyclones is using infrared data that provides temperature information. The AIRS instrument aboard NASA's Aqua satellite captured a look at those temperatures in Gonzalo and gave insight into the size of the storm and its rainfall potential. Cloud top temperatures provide information to forecasters about where the strongest storms are located within a tropical cyclone. Tropical cyclones do not always have uniform strength, and some sides have stronger sides than others. The stronger the storms, the higher they extend into the troposphere, and the colder the cloud temperatures. NASA provides that data to forecasters at NOAA's National Hurricane Center or NHC so they can incorporate it in their forecasting. On July 22 at 12:11 a.m. EDT (0411 UTC) NASA's Aqua satellite analyzed the storm using the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder or AIRS instrument. AIRS found coldest cloud top temperatures as cold as or colder than minus 63 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 53 degrees Celsius). NASA research has shown that cloud top temperatures that cold indicate strong storms that have the capability to create heavy rain."
Typhoon,"Typhoon Fitow barrelled into China's east coast early Monday, packing winds of more than 200 kilometres an hour after hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated, state media reported.
At least two people were reported killed, both near Wenzhou in Zhejiang province, the state news agency Xinhua said.
Parts of Zhejiang, which neighbours the commercial hub Shanghai, saw nearly 29 centimetres (11 inches) of rain over 17 hours from Sunday to early Monday, while areas in Fujian to the south saw up to 16 centimetres, the official China News Service said.
In the hard-hit Cangnan county in Wenzhou, more than 1,200 homes collapsed and damages amounted to hundreds of millions of yuan, China National Radio said.
One of the victims, 55-year-old Ni Wenlin, died ""after strong wind blew him off a hill"" late Sunday, Xinhua said, citing municipal flood control authorities.
In Fujian the typhoon broke electricity poles in half, leaving power lines on the ground, and bent iron roadsigns out of shape, CNR reported.
In the coastal city of Ningde, a village leader told the Beijing Times that huge waves had damaged a 200-hectare (490-acre) seaweed farm, which nearly 100 families depended on for their livelihood.
The typhoon ""broke the bamboo poles holding the seaweed in place"", said Lin Fangqin.
The storm is expected to move northwest but ""weaken quickly"", Xinhua said on Monday, citing the National Meteorological Centre (NMC).
Authorities evacuated hundreds of thousands of people and issued China's highest alert on Sunday as Fitow approached the mainland.
The NMC issued a red alert for the storm, which was packing winds of up to 151 kilometres (94 miles) an hour late Sunday night as it moved towards the coast
Winds rose to 201 km per hour in parts of Wenzhou, the official Xinhua news agency reported later, citing local flood control authorities.
Zhejiang has so far evacuated more than 574,000 people, while in Fujian 177,000 have been displaced, Xinhua said.
Two port workers in Wenzhou were missing and may have fallen into the sea, the agency added.
Zhejiang governor Li Qiang urged local authorities to increase inspections of dams and reservoirs as well as safety checks of chemical plants and other important facilities, Xinhua reported.
The storm also forced the suspension of bullet train services in several cities in Zhejiang, Fujian and Jiangxi provinces, Xinhua said.
Wenzhou's airport cancelled 27 flights Sunday, the agency said.
Xinhua quoted the weather centre as saying it was unusual for a typhoon to come ashore in China's southeast during October, at the end of the storm season.
Chinese maritime authorities also issued red alerts, warning of storm tides and waves, with fishermen urged to return to port and local authorities told to prepare harbour facilities and sea walls for high tides.
In Zhejiang more than 35,000 boats returned to harbour while in Fujian nearly 30,000 vessels were called back, according to Xinhua.
Named after a flower from Micronesia, Fitow has hit just two weeks after Typhoon Usagi wreaked havoc in the region, leaving at least 25 reported dead in southern China.
Fitow, which Xinhua described as the 23rd storm to hit China this year, earlier passed through Japan's southern Okinawan island chain, forcing flight cancellations and causing power outages.
Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau had issued a warning over the storm Sunday morning as it surged past the north of the island.
A total of 103 international flights were cancelled in Taiwan, while 14 flights were delayed. Seventeen ferry services between Taiwan and offshore islands were also halted."
earthquake,"Tsunami advisory issued after earthquake strikes off Japan's coast TOKYO — An earthquake struck off Japan's northeast coast Saturday, shaking buildings even in Tokyo and triggering a tsunami advisory for a part of the northern coast. The Meteorological Agency of Japan said in a statement that the quake struck at 6:09 p.m. local time (6:09 a.m. ET) near the Miyagi Prefecture, which was heavily damaged during the huge earthquake and tsunami of 2011, that killed thousands and made global headlines. No major damage has been reported, according to Japan's public broadcaster NHK, and there have been no reports of severe injuries. The earthquake was initially recorded as having a magnitude of 7.2 , which was downgraded later on Saturday to 6.9 by the Japan Meteorological Agency, which also re-adjusted its calculations of the depth of the epicenter to 59 km from 60 km. An initial advisory for a tsunami up to 1 meter in height for Miyagi prefecture immediately after the quake, was also lifted by Japan's Meteorological Agency later on Saturday. The U.S. Pacific Tsunami Warning Center rescinded a similar tsunami advisory notice that had been issued. ""Based on all available data, the tsunami threat from this earthquake has now passed,"" it said in a statement."
other,"St Vincent volcano: Eruptions likely in coming days, experts warn The Caribbean island of St Vincent is likely to see further volcanic eruptions and ash fall over the coming days, experts have warned. The La Soufrière volcano first erupted on Friday, blanketing the island in a layer of ash and forcing more than 16,000 people to evacuate their homes. Smaller explosions continued over the weekend, causing power cuts and disrupting water supplies. Emergency officials have described the landscape as a ""battle zone"". ""The volcano continues to erupt explosively with the production of copious amounts of ash,"" the University of the West Indies' Seismic Research Center said. ""Explosions and accompanying ash fall, of similar or larger magnitude, are likely to continue to occur over the next few days impacting St Vincent and neighbouring islands,"" it warned."
Typhoon,"Galveston, Texas: Hurricane Laura made landfall near Cameron in Louisiana on Thursday afternoon (AEST) as one of the region's worst hurricanes, threatening to devastate the US Gulf Coast with catastrophic storm surges, flash floods and powerful winds that could leave areas uninhabitable for weeks or months.
It came ashore as a category four storm with maximum winds of about 240km/h, according to the National Hurricane Centre. Laura is strong enough to rip down houses, uproot trees and cause power outages that could last weeks or even months.The storm is set to push a wall of water more than 6.1 metres high in some places on to shore, with potentially deadly effects - a catastrophic surge the centre earlier described as ""unsurvivable"".
It could inflict more than US15 billion (20 billion) in insured losses.
It is just a few kilometres per hour short of the most powerful storm category possible, and it's matching the previous record-breaker, the Lost Island Hurricane of 1856.
Some additional strengthening is possible before Laura reaches the north-west US Gulf of Mexico coast, the centre said. It's coming with more power than Hurricane Harvey when it made landfall in Texas in 2017.

Typhoon,"Typhoon Wipha, currently located in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, is pushing to the northeast towards Japan over the next 24 hours. It will likely bring heavy rain, gusty winds, and large surf across the east coast of Japan today (October 15, 2013). Fortunately, Wipha is projected to weaken as it moves over cold waters and into an atmosphere that is unfavorable for strengthening as wind shear increases. Still, Typhoon Wipha is likely to add more problems to those trying to fix Japan’s damaged Fukushima nuclear plant, where there have been leaks of radioactive water into the ocean and several workers last week were accidentally doused with radioactive water.
As of October 15 at 9Z (or 5 a.m. EST), the Joint Typhoon Warning Center reports that Typhoon Wipha contains 80-knot winds, which is estimated around 90 miles per hour (mph) or 148 kilometers per hour (kph). The storm is accelerating to the northeast at 17 knots.
At one point, Wipha was a strong Category 4 typhoon with sustained winds around 130 mph this past Sunday. Now, Wipha is transitioning from a tropical system into an extratropical system. What does that mean? It means that its winds will likely expand outward and create a larger impact across Japan today. Rainfall totals of 3-7 inches are possible.
The extra rain and large surf is a major concern for the Fukushima plant trying to recover since the tragic earthquake and tsunami devastated the area back in 2011. Wipha will only complicate matters and result in delays in trying to fix radioactive leaks."
earthquake,"A strong earthquake killed at least six people and damaged buildings on Indonesia's main island of Java and shook the tourist hotspot of Bali, officials said Saturday. No tsunami warnings were posted.
The U.S. Geological Survey said the magnitude 6.0 quake struck off the island's southern coast at 2:00 p.m. local time (0700 GMT). It was centered 45 kilometers (28 miles) south of Sumberpucung town of Malang District in East Java province, at a depth of 82 kilometers (51 miles).
Rahmat Triyono, the head of Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami center, said in a statement the undersea earthquake did not have the potential to cause a tsunami. Still, he urged people to stay away from slopes of soil or rocks that have the potential for landslides.
Falling rocks killed a woman on a motorcycle and badly injured her husband in East Java's Lumajang district, said Raditya Jati, spokesperson for the National Disaster Mitigation Agency.
He said dozens of homes were damaged across the district, and rescuers had retrieved two bodies from the rubble of collapsed homes in the district's Kali Uling village. Two people were also confirmed killed in an area bordering Lumajang and Malang districts, while one person found dead under rubble in Malang.
Television reports showed people running in panic from malls and buildings in several cities in East Java province
Indonesia's search and rescue agency released videos and photos of damaged houses and buildings, including a ceiling at a hospital in Blitar, a city neighboring Malang. Authorities were still collecting information about the full scale of casualties and damage in the affected areas.
It was the second deadly disaster to hit Indonesia this week. On Sunday, a downpour triggered by Tropical Cyclone Seroja killed at least 165 people and damaged thousands of houses. Some were buried in either mudslides or solidified lava from a volcanic eruption in November, while others were swept away by flash flooding.
Indonesia, a vast archipelago of 270 million people, is frequently struck by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis because of its location on the ""Ring of Fire,"" an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin.
In January, a magnitude 6.2 earthquake killed at least 105 people and injured nearly 6,500, while more than 92,000 displaced, after striking Mamuju and Majene districts in West Sulawesi province."
Typhoon,"At least 10,000 people are thought to have died in the central Philippine province of Leyte after_yphoon Haiyan, one of the strongest storms ever to make landfall, lashed the area, swallowing coastal towns, a senior police official said early on Sunday morning.
About 70-80% of the buildings in the area in the path of Haiyan in Leyte province was destroyed, said chief superintendent Elmer Soria. ""We had a meeting last night with the governor and the other officials. The governor said based on their estimate, 10,000 died,"" he said.
Tacloban city administrator Tecson Lim said that the death toll in that city alone ""could go up to 10,000"". Tacloban is the provincial capital of Leyte, with a population of more than 200,000. The Philippine Red Cross said in Tacloban bodies had been found ""piled up around the roads"" and in churches. Between 300 and 400 bodies had been recovered, Lim said.
On Samar island, which faces Tacloban, Leo Dacaynos of the provincial disaster office told Associated Press on Sunday 300 people were confirmed dead in Basey town and another 2,000 were missing.
He said the storm surge caused sea waters to rise 20 feet when the typhoon hit. There were still towns on Samar that had not been reached, he said, and appealed for food and water. Power was knocked out and there was no mobile signal, making communication possible only by radio.
Many corpses hung on tree branches, buildings and sidewalks, Associated Press reported.
""On the way to the airport we saw many bodies along the street,"" said Philippine-born Australian Mila Ward, 53, who was waiting at the Tacloban airport to catch a military flight back to Manila.
""They were covered with just anything tarpaulin, roofing sheets, cardboards,"" she said. Asked how many, she said, ""Well over 100 where we passed.""
The super-typhoon made landfall on Samar and Leyte islands in the eastern Visayas at about 4.40am on Friday local time, with winds up to 315km/h (195mph) tearing roofs off buildings, turning roads into rivers full of debris and knocking out electricity pylons.
With many provinces left without power or telecommunications, and airports in the hardest-hit areas, such as Tacloban, in tatters, experts say it is impossible to know the extent of the storm's damage _ or deliver badly needed aid.
Roughly 12 hours after the 600km (370-mile)-wide Haiyan blew west towards Vietnam, where it is expected to make landfall early on Sunday, officials and aid workers are only now beginning to piece together details on the number of dead and injured.
Government figures showed that more than 4 million had been directly affected. The World Food Programme has mobilised some $2m (£1.25m) in aid and aims to deliver 40 tonnes of fortified biscuits to victims within the next few days.
Satellite images show normally green patches of vegetation ripped up into brown squares of debris in Tacloban, where local TV channel GMA broadcast images of huge storm surges, flattened buildings and families traipsing through flooded streets with their possessions held high above the water.
The head of the UN Disaster Assessment Co-ordination Team, Sebastian Rhodes Stampa, described ""destruction on a massive scale"" in the city of 220,000 and said: ""The last time I saw something of this scale was in the aftermath of the Indian Ocean tsunami. There are cars thrown like tumbleweed and the streets are strewn with debris.""
Al-Jazeera correspondent Jamela Alindogan was trapped in her hotel as the eye of the storm passed overhead and ripped the roof off the building. Evoking scenes of chaos as badly hurt victims wandered the streets without medicine, food or water, and doctors at the local hospital attended to the wounded in the dark without electricity or candlelight, she said: ""There is no food, not even in the hotels, and there's no water. The situation is really very desperate.""
Other sources told of victims trying to climb out from under rubble to find assistance, and mobs rampaging through the streets looking for food, water or medicine, and looting electrical goods and groceries from malls. ""Almost all the houses were destroyed,"" said Major Rey Balido of the_hilippines_ational disaster agency. ""Only a few are left standing.""
Relatives of those living in the typhoon's path have had no news from their loved ones and are nervously waiting until power is restored to the area. ""I spoke to my mother just a few hours before the typhoon made landfall in my city, Tacloban,"" said taxi driver Sherwin Martinata, 32, in the capital, Manila. ""She was saying she was all right but now I have no idea if my family is safe. There is no power, no phones. I can't get through at all. I'm worried, but I'm powerless.""
Those living in the hardest-hit areas, such as the eastern Visayas, are among the poorest in the Philippines, say aid agencies, who warn that there will be little or no savings for many of the victims to fall back on _ putting an already vulnerable population at even greater risk of future food and job insecurity.
On Bohol island _ where a 7.3-magnitude earthquake toppled colonial-era churches and killed some 200 people last month _ residents were successfully evacuated ahead of the storm and as a result many lives were probably saved, said Mathias Eick of the European commission's humanitarian aid department (Echo). However, because the island's main power supply comes from neighbouring Leyte, residents are still without electricity or water.
In Tacloban, where many residents live along the coast, the sheer force of the storm was just too much for the buildings to withstand, with evacuation centres such as stadiums and churches later collapsing. ""The sheer magnitude and scale of the disaster sort of overpowered all the contingency measures, and we're fearing that we'll be finding more dead bodies in those evacuation centres themselves,"" said Alwynn Javier of Christian Aid.
Without information on the ground or access to hard-hit areas, aid agencies have been stuck, not knowing how much aid is needed or which areas need it most.
""The only information we have been able to get so far is from the UN and some from the news,"" said Javier. ""We should have good ground reach, but are really impeded by this lack of access because even our partners on the ground have been hit themselves.""
Officials and rescue workers hoped that Sunday would see concerted efforts by authorities to set up command centres and rescue groups, which will in turn help bring supplies to those who need them most. But gaining access to those areas will prove hard, said Richard Gordon of the Philippine Red Cross, who added that without bulldozers or tractors to clear paths, volunteers will have to bring cutting equipment to clear uprooted trees and debris.
The Philippines sees roughly 20 typhoons every year, with some more devastating than others. Last year's Typhoon Bopha killed more than 1,100 people and caused over $1bn in damage.
Haiyan _ the 25th typhoon to hit the Philippines this year _ is expected to make landfall in several provinces in central Vietnam with winds around 220km/h (137mph). More than 450,000 troops have been deployed, as well as 12 planes, 356 ships and thousands of vehicles, in order to mobilise supplies, with more than 300,000 people evacuated in Da Nang and Quang Ngai provinces.
""It may be the strongest storm to hit Vietnam in history,"" said Vietnam's director of the Central Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting Centre in Bui Minh Tang. Coastal areas should expect to see waves as high as 5-8 meters (16-26ft) and a wind radius up to 500km wide, officials warned."
wildfires,"Kangaroo Island is Australia’s third largest. Its glossy black cockatoos have been one of Australia’s conservation success stories. Thanks to a recovery program that began in 1995, their numbers in the wild increased from 150 to 400. Scientists responded by downgrading the birds’ status from critically endangered with extinction to just endangered.
But that all changed in January. Now this bird is part of an unfolding horror story.
Fires have raged across nearly 50 percent of Kangaroo Island. That’s their 4,400-square-kilometer (1,700-square-mile) isle off the coast of the state of South Australia. Flames destroyed the habitat for most of the birds. It’s unclear how many glossy black cockatoos survived. For those that did, food may now be scarce. These birds eat the seeds of a single tree species: the drooping she oak.
Many years of hard work to save these birds have gone up in smoke, says Daniella Teixeira. She’s a conservation biologist who works 2,184 kilometers (some 1,360 miles) away at Australia’s University of Queensland in Brisbane. This fire has brought “a big step backwards for the recovery team,” Teixeira concludes. And it’s something she understands well. She has studied and worked to protect these cockatoos for the last four years. Even if just one in every four of the birds died, she says, this subspecies could again be deemed critically endangered with extinction.
Similar stories are playing out across Australia. As of January 12, months of wildfires had burned nearly 11 million hectares (more than 42,470 square miles). That’s an area larger than the nation of Guatemala and a little bigger than the state of Tennessee. More than 2,200 homes have gone up in flames and 29 people died. And another two months of bush-fire season still remains. Already, the toll on animals and plants, many of which are unique — found nowhere outside Australia — boggles the mind."
Typhoon,"Hanna is expected to be a hurricane before it makes landfall in Texas Tropical Storm Hanna to bring flooding rain to Texas 01:09 (CNN)The earliest H-named storm ever in the Atlantic basin is gaining strength and forecast to make landfall as a hurricane in Texas on Saturday afternoon or evening. Tropical Storm Hanna is forecast to be a Category 1 hurricane with sustained winds of 75 mph when it makes landfall along the south-central coast of Texas, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida. ""Steady strengthening is forecast for the next 24 hours, and Hanna is expected to become a hurricane before the cyclone makes landfall,"" according to an advisory from the hurricane center. The storm currently has sustained winds of 65 mph that extend 60 miles out from the center as it moves across the Gulf of Mexico toward Texas. ""Storms like Hanna in the Gulf of Mexico are notoriously the hardest to forecast,"" CNN meteorologist Chad Myers says. ""The water is so warm under the storm that rapid intensification can happen at any time, especially overnight when atmospheric shear goes down naturally. "" Shear is the changing of wind speed and direction with height and can inhibit hurricanes from forming. If Hanna strengthens into a hurricane, it will be the first hurricane of the season in the Atlantic. As of 10 p.m. Friday, the storm was 165 miles (270 km) east-southeast of Corpus Christi, Texas. An eye is beginning to form based off radar imagery, the hurricane center said, which means the storm is better organized and developing a stronger core structure."

The interpreters are being resettled under a visa programme for those who worked with the US during the recently ended 20-year war with the Taliban.
They arrived in the early hours of Friday morning and were taken to Fort Lee military base in Virginia.
They are expected to stay there for around a week while they are processed.
In a statement, US President Joe Biden called the arrivals ""a milestone"" and ""the first of many"" as US authorities work to relocate eligible Afghans out of harm's way.
Afghans eligible for Special Immigrant Visas (SIV) will be transported either to the US, American facilities abroad or to third countries while they finish their applications. The most recent arrivals have already completed an extensive vetting process.
On Thursday, the US Senate approved more than $1bn (£719m) to pay for the evacuations, including housing and transportation.
The bill would also loosen applicant requirements and allow for 8,000 more visas in addition to the ones already allocated for.
The Taliban have been advancing Afghanistan following a decision by Mr Biden to withdraw the remaining American troops from the country.
With those advances have come danger to those who worked alongside US troops during the two-decade conflict.
Since 2008, approximately 70,000 Afghans have been resettled in the US on an SIV .
Last week, a senior state department official said that the total number of visa applicants now stands just over 20,000. About half have yet to complete the first steps of the process."
Typhoon,"Thousands of people in Vietnam sought shelter as a powerful tropical storm barrelled towards its northern coast on Friday, after killing 43 people in the Philippines and slamming into southeast China. Beijing, which had issued its first red typhoon alert of the year, downgraded Typhoon Nesat to a ""strong tropical storm"" as it slowed at sea, after forcing 300,000 people to evacuate on the tropical island of Hainan. Gale force winds and torrential rain continued to lash China's southeast coast on Friday and high winds buffeted Hanoi, where forecasters said Nesat would hit Vietnam's northeast coast in the afternoon. In the Philippines, tens of thousands of people battled neck-deep floodwaters after Nesat's deadly path across Luzon. The government there said nearly a million people had been affected by the flooding and that another typhoon, Nalgae, was forecast to dump more rain across the main island of Luzon from Saturday. Severe floods have also devastated swathes of Southeast Asia, with eight people, mostly children, reported dead in Vietnam's southern Mekong Delta provinces. Unusually severe monsoon rains have killed almost 190 people in Thailand over the past two months and claimed more than 100 lives in Cambodia."
Typhoon,"Tokyo: Hundreds fled their homes on Sunday on a Japanese island already devastated by a typhoon for fear that torrential rain would trigger fresh mudslides.
The town of Oshima, 120 kilometres south of Tokyo, advised 2,300 residents in two districts on the island of the same name to evacuate, saying rain was expected to intensify due to a depression.
A total of 632 people had taken shelter in school gyms and community halls by early afternoon, an official at the town’s administrative office said.
Many others were staying at relatives’ homes in safer areas of the island, she said.
The meteorological agency has warned that rainfall could reach 40 millimetres per hour in the afternoon and has urged residents to be on alert.
The rain could trigger fresh landslides on the island where at least 27 residents were killed as a typhoon struck last week. Two others died in or near Tokyo.
Twenty-one people were still missing but search operations were suspended due to the bad weather.
Military airplanes flew 14 inpatients at the island’s medical centre to hospitals in central Tokyo while Prime Minister Shinzo Abe cancelled his visit to the island set for Sunday.
Powerful typhoon Wipha triggered mudslides that buried some 30 houses and damaged more than 300 structures on Oshima last week.
Empress Michiko cancelled events scheduled Sunday at the imperial palace in Tokyo to celebrate her 79th birthday in the wake of the disaster.

About 20 people have been injured fleeing the blazes, while hundreds of firefighters have been deployed, struggling as 90km/h (56mph) gusts of wind fan the flames.
A forest fire is also raging in the parched Caceres region of southwestern Spain, again fuelled by strong gusts of wind. Spanish media say seven helicopters and two planes are trying to douse the flames with water, on a front two to three kilometres (1.5 miles) wide.
About 50 people have been evacuated from the village of Cambron in the affected area, which is mostly wild pine forest.
In Catalonia about 1,300 people left their homes in Alt Emporda district and spent the night in sports halls and social clubs."
earthquake,"Rescuers race to find Turkey quake survivors, at least 39 dead BAYRAKLI, Turkey: Rescuers dug through heavy blocks of concrete with their bare hands on Saturday (Oct 31) in a desperate search for survivors from a powerful earthquake that levelled buildings across Greece and Turkey, killing at least 30 people. The 7.0-magnitude quake killed 28 people and injured nearly 900 in Turkey after striking on Friday afternoon near the west coast town of Seferihisar in Izmir province. Also killing two teenagers on their way home from school in Greece, it caused a mini-tsunami on the Aegean island of Samos and a sea surge that turned streets into rushing rivers in one Turkish coastal town. Felt in both Istanbul and Athens, it also created a diplomatic opening for the two historic rivals, with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis placing a rare call to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to offer his condolences and support."
earthquake,"An earthquake of 7.2 magnitude has struck off the coast of Japan, shaking buildings in the capital, Tokyo, and triggering a small tsunami.
The tremor was centred 168km (104 miles) from the east coast, north-east of Tokyo.
A 60cm (24in) tsunami reached the coastal town of Ofunato, with other towns reporting smaller waves shortly after the quake hit at 1145 (0245 GMT).
There are so far no reports of damage or injuries.
Japan is well-prepared for quakes which often hit the seismically active area.
An aftershock measuring 6.3 magnitude struck after the main quake, Japan's meteorological agency said, followed by a series of smaller aftershocks.
Some train services in the area were temporarily halted after the quake, but they were restarted shortly after noon.
Tohoku Electric Power said its Onagawa nuclear plant was operating normally after the quake and Tokyo Electric Power also said its power supplies were unaffected."
drought,"Ongoing drought in Idaho will drastically shorten this year’s irrigation season for some farmers, officials said.
Farmers in south-central Idaho’s Wood River basin will face some of the biggest shortages, with an estimated 40 to 45 days before water from the Magic Reservoir runs out, according to David Stephenson, manager of Big Wood Canal Co. In a normal season, farmers might get water into late September.
Magic Reservoir, which supplies water to 36,000 acres of farmland, was only about a quarter full this year before dams were released last week, kicking off the season.
The reservoir holds water that flows through Big Wood River from melted snowfall in the mountains. The river is flowing at about 16% of its normal rate this year after record-low winter precipitation levels, Boise State Public Radio reported.
Prior to the winter, a dry summer and fall last year meant groundwater was already depleted as irrigators south of Bellevue pumped out of the aquifer, searching for any leftover moisture.
Carl Pendleton, a farmer who gets all of his water from Magic Reservoir, said the outlook is dismal.
“I sold my cow herd last week, the first time I’ve been out of livestock in my lifetime,” he said. “That’s the decisions we’re making based on this amount of water.”
The Idaho Department of Water Resources this spring could decide to curtail groundwater pumping to the north, which Pendleton said goes unchecked and exacerbates the shortages so that there isn’t enough to go around.
The federal Natural Resources Conservation Service said Lost River, parts of the Snake River and the Oakley and Salmon Falls reservoirs will also feel the effects of the drought."
Typhoon,"NASA satellite data revealed that the day after Typhoon Utor made landfall in southern China, its circulation still appeared intact despite weakening over land.
Typhoon Utor's eye made landfall around 0730 UTC/3:30 a.m. EDT on Aug. 14. On Aug. 15, Utor was still dropping rain over southern China.
NASA's Terra satellite passed over China at 03:25 UTC on Aug. 15 (11:25 p.m. EDT) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer or MODIS instrument captured a visible image of Utor. The MODIS image showed Utor still had a circulation, despite weakening to a low pressure area.
On Aug. 15, Utor was raining over the western part of the Guandong Province, the eastern part of the Guangxi Province and southern part of the Hunan Province. Despite areas of moderate rainfall, all warnings had been dropped by the China Meteorological Administration on Aug. 15.
Aljazeera News reported that Utor was responsible for the death of one person and five people were still missing as of Aug. 15. Utor was the twelfth tropical cyclone to hit China in 2013."
wildfires,"The number of Alaska's active wildfires is literally off the charts, according to a map recently released by the state's Division of Forestry.
Over 700 fires have burned so far this summer, the most in the state's history, and that number is only expected to get bigger as the state is experiencing higher temperatures, lower humidity and more lightning storms than usual, said Kale Casey, a public information officer for the Alaska Interagency Coordination Center, which serves as a focal point for state agencies involved in wildland fire management and suppression.
""Exactly around 1.88 million acres of land have been burned so far, which is at pace with the 2004 season when 6.59 million acres burned,"" Casey told ABC News today. ""In addition to the dry season we're having, we've had a huge amount of lightning -- about 6,000 to 10,000 bolts per day. There was three-day period in June where we had over 31,000 lightning strikes."""
other,"Taal volcano's inner lake all but gone in eruption The Taal volcano in the Philippines continued erupting on Thursday, albeit with less of the ash production seen earlier in the week. Scientists are monitoring the situation remotely, using ground and space instrumentation, to try to gauge what might happen next. The radar image on this page is the latest to come down from the Iceye radar constellation. The Finnish system senses in the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, which gives it the ability to see through ejected ash and any cloud to detect directly the hard surface below. The data reveals how the inner lake (""Yellow Lake"") that once filled the very heart of the Taal volcano island has now almost completely disappeared. It was the interaction of this water with magma that drove a lot of the early explosive behaviour. The dashed line shows the extent of the lake before the onset of Sunday's eruption phase. The solid line traces the waterline at the time of Thursday's image acquisition (06:37 GMT)."
Typhoon,"The death toll from twin typhoons that pounded the Philippines has reached 59, authorities said.
Typhoon Nesat -- known locally as Pedring -- has claimed 55 lives, and the death toll from Nalgae -- known locally as Quiel -- rose to four Monday as rescuers found the body of a man who drowned in raging floodwaters in Bulacan province.
Several towns in Bulacan and Pampanga provinces, in Central Luzon, were under chest-deep water when continuous rains from Typhoon Nesat last week prompted the release of water from four dams around the area. Among the worst hit was the city of Calumpit, Bulacan, where residents were stranded on rooftops for days.
Although floodwaters have begun to subside, hundreds of families remained in evacuation centers as more than 43,000 houses were damaged by Typhoon Nesat alone, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council said. It estimated damages to infrastructure and agriculture at more than 8 billion Philippine pesos (almost $183 million).
Several dikes have also been breached in Pampanga province during Typhoon Nesat."
Typhoon,"Typhoon Haikui slammed into the east coast of China on Wednesday morning, pummeling the area around the business metropolis of Shanghai with heavy wind and rain.
The storm's winds were at ""severe typhoon"" strength when it made landfall in the province of Zhejiang, about 225 kilometers (140 miles) south of Shanghai, the China Meteorological Administration said. The winds diminished to typhoon strength as Haikui moved inland.
A severe typhoon is considered to have maximum sustained wind speed of between 150 and 184 kilometers per hour (93 and 114 mph). A typhoon has maximum sustained winds of between 118 and 149 kilometers per hour (73 and 93 mph)."
Typhoon,"Typhoon Haikui had been downgraded to a severe tropical storm as of 4 p.m. Wednesday in east China's Zhejiang province and will soon enter neighboring Anhui province, the provincial flood control and drought relief headquarters said.
Typhoon Haikui, which made landfall in Zhejiang at 3:20 a.m. Wednesday, has brought heavy downpours to east China and killed three people there.
Shanghai was lashed by a typhoon-triggered rainstorm, with maximum precipitation approaching 130 mm in some areas, the local observatory said.
Two people died and seven were injured by Typhoon-triggered accidents in Shanghai, according to the city's flood control and draught relief headquarters.
Around 7 a.m., a woman died after being hit in the head by a piece of falling glass in Baoshan district. At 11 a.m., the wall of a factory in Songjiang district collapsed and fell onto a neighboring dormitory, killing one and injuring three in the dormitory."
wildfires,"The Alaska Interagency Coordination Center was tracking 290 fires in Alaska on July 25, with ""very large"" fires spread across southern Alaska, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The 2015 Alaska fire season is already the third-largest season since reliable records began in 1950, and more than 4.75 million acres have burned. That amount of acreage is more than double the size of Yellowstone National Park and larger than the state of New Jersey, which consists of only 4.492 million acres.
According to USGS, there is not a direct relationship between climate change and fire, ""but researchers have found strong correlations between warm June temperatures and large fire years. Hot, dry spring conditions, however, do not automatically mean fire—something needs to create the spark and actually start the fire. Lightning starts about 35 percent of the fires in Alaska but account for 90 percent of the total area burned.""
Wildfires can alter wildlife habitat, such as by destroying slow-growing lichens in black spruce forests, an important winter food source for caribou.
The fires being tracked are shown on this UAFSMOKE page. It is an initiative supported by the Arctic Region Supercomputing Center and the Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska Fairbanks, in cooperation with colleagues from NOAA's Global System Division, Brazil's Center for Weather Forecasting and Climate Studies (CPTEC/INPE), and the USFS Missoula Fire Sciences Lab."
earthquake,"Large earthquake strikes off coast of Russia and Japan A powerful earthquake has struck off the coast of Russia and Japan.  The magnitude 6.9 quake hit offshore 99 kilometres (62 miles) southeast of Russia‘s Kuril Islands, the US Geological Survey (USGS) said on Thursday. It also struck off the coast of Japan’s northern main island of Hokkaido, according to Japan’s meteorological agency.  The agency said it was centred about 60 kilometres (100 miles) below the ocean’s surface and east of Etorofu island _ a Russian-held island that is also claimed by Japan. Officials said it was unlikely to cause injuries or damage because of its depth and distance from the coast."
drought,"The U.S. Drought Monitor recently reported that, for the first time in its nearly 20-year history, none of the contiguous states was showing symptoms of severe or exceptional drought. That report includes Arizona, as this year’s abnormally wet May helped push the state out of a 10-year drought period.
According to the monitor’s weekly report for late last week, only 20.5% of Arizona was showing moderate drought or “abnormally dry” symptoms. Data for the same week in 2018 found 100% of the state in moderate drought or abnormally dry, with a majority of the state experiencing severe (97%) or extreme drought (73.2%).
Richard Heim, a meteorologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Centers for Environmental Information, said the change was tied to this year’s wet spring.
“Rain and snow have been falling in the areas that needed it, so the drought’s contracted a lot,” he said.
Arizona is no stranger to downpours in the monsoon season, which runs June 15 to Sept. 30, according the National Weather Service, but heavy rain and snowfall in spring isn’t typical for the Southwest.
State climatologist Nancy Selover said the increased rain and snow came from winter storms over the Southwest that lingered longer and provided more moisture than in the past."
Typhoon,"The storm, named Bolaven, buffeted the west coast of South Korea with winds of up to 170 kilometers (106 miles) per hour, knocking out power to more than 200,000 homes.
According to South Korean emergency services, coast guard rescuers were able to save 10 fishermen from two Chinese ships after their boats capsized near Jeju island, about 100 kilometers south of the mainland. Five fishermen were thought to have perished. Ten crew members remain missing.
In the dramatic rescue, coast guard members in wetsuits overcame high waves by firing a line-launcher to attach ropes to one of the ships. According to AFP, the other boat broke apart.
In southern Wanju county, the public administration ministry said a 48-year-old man was killed when strong winds flipped over a shipping container, while in the southwest city of Gwangju an elderly woman was killed when a church spire fell onto her house. The public administration ministry also said another elderly woman was killed in Seocheon county on the country's west coast when she was blown off a roof.
Elsewhere, South Korea's transport ministry said that almost 250 flights, both international and domestic, had been cancelled since Monday, and that all 87 sea ferry services had been temporarily suspended. The US and South Korean military also decided to call off large-scale joint military exercises that began last week. The United States has a large military presence in South Korea."
Typhoon,"Cristobal will move into Canada as widespread severe storms impact the Great Lakes region (CNN)What's left of Cristobal has survived its long trek up the Mississippi River Valley, causing widespread flooding. Now, Cristobal is heading into Canada as an extra-tropical storm, bringing widespread thunderstorms to the Great Lakes region. ""As the remnants of Cristobal lifts very quickly to the north, the system will bring strong severe storms to portions of the Great Lakes, more specifically Michigan and Ohio this afternoon,"" CNN meteorologist Haley Brink says. ""Due to the speed of this system, severe damaging winds may be the more widespread threat through the afternoon and evening hours, with tornadoes also possible."" Cristobal's remnants are providing a very moist environment for these storms to thrive. And with an advancing cold front right on its heels, the two systems will clash and bring tropical-like storms to the region and a line of strong storms associated with the advancing cold front. According to the Weather Prediction Center, ""a sharp cold front in the wake of Cristobal will spread strong gusty winds and some thunderstorms throughout the Central Plains and Upper Midwest today, and into the Great Lakes through tonight."" The Storm Prediction Center has issued a moderate risk -- level 4 of 5 -- for severe thunderstorms, including tornadoes for Wednesday afternoon and tonight. Over 8 million people are in this risk area, including much of eastern Michigan and northwest Ohio. A level 3 of 5, enhanced risk cover much of the rest of Ohio, Michigan and into parts of Indiana."
other,"Why Japan’s deadly Ontake eruption could not be predicted Mount Ontake, Japan’s second-highest volcano, erupted killing at least 31 people on September 27. Since then, there has been feverish speculation about why tourists were on an active volcano and why the eruption wasn’t predicted. Mount Ontake (also known as Ontakesan) is a stratovolcano which last erupted in 1979-80 and 2007 (there was also a possible, unconfirmed eruption in 1991). Before this, there were no recorded historical eruptions at Mount Ontake. Since the eruption in 1980, Ontake has been monitored by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). It has seismometers around the volcano to record volcanic tremors and instruments to measure any changes around the volcano. This would provide the JMA with signs that there was magma movement underneath the volcano and that perhaps an eruption was imminent. There had been a slight increase in volcanic tremors starting at the beginning of September. Why, then, was this eruption not predicted?"
earthquake,"A severe 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck off the east of New Zealand's North Island on Friday, prompting a tsunami warning, and authorities advised people in some coastal areas to move immediately to high ground.
There were no immediate reports of damage, but the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) said there was land and marine threat in some areas of the east coast of North Island.
""Coastal inundation (flooding of land areas) is expected in areas under Land and Marine threat,"" NEMA said in a tweet.
The closest major city to the epicentre is Gisborne with a population of about 35,500. People near the coast from Cape Runaway to Tolaga Bay were told to evacuate.
Authorities said the first waves may have already reached areas around East Cape from Cape Runaway to Tolaga Bay at about 3:34 a.m. local time.
They said tsunami activity will continue for several hours and the threat must be regarded as real until the warning is cancelled.
""Hope everyone is ok out there - especially on the East Coast who would have felt the full force of that earthquake,"" Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern posted on Instagram.
There was no tsunami threat to the capital Wellington and other regions, but civil defence authorities asked residents across the country to stay away from beaches and marine areas as there could be strong and unusual currents.
The New Zealand government's seismic monitor Geonet pegged the quake at a magnitude of 7.2 with a depth of 94 km (58 miles).
More than 60,000 people reported feeling the quake on GeoNet's website, with 282 describing the shaking as ""severe"" and 75 saying it was ""extreme"". Most others described it as light.
Aftershocks were still being recorded in the area."
wildfires,"California is in a state of emergency and two counties north of San Francisco were just declared a major federal disaster area as the Golden State endures its worst wildfire season in decades.
More than 9 million acres have burned so far in Western United States in what could shape up to be an all-time record year for fires.
At the same time, the wildfire season is growing longer than it was a few decades back, by as much as seven weeks in some areas. Earlier snowmelt in the West is contributing to this trend.
So why is the fire season this year worse than usual? The answer can be summed up with two words: It’s hot and dry.
And today, California, our most populous state, is the epicenter of the severe heat and crippling drought that are fueling the wildfires _ conditions scientists are increasingly linking to climate change."

The storm, packing sustained winds of up to 107 kilometers (67 miles) per hour, was moving in waters south of Japan, near the main southwestern island of Shikoku.
It had been downgraded from a typhoon earlier in the week. It was expected to hover eastward, affecting Honshu as well as smaller islands such as Izu by early Sunday.
The storm was not expected to seriously affect Tokyo or make direct landfall.
Weather forecasts warned of a heavy downpour and fierce winds, which may cause rivers to swell and towering waves in coastal areas as well as mudslides."
Typhoon,"A powerful typhoon has struck the Philippines, triggering floods and cutting power in the capital, Manila and throughout the main island, Luzon.
At least 16 people have been killed, including several children, most of them in Manila.
Typhoon Nesat also forced the closure of the Philippine Stock Exchange and the US embassy, and the ground floor of Manila's main hospital was flooded.
More than 100,000 people in Albay province were ordered to evacuate.
And thousands of residents of the capital flocked to school buildings for shelter - many carrying pets, TV sets, bags of clothes and other belongings.
However, caretaker Banny Domanais arrived at a school in the Marikina district with his wife and three daughters having left his possessions behind.
""We can replace things, but not people's lives,"" he said.

More than 26 per cent of the island is experiencing a severe drought and another 60 per cent is under a moderate drought, according to the US Drought Monitor.
From 3 July Puerto Rico's utilities company is strictly rationing nearly 140,000 clients water supply and they will be without water for 24 hours every other day.
The company has urged residents not to stockpile water and to maintain social distancing and wear masks if retrieving water from trucks on the island.
“We're asking people to please use moderation,” said Doriel Pagan, executive director of Puerto Rico's Water and Sewer Authority, adding that she could not say how long the rationing measures will last.
Gov Wanda Vazquez confirmed that 21 of 78 municipalities are affected by the severe drought while another 29 by the moderate drought.
Under the administrative order residents in most areas will be prohibited from excessive use of water such as watering gardens during daylight hours, filling pools, and using a hose or non-recycled water to wash cars.
Those who disregard the order face fines from 250 for residents to 2,500 for industries for a first violation."

On Sunday, Guatemala’s Volcán de Fuego — “Volcano of Fire” — erupted violently, spewing ash nearly four miles into the air and burying villages under an avalanche-like phenomenon called a pyroclastic flow. The disaster’s fatalities had risen to 62 by Monday afternoon, with hundreds more injured. The death toll is expected to climb, and the country’s disaster agency said 3,265 people had been evacuated. In the aftermath, some residents criticized local authorities, asking why there was no advance warning and why officials waited so long to tell them to leave. The 12,000-foot “Volcano of Fire” has been erupting on and off since 2002, and Guatemala has a national institute — INSIVUMEH — committed to actively monitoring the country’s volcanoes. The PBS NewsHour spoke with a panel of volcanologists about why this eruption was so devastating. They said despite the destruction so far, the worst may be yet to come."
drought,"In some areas of Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia and Uganda, drought conditions are the worst in 60 years, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in an update.
Almost half the of children arriving in refugees camps in Ethiopia from southern Somalia are malnourished, while 11 districts in Kenya have reported malnutrition rates above the 15 per cent emergency threshold. Supplementary and therapeutic feeding programmes are struggling to keep pace with the rising needs, according to OCHA.
Drought-related displacement and refugee flows are on the rise, with an average of 15,000 Somalis arriving in Kenya and Ethiopia every month this year seeking assistance.
“While conflict has been a fact of life for them for years, it is the drought that has taken them to breaking point. Many have walked for days, are exhausted, in poor health, desperate for food and water, and arriving in a worse condition than usual,” according to the OCHA update on the drought situation in the region.
The influx of Somalis into refugee camps in the Dadaab area of Kenya’s North-Eastern province _ the largest refugee settlement in the world _ has led to worsening overcrowding amid limited resources.
The drought has forced children out of school as both human and livestock diseases spread. Competition for the meagre resources is causing tensions among communities.
The price of grain in drought-affected areas of Kenya is 30 to 80 per cent more than the five-year average, according to OCHA, while in Ethiopia, the consumer price index for food increased by almost 41 per cent last month. Further food price hikes area expected in Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda and Somalia, but could ease after the next harvests expected later this year.
OCHA called for the scaling up of the emergency response in all affected areas, urging governments, donors and relief agencies step up efforts to prevent further deterioration.
Further funding is also required to enable humanitarian agencies to provide the necessary assistance. UN agencies and the partners this year requested 529 million for Somalia, but only 50 per cent of that amount has been received.
In Kenya, where 525 million is required, about 54 per cent of that money has been obtained so far. The appeal for Djibouti is for 39 million, but only 30 per cent has been received."

The quake centered just east across the border in neighboring Iran, west of the Iranian city of Khoy, and affected villages in the Turkish province of Van. At least three of the dead were children, according to Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu. The health minister later said at least 37 people were injured, including nine in critical but not life-threatening condition. Iran’s official IRNA news agency said at least 75 people had been injured inside Iran, six of whom were hospitalized. A second earthquake — also magnitude 5.7 — struck Sunday evening in the same area in Iran, according to the country's seismology center. It was not immediately clear if the second quake caused further damage or casualties in either country. The U.S. Geological Survey put the second earthquake’s magnitude at 6.0. Varying magnitudes are common in the immediate aftermath. Turkish broadcaster NTV showed images of locals and soldiers digging through the rubble of collapsed buildings on Sunday, as families sat in snowy streets fearing further tremors. Emergency teams were sent to the remote mountainous region, which has a history of powerful earthquakes. Last month, a quake centered on the eastern Turkish city of Elazig killed more than 40 people. In 2011, more than 600 were killed when a quake struck north of Van province's capital."

Circular dry plough tracks resemble the concentric circles in Aboriginal dot paintings that tell of an ancient mythology, starving cattle queuing for feed look like an abstract painting, and their black shadows stretching across the land a surrealist image.
But for farmer Ash Whitney there is no such beauty, just blood, sweat and tears as he struggles to feed his cattle, cutting the drying branches of Kurrajong trees _ a last resort during the worst of droughts.
“I have been here all my life, and this drought is feeling like it will be around a while,” says a despairing Whitney, whose property near the town of Gunnedah is on the Liverpool Plains _ a usually fertile area now withered, having received the lowest average rainfall in nearly 30 years.
The worst drought in living memory is sweeping parts of eastern Australia, leaving farmers struggling to cope and asking questions about the future.
Cattle farmer Tom Wollaston, born 70 years ago in the same house he lives in today, is afraid for what this drought will mean for his children, who aim to takeover the 2,300 hectare (5,683 acre) property when Tom “hangs up his boots”.
“I can't seem to be able to do anything else apart from just feed, and keep things going. The drought seems to be one step ahead of me all the time. We'll battle it out, but it puts a strain on everyone,” says Wollaston.
His wife Margo says droughts have a very negative impact, not only on her family but on the whole farming community around the nearby town of Tamworth in northwest New South Wales (NSW) state.
“I find droughts a little bit like cancer _ it sort of eats away at you, and it just gets drier and drier and more severe and more severe, and impacting on your life a lot worse. I do try really hard to keep the house and the garden clean and green because that keeps your head in the right space at night time”.
May McKeown, 79, and her son Jimmie live on a property near the northwest NSW town of Walgett and say they are extremely worried about the future, having had almost no rain since 2010.
“My great grandfather settled on this land in 1901, and he never had to remove cattle from the paddocks over there,” she says pointing to the west. “But we have had to remove them all and bring them closer to the homestead so we can more easily feed them.”"

wildfires,"A wildfire in the Mark Twain National Forest just west of the Bixby/Viburnum area was 40 percent contained as of 4 p.m. Friday afternoon. The fire has already consumed more than 450 acres according to the U.S. Forest Service.
The fire was called in at about 10:15 a.m. Thursday and fire fighters arrived on the scene by 11 a.m. Additional fire departments were called to help battle the blaze, which started at the intersection of Iron County Road 73 and Highway 32. The fire continued to move east on Highway 32 throughout the night and into Friday morning.
Increased winds from the southeast pushed the fire over Highway 32 where another section of land, just west of Council Bluff Lake, was devastated, forcing the highway’s closure. It has been closed from highway 49 south to Route A.
Council Bluffs campground is still open as of press time, but may be difficult to get to, and the campground could be closed if it becomes necessary.
""What is really driving this fire is low humidity and high temperatures. This creates a situation where the fire is actually pushing itself. It is essentially creating its own wind. This is a situation we see often out west, such as in the Colorado Fires, but not usually in Missouri,"" said Susan Zornek-Stevens, U.S Forest Service Public Information Officer.
There were some residential structures within a mile of the fire, but no residents had been evacuated as of press time. Officials say they will take that precaution if the fire spreads any closer to those homes.
Jody Eberly with the Mark Twain National Forest said things are so dry, the fires are getting into the tops of the trees as well.
She is cautioning people to be extra careful. With conditions this dry, even throwing a cigarette out of a car window or on the ground from the sidewalk can quickly start a large fire that could endanger many homes and lives.
At press time officials have not determined the exact nature of the blaze, but say it was likely set by a careless motorist. The Forest Service implores residents to be cautious during these severe drought conditions."
drought,"California is at the edge of another protracted drought, just a few years after one of the worst dry spells in state history left poor and rural communities without well water, triggered major water restrictions in cities, forced farmers to idle their fields, killed millions of trees, and fueled devastating megafires.
On Thursday, the unofficial end of California’s wet season, officials announced that the accumulation of snow in the Sierra Nevada mountains and the Cascades was about 40% below average levels. The state doesn’t have enough snow and rain banked to replenish its groundwater supplies, feed its rivers and streams or fill depleted reservoirs.
“It’s not just that we’re anticipating a dry year, it’s that this is our second extremely dry year, in a row,” said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California Los Angeles and the Nature Conservancy. California _ along with much of the US west _ is parched, Swain added, and should brace for water cuts and arid conditions that could trigger more destructive wildfires.
Just four years since the state’s last drought emergency, experts and advocates say the state isn’t ready to cope with what could be months and possibly years of drought to come. Heading into the summer, battles are heating up between cities, farms and environmentalists over how scarce supplies are rationed."
wildfires,"Towns on the devastated Tasman Peninsula in the state's south-east are cut off and only accessible via sea.
Meanwhile, a fire emergency warning has been issued between Inala Road at Forcett and the Tasman Peninsula.
The Tasmania Fire Service (TFS) says the out-of-control blaze has spread south of Murdunna and has active fire edges back to Forcett and Dodges Ferry.
The service says Taranna is currently being affected by the fire and it is too late for residents to leave the town.
It is understood a number of properties near Eaglehawk Neck have been lost.
The peninsula remains cut off with the Arthur Highway closed until further notice.
Phil Douglas from the TFS says people need to keep off the highway near the Forcett and Nubeena areas.
""There is a strong potential for trees and power lines to fall across those roads at any time without any warming,"" he said.
An emergency warning has also been issued for the Bicheno area in the state's east, where a 4,000-hectare fire is burning out of control.
Firefighters warned the communities of Friendly Beaches and Bicheno may be affected by smoke, embers and ash.
They said Coles Bay Road, south of the Apsley River, and the Tasman Highway, south of Tower Hill, were at very high fire risk.
Coles Bay Road has been closed in both directions, cutting road access to Coles Bay on the Freycinet Peninsula.
The TFS says it is likely too late for residents to leave the affected area, with residents urged to activate their bushfire plans and defend their homes or leave, but only if the path is clear.
There is a community fire refuge for Bicheno residents at Bicheno Community Hall and another for Coles Bay and Swanwick residents at the Swansea Football Ground."
earthquake,"7.1-magnitude offshore earthquake rattles southern Philippines, no tsunami warning issued MANILA, Jan. 21 (Xinhua) -- An offshore earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 7.1 jolted Davao Occidental province in the southern Philippines on Thursday, the Philippine Institute of Seismology and Volcanology (Phivolcs) said. The institute said the quake, which struck at 8:23 p.m. local time, hit at a depth of 116 km, about 231 km southeast of Jose Abad Santos town. The institute said the quake will trigger aftershocks but will not cause damage. The tremor was also felt in General Santos City, Davao City and Bislig City in Surigao del Sur province, it added. Phivolcs said no tsunami warning was issued following the quake. ""There is no tsunami threat to the Philippines from the quake,"" the institute said. The Philippines has frequent seismic activity due to its location along the Pacific ""Ring of Fire."" Enditem"
Typhoon,"A powerful typhoon has hit South Korea with strong winds and heavy rain, killing nine and churning up rough seas that smashed two Chinese fishing ships into rocks and forced the coast guard to perform a daring rescue of survivors.
Rescuers saved 12 fishermen and searched for 10 still missing from the ships that hit rocks off South Korea's southern Jeju island. Five fishermen were killed, officials said.
Separately, at least four other people died as Typhoon Bolaven knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of South Koreans, cancelled flights and temporarily halted joint war games by U.S. and South Korean military forces.
North Korea, which is still struggling to rebuild from massive floods and a devastating drought before that, was next in the typhoon's path. State media reported the country was being lashed by heavy rain and strong wind on Tuesday.
Off Jeju island, dangerous waves kept rescue vessels from approaching the Chinese fishing ships. The coast guard used a special gun to shoot rope to one ship so officers could pull themselves over and bring the fishermen back to shore, coast guard spokesman Ko Chang-keon said.
Eighteen fishermen survived. Twelve were rescued by the coast guard and the others swam or were washed ashore.
South Korea issued a storm warning for the capital, Seoul, as Bolaven battered the country's south and west, knocking over street lights and church spires and ripping signs from stores. A large container box crushed an apartment janitor to death, a woman fell to her death from a rooftop where she kept dried red peppers and a third person died after bricks hit a house, according to disaster and fire officials.
Strong wind gusts left Seoul streets covered with leaves, garbage and branches. More than 15,000 schools cancelled classes, and businesses and homes taped windows or pasted the glass with wet newspapers to keep them from shattering.
More than 330,000 South Korean households lost power, the government said, and more than 70 were left homeless because of floods or storm damage. Nearly 200 flights were cancelled."
drought,"In the cattle town of Emory in East Texas, the worst drought in state history is threatening a way of life. Scorching temperatures and a lack of rain have forced many ranchers to sell off their stock.
Normally before being brought to market, cattle are penned in a rancher's best pasture to be fattened. The heavier the cow, the more the buyer pays.
But the animals at a recent Emory auction look pitiful. They're standing in 107-degree heat — that's in the shade — with their ribs showing, stressed out. It's been like this for the past nine weeks — no rain. Although these cows were bred for the heat, they weren't bred for this. They look absolutely baked.
If this were a normal year, an August cattle auction in Emory would see maybe 100 to 200 head. There are more than 700 head today. And that's down from the more than 1,000 head sold here every Tuesday for much of this summer. The sad truth is, East Texas is starting to run out of stock to sell.
Inside the auction room, buyers in jeans and cowboy hats, here from Michigan and Wisconsin, Tennessee and Alabama, raise their fingers in front of their chests to bid. One cow, one calf, one bull after another, until late into the night. The Lone Star State is emptying itself of its cattle.
Stanley Austin is a rancher and a commission-order buyer, which means he buys livestock for farmers and feed yards. He has seen the drought's effects up close, at his family's ranch.
""We've had that place in our family for 75 years,"" he says, ""and it's never been without water. It's been without water now since about the 15th of June.""
Austin travels throughout Texas, going to seven livestock sales each week. He says the drought is going to alter the state's rural economies forever."
wildfires,"Wildfires continue to rage in Texas as extremely dry and windy conditions have turned the entire state into a giant tinder box where the smallest spark can set acres ablaze.
To date over a million acres have been affected and Texas Governor Rick Perry is requesting Major Disaster Declaration for the state of Texas as a result of the continuing wildfire dangers. In a letter sent to President Barack Obama over the weekend, the governor identified 252 Texas counties presently threatened or impacted by wildfires.
Since wildfire season began, Texas fire officials have responded to 7,807 fires across the state that have burned more than 1,528,714 acres and destroyed 244 homes. One firefighter has died and 18 others injured.
Near Strawn Texas, rancher Joel Stephens says fires have so far burned 1,200 acres of his family's ranch, but they've been lucky since nearly all their livestock are accounted for and the fire did not burn their house, hay or barns. There's still a threat though as winds switch direction. Stephens, who is also a firefighter, is prepared to take steps to save the home and barns should the fire start moving back.
He says the landscape around there resembles what you see with tornadoes. Some homes are devastated while others are intact almost like an oasis in the desert.
In some areas, town officials are packing up essential documents and closing courthouses as fires move closer. And homes in the fires path are being evacuated in order to save lives.
Firefighters from all over have moved into help control the blazes. ""When the fires first started, we had local firefighters, but now there are firefighters helping battle the blazes from other areas,"" says Stephens. And earlier this week the Texas Forest Service ordered additional aerial resources to help battle the wildfires
As Stephens was talking on the phone, he was watching fires blaze up again and moving with the changing wind directions. His ranch is still in danger, and unfortunately, the weather doesn't look like it will be changing anytime soon. But hopefully some unexpected showers will pop up soon and the winds will die down to help slow the movement of these fires."

drought,"Chile has been hit by its worst drought in six decades, forcing officials to declare an agricultural emergency to prevent the collapse of farming. 
The country's capital Santiago and its outskirts, as well as Coquimbo, Valparaiso and O'Higgins, are among the worst-hit areas.
The emergency status, impacting almost half the country, will see relief measures fast-tracked for the agriculture industry, including drinking water and medicine for animals.
In some areas, water for human consumption has become scarce.
Cattle are collapsing where they stand and reducing to skeletons in the baking heat, and boats have been left abandoned in dried-out marinas.
""We are talking about a process of desertification rather than a temporary drought or absence of rain problem. We are talking about a tendency that has come to stay,"" Felipe Machado, director of the country's resilience institute.
This year has been one of the driest years Chile has experienced in sixty years, according to agriculture minister Antonio Walker."
drought,"A severe drought has left about 793,333 hectares of crops affected in northern China's Hebei Province, the provincial department of water resources said Friday.
According to the department, 15,700 people have difficulties accessing drinking water, while 3,000 domestic animals are also facing a water shortage.
The province has seen less rainfall since June, with average precipitation standing at 37 mm, about 55 percent lower than the same period in previous years.
To fight the drought, Hebei will carry out drought-resistant projects such as building pools, water cellars and pumping wells. It will also mobilize the public to transport water to guarantee basic living needs of the affected people and livestock and ensure water supply for the industrial and agricultural use in the province."
other,"Caribbean island tackles water, food shortages after volcano eruption The tiny eastern Caribbean island of Saint Vincent was rocked by a fifth day of eruptions from the La Soufriere volcano on Tuesday as leaders warned of shortages of water and the potential need for hundreds of millions of dollars to rebuild. The explosion happened around 6 a.m., causing another billowing plume of smoke and ash as well as pyroclastic currents of ash and rock hurtling down the volcano's flanks. Officials have warned it could continue to be active for months. Ash blankets much of the island, as thick as 8 inches (20 cm) in some parts. It has destroyed crops, contaminated water, killed animals and devastated infrastructure, also rendering some roads impassable, complicating search and rescue efforts."
wildfires,"A Washington man’s cement home is still standing after surviving a raging wildfire that passed his home and scorched acres of surrounding land.
John Belles said he was prepared for the inevitability of a wildfire when he built his thin-shelled, concrete dome in 1999 surrounded by dry fields in Okanogan County.
Earlier this week, Belles just happened to be working 30 miles out of town when he received a voicemail from a friend warning him about a fire approaching his home, he told ABC News today.
After shuttling three vehicles off his property, Belles said he realized he had to hurry as the fire was only a couple hundred yards away.
“The fire was getting close, in fact, there was a firefighter there at the time who got trapped inside when I shut the gate inadvertently,” Belles said.
“I grabbed the hose, soaked my clothing down and doused the north side of the building as much as I could. [The fire] got close enough that it was super heated and getting uncomfortable out there in the smoke. I went inside, shut the door behind me and watched it move by.”
Belles said he waited out the flames for about a minute as the fire passed by his home."
Typhoon,"Tropical Storm Arthur Could Develop Off The East Coast This Weekend — 2 Weeks Before Hurricane Season Starts TOPLINE The National Hurricane Center says there is a 70% chance in the next five days, and a 40% chance in the next 48 hours, that the first official system in this year’s Atlantic hurricane season could develop off the U.S. East Coast — a full two weeks before the official start of a hurricane season forecasters show could be one of the most active in history. Clouds and thunderstorms currently moving between the Florida Keys and Cuba are “likely” to develop into a tropical or subtropical depression this weekend in the Atlantic Ocean and then move northeastward, according to the National Hurricane Center, though it is too early to tell exactly what the full impact could be on the East Coast. Should the system develop and sustained winds reach at least 39 mph, it would be given the name Arthur. The Atlantic hurricane season doesn’t officially start until June 1."
wildfires,"An out-of-control wildfire burning northeast of the Australian west coast city of Perth has destroyed at least 59 homes and was threatening more Tuesday, with many residents across the region told it is too late to leave.
The 7,000-hectare (17,000-acre) blaze, which has a 80-kilometer (50-mile) perimeter, began on Monday and raged through the night near the town of Wooroloo, with the shires of Mundaring, Chittering, Northam, and the city of Swan affected.
“Firefighters have done a remarkable job in some of the most challenging conditions that we’ve experienced in the metropolitan region for some time,” Western Australia state Department of Fire and Emergency Services Commissioner Darren Klemm said.
“Tragically, 59 properties have been lost in this fire and that number may increase as we continue to assess the extent of the damage,” Klemm added.
Six firefighters sustained minor injuries, Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported. No other injuries were reported.
The fire doubled in size overnight and burned through 7,366 hectares (18,202 acres) of farm and woodland, officials said.
State Premier Mark McGowan said 80% of all properties at Tilden Park near Gidgegannup on Perth’s northeast rural fringe have been lost.
McGowan said a large aerial tanker was flying from the Australian east coast to help fight the blaze.
“This is an extremely dangerous fire and a serious situation. Weather conditions are extremely volatile,” McGowan said.
“Please do everything you can to keep you and your family safe and look after each other,” he added.
People in a 25-kilometer (16-mile) stretch west from Wooroloo to the Walyunga National Park northeast of Perth were told Tuesday it had become too dangerous to leave their homes."
earthquake,"(CNN)New Zealand has downgraded its tsunami warning after a powerful earthquake struck the Kermadec Islands region early Friday, sparking fears of a tsunami.
The 8.1-magnitude quake was the third to strike the area on Friday morning local time, according to the New Zealand National Emergency Management Agency.
Residents in some areas received emergency alerts on their phones urging them to ""EVACUATE NOW,"" as tsunami sirens rang out. The emergency agency issued a temporary evacuation order for people near the coast, warning them, ""Do not stay at home"" as a ""damaging tsunami is possible.""
The Kermadec Islands are 500 to 620 miles northeast of New Zealand's North Island. The East Coast of the North Island from the Bay of Islands to Whangarei, from Matata to Tolaga Bay including Whakatane and Opotiki and Great Barrier Island are all included in the Pacific nation's tsunami warning."

Yet to more than 5,000 people the Taal Volcano is home. A lush island dotted with dozens of craters in the middle of a shimmering lake, the volcano roared into action Sunday with a mighty eruption that shot rocks, ash and steam miles into the sky just hours after the inhabitants of its four villages fled on a flotilla of boats. A man who defied official warnings about the ongoing eruption to sneak back to the island to check on his pigs, says there is complete devastation."
earthquake,"A ferocious tsunami spawned by one of the largest earthquakes ever recorded slammed Japan’s eastern coast Friday, killing hundreds of people as it swept away boats, cars and homes while widespread fires burned out of control.
Hours later, the tsunami hit Hawaii and warnings blanketed the Pacific, putting areas on alert as far away as South America, Canada, Alaska and the entire U.S. West Coast. In Japan, the area around a nuclear power plant in the northeast was evacuated after the reactor’s cooling system failed.
Police said 200 to 300 bodies were found in the northeastern coastal city of Sendai, the city in Miyagi prefecture (state) closest to the quake’s epicenter. Another 88 were confirmed killed and at least 349 were missing. The death toll was likely to continue climbing given the scale of the disaster.
The magnitude-8.9 offshore quake unleashed a 23-foot (seven-meter) tsunami and was followed by more than 50 aftershocks for hours, many of them of more than magnitude 6.0.
Dozens of cities and villages along a 1,300-mile (2,100-kilometer) stretch of coastline were shaken by violent tremors that reached as far away as Tokyo, hundreds of miles (kilometers) from the epicenter. A large section of Kesennuma, a town of 70,000 people in Miyagi, burned furiously into the night with no apparent hope of the flames being extinguished, public broadcaster NHK said."
drought,"A historic drought in Chennai, the sixth-largest city in India, is so severe that it’s now visible from space.
The city’s 4.6 million citizens are rationing every drop of water, restaurants are closing early and companies are scaling back their operations as Chennai tries to survive a heat wave with 99 per cent less water than it had at the same time last year. The state government is shipping in water on trucks, but those trucks can’t replace the now dried-up lakes that once fed the city.
Everyone is asking the same question: When will the monsoons start?
Satellite footage released earlier this month shows the city’s four reservoirs, including nearby Lake Puzhal, have severely shrunk since last June. The reservoirs have a capacity of 318.8 billion litres, but they are down to a collective 651 million litres, according to government data reported by the Hindustan Times. The reservoirs have been reduced to 0.2 per cent of their capacity, according to state government data.
The city typically relies on the heavy rainfall of monsoon season to replenish its water supply, which comes from four lakes and groundwater reservoirs in the region. The monsoons usually start in June but they’ve been delayed this year, leaving citizens with little water amid blistering temperatures that exceed 40 C each day.
The problem dates back to last year, when Chennai saw a major shortfall in its monthly rainfall. The city received 80 per cent less rain than average in December alone, according to India’s weather office.
Temperatures in Chennai typically peak in May and June, around the same time that rainfall starts picking up. February, March and April are typically drought season, while the heaviest monsoon rains come in October, November and December.
The city has struggled to meet its water needs for the last few years. A government think tank warned last year that Chennai is one of 21 Indian cities that could run out of groundwater by 2020."

The follow-up to her 2019 debut When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?, it addresses the pressures of fame, as well as weighty issues facing young women, including sexual coercion.
Reviewers said the record is ""defiant"" despite its ""muted"" tone.
The Guardian's Alexis Petridis gave the ""universally great"" album four stars.
He said that ""on perhaps the most anticipated album of 2021, Eilish uses subdued yet powerful song writing to consider how fame has seeped into every corner of her life.
""Listening to a pop star complaining about being a pop star is usually enervating. It says something about Eilish's skill as a song writer that, in her hands, the topic feels genuinely affecting.""
This is partly, he wrote, because despite her stratospheric success, Eilish continues to express her fears with relatable intimacy as pop's anti-hero."
