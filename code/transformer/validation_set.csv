earthquake,"A magnitude 5.9 earthquake has struck southwestern Iran along the Persian Gulf.
There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries from the temblor Sunday.
Iranian state television alerted on its broadcast, saying it was a 5.9 magnitude. A second aftershock quake of 4.5 magnitude followed it.
The US Geological Survey called it a 5.8 magnitude earthquake, located at the port city of Bandar Genaveh. It described its depth at 10 kilometers (6.2 miles).
A magnitude 5 earthquake can cause considerable damage. Such shallow earthquakes as Sunday's also have broader damage.
That's some 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant.
Iran is on major seismic faults and experiences one earthquake a day on average. In 2003, a magnitude 6.6 earthquake flattened the historic city of Bam, killing 26,000 people.
A magnitude 7 earthquake that struck western Iran in 2017 killed more than 600 people and injured more than 9,000."
Typhoon,"Trump sends questionable tweet on Tropical Storm Fay’s threat to New Hampshire The day after the Commerce Department inspector general released the results of an investigation into President Trump’s inaccurate statements regarding Hurricane Dorian last September, Trump sent a problematic tweet about the path of Tropical Storm Fay. The tweet, posted just after 1 p.m. Friday, said that the storm, making landfall in New Jersey, was headed toward the “Great State of New Hamphire,” justifying the rescheduling of a campaign rally on Saturday evening in Portsmouth. Yet the National Hurricane Center only included the very western fringe of the state in its predicted zone of where the storm center might pass, nowhere in the vicinity of Portsmouth. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters Friday that the campaign rally was being delayed due to a “big storm” expected in Portsmouth, when forecasts from the National Weather Service showed just periodic showers and light winds likely tapering off by evening. The National Weather Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the forecast information provided by Trump and McEnany."
drought,"It's one of the most overlooked disasters in the world. In Madagascar, 1.5 million people are suffering from a serious food crisis and need emergency assistance. Several dozen people have already died of hunger. An unprecedented drought, which hit the south of the island in recent years and destroyed almost all of the crops, is mostly to blame. As the UN World Food Programme asks for emergency aid of 62.45 million, our correspondent Ga?lle Borgia travelled to Anosy, the region hardest hit by the crisis.
For the past six months in Madagascar, men, women, the elderly and children have been dying of hunger. However, although the World Food Programme (WFP) has requested 62.45 million from donor countries, the Malagasy government remains largely indifferent to the crisis and has refused to declare a state of emergency.
The region of Anosy, in the far south of Madagascar, has been particularly hard hit by the unprecedented drought. It is also one of the most remote and dangerous areas of the island.
The district of Amboasary Atsimo, from where we reported, is often the scene of attacks from ""dahalo"" _ rural bandits who carry out raids in villages and kill."
earthquake,"A magnitude 5.6 earthquake struck southwest Iran near the town of Sisakht on Wednesday evening and at least 10 people were injured, state television said.
""People in Sisakht and the town of Yasuj left their homes in panic. Water and electricity have been cut off in Sisakht,"" a local official in the province of Kohgiluyeh and Boyer Ahmad told the TV.
""Rescue teams and ambulances have been dispatched to the area...So far 10 people have been injured.""
The state news agency IRNA said the quake, felt in several cities and towns in the region, struck at a depth of 10 km (6 miles) at 10:05 p.m. local time (1835 GMT).
""There are still no reports of fatalities,"" IRNA said.
Iran is crisscrossed by major geological fault lines and has suffered several devastating earthquakes in recent years."
other,"A Hong Kong man has been sentenced to nine years in prison after he rode a motorbike into police officers while flying a flag with a protest slogan.
Tong Ying-kit, whose flag bore the phrase ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times"", was earlier found guilty of inciting secession and terrorism.
He was the first person to be charged under Hong Kong's controversial national security law.
Friday's verdict has set the tone for how future cases might be interpreted.
More than 100 people have been arrested since the law came into force in 2020.
Critics say it reduces Hong Kong's autonomy and makes it easier to punish activists. But Beijing insists that the law is needed to bring stability to the city.
""We consider that this overall term should sufficiently reflect the defendant's culpability in the two offences and the abhorrence of society, at the same time, achieving the deterrent effect required,"" the judges who presided over the case said in a written judgement, according to Reuters.
Tong's conviction for secession was because of the slogan on his flag, with police adding that he was guilty of terrorist activities as his actions were a ""deliberate challenge against the police""."
wildfires,"One of the state’s worst wildfire seasons in history has scorched 5 million acres of tundra and forests across Alaska, and experts here fear climate change will cause even more devastating fires through a combination of lower snowpack, drying tundra and melting permafrost.
Like an insulating blanket, snow reduces fire risk by keeping trees and grasses cold and damp. If less snow accumulates, or worse, snow covers less of the state than normal, there will be nothing to stop the near-constant summer sun from drying out the tundra and the permafrost layer below it. Permafrost, which is mostly composed of organic material, burns easily once thawed and lightning strikes.
Anchorage, for example, had its least snowy winter on record, with just over two feet of snow, the National Weather Service reported.
“We’re looking at, potentially over time, more fires burning more area,” said Kent Slaughter, the manager of the federal Bureau of Land Management’s Alaska Fire Service.
From the U.S. Army’s Fort Wainwright, Slaughter commands an army of firefighters, smokejumpers, logistics experts, pilots and supply clerks to coordinate battles most residents of the Lower 48 don't know are even happening. At the height of the fire season in early July, Slaughter and his teams were battling two wildfires that were each nearly three times bigger than any blaze in the rest of the country."
Typhoon,"Just three weeks after a powerful earthquake shook the central area of the Philippines, the country has been hit by on of the most dangerous storms ever recorded. Typhoon Haiyan, known locally as Yolanda, made landfall on Friday with winds of around 300km/h and the diameter of up to 400 km, causing heavy rainfalls, flash floods and landslides. Despite preparedness measures taken by the national authorities devastation is vast, millions of people have been affected and the death toll is expected to be substantial. A team of ECHO humanitarian experts has been deployed on the ground and is conducting a rapid needs assessment with partner organisations. The European Commission stands ready to assist.
The Emergency Response and Coordination Centre (ERCC) of the European Commission's Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department ECHO is closely monitoring the situation. Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) reached the equivalent of a Hurricane Category 5 during its quick passage through the archipelago and is now heading towards Vietnam. Nearly 800 000 residents on the potentially affected areas were pre-emptively evacuated, including survivors of the island communities struck by the 7.2 magnitude earthquake on 15 October, who were staying in tent shelters, but humanitarian impact has nevertheless been high. Access to affected areas remains difficult, with power and telecommunications shutdowns in most of them as well.
The Philippines is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world, with 15 to 20 cyclones a year and major seismic upheavals, among other natural catastrophes. The European Commission has provided _42.7 million in disaster relief since 1997 and almost _8 million in preparedness. In 2013 alone, _2.5 million were made available for the response to the earthquake in Bohol, a total of _10 million were released to help rebuild the communities stricken in December 2012 by Typhoon Bopha (Pablo), and following flooding caused by Typhoon Trami (Maring) in August ECHO committed _200 000 to assist those affected."
earthquake,"'It was a pretty good shaker': 7.5 magnitude earthquake in Pacific Ocean prompts short-lived tsunami scare for Alaska, Hawaii A magnitude 7.5 earthquake jolted Alaska's southern coast on Monday afternoon, triggering a tsunami warning for The Last Frontier and a short-lived tsunami advisory nearly 2,500 miles away in Hawaii. The quake struck in the North Pacific Ocean just before 1 p.m., about 67 miles southeast of Sand Point, a town of about 900 people off the Alaskan Peninsula, according to the Alaska Earthquake Center. The tsunami warning was downgraded about two hours later to an advisory that stretched until about 9 p.m. before being canceled. “It was a pretty good shaker here,” said David Adams, co-manager of Marine View Bed and Breakfast in Sand Point. “You could see the water kind of shaking and shimmering during the quake."" A magnitude 5.2 quake was reported 11 minutes later in roughly the same area, according to the earthquake center. Wave levels reached 2 feet along Alaska's southern coast, according to the National Tsunami Warning Center."
Typhoon,"Typhoon Molave slammed into Vietnam with destructive force Wednesday, killing at least two people and sinking two fishing boats with 26 crew members in what was feared to be the most powerful storm to hit the country in 20 years.
Winds of up to 150 kilometers (93 miles) per hour killed a man by knocking him off his roof as he was trying to reinforce it in south-central Quang Ngai province. Another man was pinned to death by a fallen tree in the coastal province, the official Vietnam News Agency reported.
The navy deployed two rescue boats to search for the 26 fishermen off Binh Dinh province, according to state-run VTV network. It was not immediately clear if anyone was saved in the storm-tossed waters."
earthquake,"An earthquake measuring a preliminary magnitude of 6.0 struck Thursday in waters off the south coast of Panama, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
The quake was recorded around 9:42 GMT Thursday at a depth of 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) under the northern Pacific Ocean, some 150 kilometers (93 miles) southeast of Punta de Burica, Panama.
The USGS said little or no population was exposed to the quake. No tsunami warning has been issued.
No other details were immediately available."
Typhoon,"Tropical Storm Bertha forms off the South Carolina coast A tropical storm warning has been issued for South Carolina’s coast and the storm was expected to bring heavy rainfall, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. Tropical Storm Bertha formed Wednesday morning off the coast of South Carolina, becoming the second named storm before the official start of this year's Atlantic hurricane season. A tropical storm warning has been issued for South Carolina's coast and the storm was expected to bring heavy rainfall, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. Bertha’s maximum sustained winds were near 45 mph (75 kph) but it was expected to weaken to a tropical depression after moving inland. The storm was centered about 30 miles (50 kilometers) east-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina, and was moving northwest near 9 mph (15 kph)."
earthquake,"Magnitude-6.9 earthquake strikes Papua New Guinea Tsunami alert issued following tremor An magnitude-6.9 earthquake hit near Lae, Papua New Guinea, and a tsunami alert was issued Friday, according to Radio New Zealand. The epicenter was located in Wau village near Lae, and the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued a tidal wave warning for Papua New Guinea shores. The US Geological Research Center said the quake occurred 85 kilometers (52 miles) below the surface. Officials are yet to make a statement on casualties and property damage."

Plumes of volcanic gas and ash overtook the fleeing hikers and buried nearby lodges and outbuildings. Though most of the people on Mount Ontake that day were able to escape. 40 suffered significant injuries and at least 36 bodies have been found so far, according to Japanese authorities. More than 24 bodies remain at the summit, and recovery crews have been unable to return, wary of more activity from Ontake as tremors continue to shake the region."
Typhoon,"Edouard formed in the Atlantic, but it isn't the tropical system the US should watch (CNN)Tropical Storm Edouard formed in the Atlantic on Sunday night with sustained winds of 40 mph. ""The center of the Edouard is located a little over 500 miles south of Newfoundland,"" CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen says. It is forecast to turn into a post-tropical system later Monday or Monday night and is expected to continue to track toward Ireland and the UK. If it stays together, it could impact these countries later in the week. But the tropical system people in the US should keep their eyes on is moving across the Southeast on Monday. This system moved from the Gulf of Mexico on Sunday and drifted over the Florida Panhandle and into Georgia Monday. Once the low-pressure system emerges back into the Atlantic off the Carolina coasts, it could become our next named storm."
Typhoon,"Typhoon Wipha, which is currently a storm with 110 mph winds located several hundred miles south of Kyoto, Japan, appears poised to sideswipe, or possibly even make a direct hit on Japan in the coming days. The storm is expected to bring strong winds, heavy rain, and high waves to the Japanese coast from Tokyo northward, including the ailing Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, where cleanup efforts have already hit serious roadblocks.
Current forecasts show Wipha making landfall, or coming close to making landfall, near Tokyo on Tuesday into Wednesday, while transitioning from a weakening tropical cyclone into a hybrid storm, with characteristics of both a tropical storm and an extratropical system. Those characteristics are similar to some of the features that Hurricane Sandy had when it devastated the U.S. East Coast nearly a year ago this month. Wipha could bring an expanded area of high winds and pounding surf along with several inches of rain to heavily populated areas of Japan, including the vulnerable nuclear plant that was incapacitated by the massive earthquake and tsunami in 2011. The tsunami led to a series of cascading engineering failures, culminating in a triple nuclear meltdown at the plant in the worst accident at a nuclear power plant since Chernobyl in 1986.
Ryan Maue, a meteorologist at WeatherBell Analytics, a private forecasting firm, told Climate Central that the storm poses a “huge flood potential” for the Fukushima area. “Deep convection on the westward flank of the storm . . . plus the topography of Japan means heavy rain for the coastline regardless of the Typhoon's track,” he said in an email message. “Wipha is extra-large size-wise,” Maue said, predicting it will grow and strengthen as it makes its closest pass to Japan, aided by strong jet stream winds in the upper atmosphere.
Even in the absence of landfalling typhoons, cleanup work at Fukushima has hit numerous serious roadblocks, with recent discoveries that the plant has been leaking radioactive water into the Pacific Ocean. A team of 16 experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency is currently in Japan to visit the plant and advise the Japanese government on how to deal with the challenge of storing large amounts of radioactive material on site."
other,"Former patients and children of a Canadian fertility doctor who used his own or unknown sperm to impregnate patients have been offered a C$13m ($10m, £7m) settlement agreement.
It is thought to be the first-ever legal settlement of its kind.
Under the terms of the deal, claimants will be given compensation based on court-determined level of harm.
Money will also be set aside for a DNA database to allow dozens of children to identify their biological fathers.
The class-action lawsuit currently includes 226 people. Dr Barwin worked at two clinics in Ottawa, Ontario.
Some couples who were told that the male partner's sperm would be used were unknowingly given random samples, and in some cases, the doctor's own.
Some of the claims date back to the 1970s. Dr Barwin is now in his 80s and has not practiced since 2014.
The settlement must still be approved by a judge before any money will be made available.
Rebecca Dixon, 31, found out that her real father was Dr Barwin - whose clinic her parents had visited - after she developed a disease that nobody else in her family had. She and her parents launched the lawsuit in 2016.
""I am not sure we will ever achieve closure,"" she told the Ottawa-Citizen newspaper.
""It is something that will be with us for the rest of our lives. But the legal side wrapping up will allow people to come to a bit more peace with the situation.""
The proposal also calls for C$75,000 to be used to set up a database for children conceived at his clinics to find out the identity of their father. The purpose of the database will be to provide children with the opportunity to identify their biological fathers, gain access to medical history and to locate any half-siblings.
Dr Barwin and his lawyer had no comment on the matter, but the settlement does not require the former fertility doctor to admit any fault.
He ""has denied and continues to deny all of the plaintiffs' claims in this action,"" lawyers said in court documents filed on Wednesday.
In 2019, Dr Barwin was stripped of his medical license by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, which called his actions ""beyond reprehensible""."
earthquake,"A series of aftershocks jolted central Croatia on Wednesday, a day after a 6.3-magnitude earthquake killed at least seven people, injured dozens and left several towns and villages in ruins.
Authorities warned that the coronavirus could spread in crowded shelters. Many people are in tents, their cars or military barracks.
The strongest, 4.7-magnitude tremor was recorded near the heavily damaged town of Petrinja, some 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of the capital, Zagreb.
Neven Pavkovic, a resident, said the aftershocks kept him awake: ""It was a rough night, I slept maybe half an hour.”
In the hard-hit village of Majske Poljane, where five people died, a little boy could be seen sleeping in a van on the chilly morning.
Sobbing villagers said they received blankets, food and other aid but don’t know what they will do next. Rain that fell overnight turned the dust from the rubble into mud, adding to the hardship.
“We can’t say ‘Good morning,’ It is not good,” Petrinja mayor Darinko Dumbovic told Croatian radio. “We had the third and fourth tremors this morning, short ones but strong. What hasn’t fallen off before is falling now from the ruins of Petrinja.”
“Fear has crept into people,"" he said.
Pope Francis prayed for the victims. At the end of his weekly audience, he said: ”I particularly pray for those who died and for their families.”
Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said the government will declare Saturday a day of national mourning. As the government abolished a travel ban between counties that was imposed during the holidays because of the coronavirus pandemic, Plenkovic appealed for respect for other measures.
“We are still fighting COVID-19, it wouldn’t be good to relax now,” Plenkovic said at a government session.
The International Committee of the Red Cross said it had deployed its Croatian staff in the quake-hit area, and warned of the possible spread of the coronavirus amid the emergency.
“Hundreds of people who were forced to leave their homes are accommodated in communal buildings and tents, while others are seeking shelter in different parts of the country, increasing the risk of transmission,"" a statement said.
Croatian officials said a 12-year-old girl died in Petrinja, a town of some 25,000 people. At least 26 people were hospitalized with injuries.
Tuesday's quake, the strongest in Croatia since the introduction of the modern seismic measurement system, was felt throughout the region, including neighboring Bosnia, Serbia and Slovenia.
The central Croatian region was also struck by a 5.2 earthquake on Monday."
Typhoon,"President Benigno Aquino has travelled to areas in the southern Philippines devastated by a powerful typhoon that struck earlier this week.
Meeting survivors in New Bataan, the scene of deadly flash floods, he said efforts had to be made to ensure such a disaster was not repeated.
A total of 418 people are now confirmed dead and another 383 remain missing, official figures show.
More than 300,000 people are currently staying in evacuation centres.
Typhoon Bopha struck the southern island of Mindanao on Tuesday. High winds and heavy rain damaged a swathe of the island, but the worst-hit areas were two eastern provinces, Compostela Valley and Davao Oriental.
In New Bataan, in Compostela Valley, several buildings - including emergency shelters - were washed away or buried by flash floods and mudslides.
""We want to find out why this tragedy happened and how to keep these tragedies from happening again,"" Mr Aquino was quoted by AFP news agency as telling local residents.
""I am here to listen and hear explanations. This is not a time for accusations. It is a time for work,"" he said.
The typhoon destroyed almost 16,000 houses, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council said, forcing families to seek shelter elsewhere.
Damage so far has been estimated at 4bn pesos ( $100m, ?60m)."

wildfires,"In the dry highlands of Arizona where Jeff Andrews manages wildfires, it’s shaping up to be another white-knuckle summer.
“Things are looking pretty bleak,” said Andrews, deputy fire staff officer for Prescott National Forest. “We had a good amount of rainfall in November and December, but January and February have been dry. It’s going to have a pretty significant impact on the fire season.”
It’s a similarly grim outlook for Don Muise, Andrews’ counterpart in the Coconino National Forest.
“I’ve been burned before by trying to make predictions,” Muise said. “But things aren’t lining up to be much better than last year.”
Predicting a fire season isn’t easy, but one of the biggest indicators is winter rain and snow, Muise said.
Snowpack covering the San Francisco Peaks in Coconino National Forest is at about 60 percent of what it normally is, while rainfall levels in the Verde Valley are about 50 percent of normal.
April, May and June are predicted to be the worst for forest fires, the officers said. The fire season typically begins in March _ when most of the fires are human-caused _ and ends with the monsoon season in August.
The summer of 2011 saw fires consume nearly 900,000 acres of U.S. Forest Service land in Arizona. The Wallow Fire alone burned through more than 538,000 acres over six weeks in eastern Arizona, making it the largest in state history."
Typhoon,"Insured losses in China caused by Typhoon Nesat should be less than $50 million, according to catastrophe modeler EQECAT Inc.
The typhoon made landfall Thursday near Haikou, in China’s Hainan Province, with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph. Nesat earlier struck the Philippines, where Oakland, Calif.-based EQECAT estimated insured damages at less than $100 million.
EQECAT noted that Hainan is primarily an agrarian province, and that insurance penetration as a whole in China is below 20%, depending on region and economic development.
“Low levels of damage combined with low insurance penetration produce an expectation that losses from the catastrophe will remain below $50 million,” EQECAT said in an analysis released Friday."

Typhoon,"Heavy rain and a cyclonic storm are likely at several places in the western parts of India, warned the India Meteorological Department (IMD) in its latest weather forecast on Thursday. The stormy weather is due to a low pressure area over the Arabian Sea. According to the IMD, this is likely to intensify into a cyclonic storm by May 16, and some places in Goa and south Konkan region may see very heavy rainfall. ""A low pressure area has formed over the southeast Arabian Sea and adjoining Lakshadweep area today. It is very likely to become well marked over Lakshadweep area by Friday morning,"" the weather office said.

Typhoon,"Typhoon Fitow barrelled into China's east coast Monday, packing winds of more than 200 kilometres (125 miles) an hour, after hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated and bullet train services were suspended.
At least three people were reported killed, all of them near the city of Wenzhou in Zhejiang province, the state broadcaster CCTV said.
Parts of Zhejiang, which borders the commercial hub Shanghai, saw nearly 29 centimetres (11 inches) of rain over 17 hours from Sunday to early Monday, while areas in Fujian to the south saw up to 16 centimetres, the official China News Service said.
In the hard-hit county of Cangnan in Wenzhou, more than 1,200 homes collapsed and damages amounted to hundreds of millions of yuan, China National Radio said.
One of the victims, 55-year-old Ni Wenlin, died ""after strong wind blew him off a hill"" late Sunday, Xinhua news agency said, citing municipal flood control authorities.
Another person died of electric shock, CCTV reported.
In Fujian the typhoon snapped electricity poles in half, leaving power lines on the ground, and bent iron road signs out of shape, the radio reported.
In the coastal city of Ningde, a village leader told the Beijing Times that huge waves had damaged a 200-hectare (490-acre) seaweed farm, on which nearly 100 families depended for their livelihood.
At least 59 bullet trains in Zhejiang were cancelled, along with 22 flights from the provincial capital Hangzhou and 27 in Wenzhou, Xinhua said.
Sections of highways were shut and more than 350 buses from Wenzhou were cancelled.
Forecasters said the storm was expected to move northwest but weaken quickly.
But continued rainstomes were expected due to another typhoon, Danas, which was set to hit Japan's main islands on Monday.
Packing winds of up to 180 kilometres per hour near its centre, Danas was battering the southern Japanese chain of Okinawa, where more than 50 flights at Naha airport were cancelled while schools were shut, according to local media.
The Japanese meteorological agency issued an alert for strong winds and high waves, while urging residents to remain on guard for floods and landslides as well as lightning and tornadoes.
Local authorities in Okinawa and Kagoshima separately issued evacuation advisories to some 6,500 households, public broadcaster NHK said."
wildfires,"A ferocious wildfire in Northern California that has killed an elderly woman, displaced 13,000 residents and destroyed hundreds of homes continued to grow Monday, chewing through 1,000 more acres by the time night fell.
The explosive Valley fire, which broke out in Lake County on Saturday, has overwhelmed firefighters who have scrambled to keep up with its unpredictable nature. Consuming 62,000 acres -- about 97 square miles _ it prompted the local sheriff to declare it the worst tragedy the area had ever seen.
The rain that fell Monday afternoon appeared to be a sign of reprieve, but fire officials warned that that was not the case.
“The reality is that a fire burning this hot, the falling rain never even makes it to the ground,” said Doug Pittman, a Cal Fire spokesman. “It’s vaporized before it gets to the fire.”
Pittman added that the landscape has become so desiccated that its response to water, even if sprayed directly on grass and trees, is minimal. A shift in other elements -- such as an increase in humidity or a decrease in wind speed -- would actually be more helpful.
The drop in temperature, however, has at least made conditions more comfortable for the 1,800 firefighters on the scene.
“We’ll take any and all precipitation that we can get,” Pittman said.
Shortly after the Valley fire began in the area of Cobb Mountain, residents began calling police for assistance with evacuations, Lt. Steve Brooks of the Lake County Sheriff’s office said in a statement. Hundreds of homes were evacuated in the first few hours."
Typhoon,"Cristobal becomes the earliest third Atlantic named storm on record (CNN)The 2020 hurricane season is only two days old and is already an active one. Cristobal is now the third named storm of the season. It's the earliest a third named storm has ever formed. 2020 Atlantic Hurricane Season Facts >>> Right now Cristobal is a tropical storm with sustained winds of 40 mph with higher gusts. It is moving to the southwest at 3 mph. On its current track, it is expected to continue to interact with southern Mexico over the next several days. The main risk for this storm will continue to be rain. Ten to 20 inches of rain is possible across the Mexican states of Tabasco, Veracrus and Campeche. There could be isolated amounts of more than 2 feet of rain. Some of the Pacific locations in southern Mexico received 20 inches of rain over the weekend, and could get an additional foot of rain. According to the National Hurricane Center, ""Rainfall in all of these areas may produce life-threatening flash floods and mudslides."" ""The Bay of Campeche is notoriously the warmest part of the Gulf region this time of year,"" said CNN Meteorologist Chad Myers. In fact, sea surface temperatures for this area are running 3-4 degrees Fahrenheit above normal right now, providing a lot of fuel for the storm."
Typhoon,"“The United Nations agencies in the Philippines, with their humanitarian partners, are supporting the Government and other responders in their efforts to assess the situation and respond rapidly with vital supplies, through the coordination system led by the local authorities,” said Emergency Relief Coordinator Valerie Amos.
This morning, the UN Disaster Coordination Team (UNDAC) arrived in the city of Tacloban, one of the most affected areas, and reported scenes of total devastation, with all roads from the airport to the town blocked. The UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Food Programme (WFP) have also mobilized their in-country teams to reach those affected.
The Philippines Red Cross said it has received reports of 1,200 deaths in two areas hit by the typhoon, a drastic increase from the three reported yesterday.
“Sadly, it is likely that this figure will rise,” Ms. Amos said. ""The Government estimates that some 4.3 million people are affected, across 36 provinces, and initial assessments show that thousands of homes have been destroyed, roads are impassable and people need food, water, shelter and power.”
According to UNICEF, up to 1.7 million children could be affected by Haiyan. The agency has already mobilized its staff to deliver pre-positioned emergency supplies, and is flying in some 60 metric tonnes of additional supplies from Copenhagen, including medical and shelter equipment. They are expected to arrive within the next three days.
“UNICEF's first priorities are focused on life-saving interventions _ getting essential medicines, nutrition supplies, safe water and hygiene supplies to children and families,” said UNICEF's representative in the Philippines, Tomoo Hozumi.
In addition, the World Food Programme (WFP) has mobilized $2 million for the response, and will be appealing for more funds as the needs become clearer. As a preliminary measure, 40 metric tonnes of high-energy biscuits will be flown in from Dubai in the coming days. These are often provided in the early days of a crisis as they are light to transport and do not need cooking. WFP is also looking at other food commodities to stabilize the nutrition situation.
“The devastation we saw in Tacloban today was shocking,” said WFP Representative and Country Director Praveen Agrawal. “People have lost their homes and livelihoods, and the damage to infrastructure is substantial.""
In a statement issued by his spokesperson, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he was deeply saddened by the extensive loss of life and the serious damage to the infrastructure of the country.
“The Secretary-General offers his sincere condolences to the people and Government of the Philippines, particularly to those who have lost family members, their homes or have been otherwise affected by this disaster,” the statement said.
Haiyan, known locally as Yolanda, is one of the strongest storms ever recorded, hitting landfall with sustained winds of 295 kilometres per hour (kph), placing it above the 252 (kph) threshold for a Category 5 hurricane, the highest category on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. The typhoon is expected to hit Viet Nam later today.
Haiyan is the third major crisis to hit the Philippines in just two months. In October, the Bohol earthquake affected more than 3 million people, triggering landslides engulfing entire homes, ripping apart bridges and tearing down centuries-old churches. Seven cities in three different provinces were initially affected. In September, tens of thousands were forcibly displaced by armed clashes in Zamboanga City in the southern part of the country."
wildfires,"On May 28, 2015, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Aqua satellite acquired this image of smoke from fires in Canada’s Northwest Territories. Red outlines indicate hot spots where MODIS detected unusually warm surface temperatures associated with fire.
Due to a dry spring, forecasts suggested that the territory would see above-average fire danger in May and June. The May 29 wildfire situation report, issued by the Northwest Territories Department of Environment and Natural Resources, noted that there have been 46 total fires so far in 2015 affecting 406 square kilometers (157 square miles). Two of the three most recent fires prior to the report were caused by people: one from an abandoned campfire and another from grass burning. The third was caused by lightning. According to news reports, the summer season in the Northwest Territories was expected to see a return to more normal fire conditions.
Meanwhile, fires burning in Alberta, Canada, (south of this image) displaced thousands of residents and led some energy companies to suspend oil operations. CBC News reported that as of May 28, the Wabasca wildfire was under control, but dry conditions in that province remained a concern. Lighting was responsible for almost half of the 44 fires burning on May 28 across the province."
earthquake,"A 4.7-magnitude earthquake felt throughout the state and beyond late Sunday night appears to be the biggest temblor in Arkansas in more than three decades.
Scott Ausbrooks, the geohazards supervisor for the Arkansas Geological Survey, said the shaking was the most intense of nearly 800 small earthquakes rumbling out of Faulkner County since September and ties a 4.7 quake recorded in 1976. The 4.7-magnitude is still preliminary, but Ausbrooks said Monday it was a ""low-end"" estimate and it is not expected to be downgraded.
The quake was centered near Greenbrier, where much of the seismic activity has occurred in the past six months. The shaking was felt far and wide this time, with thousands of people from Arkansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Mississippi reporting feeling it."
earthquake,"Australia, NZ cancel tsunami warnings as threat from Pacific quake eases WELLINGTON/SYDNEY (REUTERS, AFP) _ A 7.7 magnitude undersea earthquake struck the South Pacific region on Thursday (Feb 10), triggering a brief tsunami warning for Australia and New Zealand that was cancelled, with no immediate reports of damage.  The European Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) said the quake’s epicentre was 417 kilometres east of Tadine, New Caledonia, and at a depth of 10 km.  Tsunami centres across the region sent alerts for the public to stay off beaches and shore areas due to risks of unexpected currents and unusual waves. Those warnings were later cancelled, and authorities said any tsunami threat to mainlands in Australia and New Zealand had passed.  “Based on the most recent modelling and decreasing tsunami amplitudes at North Cape, Great Barrier Island and the East Cape, the tsunami threat has passed for New Zealand,” the National Emergency Management Agency said in a statement.  “There could still be large unexpected currents and the public are advised to continue to take precautions in coastal zones for the rest of today,” it added."
drought,"The United Nations refugee agency said today that with the increasing gravity of the situation in Somalia, where hundreds of thousands of people are suffering because of drought and conflict, it was stepping up assistance with aid distributions across the country’s central and southern parts.
Adrian Edwards, a spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), told a news briefing in Geneva that “although access remains a serious impediment, working with partners on the ground in Somalia we have so far distributed assistance packages to some 90,000 people in Mogadishu and Belet Hawa and Dobley in southwest Somalia.”
The agency is handing out non-food aid for an estimated 126,000 people in other parts of the Gedo and Lower Juba region to the west, with assistance also on its way to Mogadishu and the Afgooye corridor just west of Mogadishu, as well as further southwest in the Lower Shabelle area, Mr. Edwards said.
The agency is strengthening its mechanisms for tracking population movement and protection monitoring in the corridors leading to the Dolo Ado and Dadaab refugee camps in Ethiopia and Kenya respectively.
“Our aim is that through shorter interval reporting we’ll be better able to inform emergency interventions,” Mr. Edwards said. “UNHCR is the primary provider of this information to UN agencies and NGOs operating in Somalia.”
“Given the very serious health state of many refugees arriving at camps in neighbouring countries, UNHCR believes it is of life-saving importance that people in Somalia are able to get help where they need it,” he said. “This may, in certain circumstances, mitigate the necessity to cross borders into neighbouring countries, where refugee camps were already bursting at the seams.”
UNHCR continues to look at all means to step up its efforts inside the country, he said."
drought,"Manitoba farmer Chuck Fossay has never seen his fields this dry.
As he scoops up a handful of black top soil, it runs through his fingers like sand. 
""It's just bone dry. And there's nothing there to support the seed and the crop to grow,"" he said.
Farming near Starbuck, Man., about 20 minutes west of Winnipeg, Fossay is trying to get his canola into the ground. 
He's planting a little deeper this year, hoping to find moisture so the seeds can germinate and start growing.
He hopes that with some well-timed rain, he can still salvage a near-average crop but with conditions this dry, he said it's likely compromised before it's even planted.
""Dry is dry and nothing grows without water. That's just a fact of life. You need water to live. And if you don't have enough water, nothing grows,"" Fossay said.
""If we don't get a rain, a nice, general soaking rain probably the next two weeks, we're probably talking a crop failure out here in Manitoba."""
Typhoon,"Typhoon Utor veered closer to Hong Kong and China's southern coastline on Wednesday after leaving a trail of destruction in the Philippines, where at least six people died.
The weather observatory in the international financial hub was poised to raise its No. 8 tropical cyclone signal early on Wednesday morning, its third highest alert level.
Heavy rain and winds of up to 122 km per hour (76 mph) were recorded in parts of Hong Kong, with a number of flights canceled at the city's international airport.
While financial markets, schools, businesses and non-essential government services close when any No. 8 or above signal is hoisted, the cyclone was not expected to hit Hong Kong directly, but to stray towards the western fringes of China's Guangdong province, nearer to Macau and the island of Hainan.
Should the No. 8 signal remain hoisted until 9 a.m. on Wednesday (0100 GMT), the Hong Kong stock exchange will remain closed for at least part of the day.
As of late Tuesday, more than 3,000 passengers were stranded at Sanya and Haikou airports on Hainan, according to China's official Xinhua news agency.
Some train and shipping services were also suspended, with waves of over 10 meters (32 feet) expected in some coastal zones.
Utor was the worst typhoon to hit the Philippines this year, displacing over 30,000 families as it caused landslides and floods and disrupted power and communications links."
wildfires,"A fast-growing wildfire along the Pacific Coast Highway northwest of Los Angeles nearly doubled in size Friday and was threatening more than 4,000 homes as crews battled strong winds, tinder-dry conditions and record-breaking temperatures.
The Springs Fire had burned more than 28,000 acres of rugged, brush-covered terrain by late afternoon and was 20% contained, the state's fire agency reported.
Forecasters said a weekend of increased humidity should help teams fighting the early-season blaze make gains Saturday.
""It's a total turnaround from what we had,"" said Kurt Kaplan, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Oxnard. ""It should be a much better day for firefighters tomorrow.""
At midday Friday, the temperature hit a record 96 in Camarillo, where the blaze began, about 50 miles north of Los Angeles.
Thousands of residents had already evacuated the Ventura County fire, including 118 families ordered from a premier Navy base because of heavy smoke after flames jumped the scenic highway.
The fire began Thursday during the morning rush hour near U.S. 101, which is the major commuter route into Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley. After reaching the coast overnight, the fire headed back inland Friday.
The fire had damaged 15 homes and destroyed at least 25 outbuildings and other property by midday. Large animals and livestock were being taken to the county fairgrounds.
No operations were affected Friday morning at the sprawling Naval Base Ventura County, which was already operating on an ""essential mission"" basis. The base has a population of more than 19,000 personnel and operates two runways, a sea-test range and deep-water port.
The evacuation order only affected the San Miguel housing unit for the Point Mugu air station. ""This is due to smoke, rather than fire, concerns,"" public affairs officer Kimberly Gearhart announced on the base's Facebook page."
earthquake,"An unusual swarm of temblors in southern Colorado accompanied the state’s strongest earthquake in more than 40 years, shaking bricks and stones loose from buildings and rattling some residents.
“The whole house shook, the bookshelves, the paintings,” said Melissa Mestas, a barista at the What’a Grind Coffee House in Trinidad. “It was really scary and just this helpless feeling.”
The 5.3-magnitude earthquake hit Monday shortly before midnight about 9 miles southwest of Trinidad. Throughout the night and into Tuesday morning, aftershocks — several measuring at a magnitude of 3 or above — continued to unsettle residents. No injuries were reported.
Tuesday morning, the conversation at the coffee house centered on where everybody was when the earthquake hit, Mestas said. Along with the coffee house, several older historical buildings in Trinidad’s downtown had minor damage.
The longtime resident said she is familiar with smaller earthquakes but has never been through one as powerful as Monday night’s.
“It’s piqued a lot of curiosity as to what’s caused this,” Mestas said."
wildfires,"Firefighters in steep terrain and rugged conditions in California are fighting nearly two dozen wildfires that have torched more than 134,000 acres, according to state fire officials.
That's nearly three times the state's 5-year wildfire average of 48,153 acres for this time of year, according to statistics posted by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire.
At 60,000 acres, the Rocky Fire is the largest ongoing blaze. It's led to evacuation orders for more than 13,000 people as it feeds on drought-parched vegetation that hasn't seen fire in many years, according to Cal Fire.
The fire, which is in Lake, Yolo and Colusa counties northwest of Sacramento, was 12% contained, the agency said.
""This has been a very fast-moving wildfire, with the dry conditions and the weather not really cooperating with us over the past week,"" Cal Fire spokesman Daniel Berlant told CNN affiliate KCRA.
More than 2,900 firefighters, 285 engines, four air tankers and 19 helicopters are involved in that fight, Cal Fire says.
Compared with the state's top 20 deadliest fires, which have burned 100,000 acres or more of land, ""this fire does not compare,"" spokesman Berlant told CNN.
But the fire is unique because of the rate it has burned. It chewed through 20,000 acres in about five hours, he said.
Across the state, nearly 10,000 firefighters are working on 21 fires, officials say."
earthquake,"Very strong mag. 6.8 earthquake - Near East Coast of Honshu, Japan, on Saturday, 1 May 2021 at 01:27 (GMT) - information A large quake of magnitude 6.8 struck northeast Japan this morning, but seems to have caused no significant damage or injuries, thanks to the country's excellent building standards and preparedness for large quakes. No tsunami alert was issued - fortunately, the quake was too deep and the mechanism of the faulting that occurred did not trigger any significant waves. Along a 100 km stretch of the coast near Sendai, people experienced strong shaking (VI on the Mercalli scale). Beyond the area of strong shaking, it was felt more lightly in up to several hundreds km distance, over large parts of Japan. Our monitoring service received numerous reports from people all over Honshu who felt it within minutes after the quake struck. Most people described horizontal ground movements that lasted 10-20 seconds, depending on the distance from the epicenter, suggesting that it was mainly the secondary (side-wise swinging) earthquake waves that reached the country's interior. Especially central eastern Honshu, large earthquakes are no strangers: Today's quake occurred only 40 km SE of the magnitude 7 earthquake on 20 March this year, a similar one in February, and 70 km west of the catastrophic Tohoku quake on 11 March 2011, infamous for the large tsunami and following nuclear disaster at Fukushima. Japan's bullet train (Shinkansen) services were temporarily suspended throughout northern Japan, in order to check for possible damages to the rail systems by the quake. As of time of this update, the services in Kanto and Tohoku areas are still on hold. For updated information, please visit the website of the East Japan Rail website. Some power plants and oil processing refineries shot down temporarily as precaution as well, but reported no damages and have been restarting their operations."
earthquake,"CANBERRA, Australia -- A strong, deep earthquake shook inland Papua New Guinea on Friday, and officials said there were no immediate reports of casualties or major damage.
Shaking was felt in the capital Port Moresby but not strongly.
The U.S. Geological Survey said the 7.0 magnitude quake was 80 kilometers (53 miles) deep. Shallower quakes tend to cause more surface damage.
The epicenter was close to Morobe Patrol Post, with a population of 15,000 in Morobe province. Locals reported on social media the wharf at Morobe Patrol Post had “cracked in half.""
Some damage was reported on social media in coastal villages. Residents were advised to go inland if there were any sign of tidal changes or irregular ocean patterns.
Mark Maniaol, a hotel employee in Lae, the capital of Morobe and the country's second-largest city, said he left the quake but it was not severe. He was not aware of any damage in the city.
The Morobe Provincial Disaster Office Director Charley Masange said he did not expect to receive damage reports from the epicenter until Saturday.
“The epicenter is in the mountains. Not many people live there and it's very remote so it takes a long time to get information,” Manage said. “I'm not expecting major damage.”
Papua New Guinea is prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions because it lies along the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” the string of faults around the Pacific Ocean where most of the world's seismic activity occurs."
Typhoon,"Subtropical storm Theta continues to brew in the central Atlantic, but it may be on course to reach the UK. 
We can expect the storm to travel in an east-northeast direction over the next few days, according to a report from the National Hurricane Center. 
It will move between the Azores and the Canary Islands towards Madeira this weekend, bringing a high chance of wet and windy conditions, before potentially hitting England, Wales and southern Ireland early next week.
It is the 29th named storm of the hurricane season, meaning that 2020 has now broken the old record of 28 named storms in 2005. Meteorologists say another could strike in the Caribbean in the coming days.
So far, storm Theta has maximum sustained winds of 50 MPH (85KM/H), but forecasters say it may strengthen slightly in the next 12 to 24 hours.
If Theta continues on its predicted trajectory, it will be felt most strongly across the Bay of Biscay, the La Manche region and throughout England and Wales, bringing with it the possibility of severe winds and heavy rains.
However, there are currently no coastal watches or warnings in effect; it’s still unclear whether the centre of the storm will hit land.
Cyclones within the Atlantic ocean become known as “tropical storms” and receive a name, when their wind speeds exceed 39 MPH. Only if the wind speed exceeds 75 MPH, do they become known as “hurricanes”. 
Tropical storms like Theta are a relatively rare occurrence in Europe, but 2020’s extreme season has seen storms hitting Western parts of Europe with increased frequency and bringing regional flooding, winds and damage.
The damage seen in Europe runs in parallel with the destruction caused this season across the US and countries further south, such as Belize, Bermuda, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Mexico and Guatemala."
drought,"Southern Africa is experiencing one of the worst droughts in years, with more than 40 million people expected to face food insecurity because of livestock and crop losses. Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Zimbabwe have declared it an emergency.
In semi-arid Botswana, the farmers are reeling after the worst drought in a decade wiped out entire harvests and left the land littered with dead livestock.
Two thirds of the crops planted last season failed, while Ngamiland, a rich beef producing region, has recorded nearly 40,000 cattle deaths.
Rancher Casper Matsheka says there was no food or water, so his animals starved to death.
“The goats died, as well as the cattle, as you can see the carcasses all over. We were really affected. If only the government could subsidize the prices of feed and vaccines for the livestock during such times,” he said.
Nor has the drought sparred wildlife.
National parks authorities have resorted to feeding starving hippos while hundreds of elephants have died.
Environmental nongovernment organization, Kalahari Conservation Society’s Neil Fitt says competition for food and water has increased the risk of human-wildlife conflict.
“The livestock are now putting pressure on the wildlife areas, so the wildlife are also getting pressure on their areas, and that is where the conflict zone is,” he said. “Why I am bringing this up? The... interconnected with the drought is this wildlife-human conflict.”
In Botswana, where drought is frequent, President Mokgweetsi Masisi said the government plans to stop calling it an emergency and instead make drought relief part of the national budget.
“Government has taken a decision to develop a Drought Management Strategy, which would classify drought as a permanent feature in our budget plans, rather than an emergency,” he said. “The strategy will be completed before the end of the financial year.”
Acting director of Meteorological Services Radithupa Radithupa says a robust strategy is needed to deal with the recurring droughts.
“We are looking at climate change as an impact now, we are seeing the impact now in terms of heating, the dry spells and the excessive rains. Therefore, we really need to adapt as a nation,” Radithupa said.
Meanwhile, a forecast for rain has raised hopes among farmers and ranchers for recovery and that this season of severe drought won’t be a total loss."
wildfires,"Just before the COVID-19 pandemic, bush fires in Australia destroyed more than 3,000 homes and burnt millions of hectares of vegetation. The crisis exposed the nation’s fire monitoring system as being unfit for purpose. Precise real-time information about the area burnt and the intensity of the fires was not available when it was needed.
Australia does not have a central system for gathering and storing essential information about bush fires. State and territory governments, and even agencies within states, have different approaches. This worked fine when fires were smaller. But those in the 2019_20 season crossed multiple state borders.
The blazes engulfed a huge geographic range and burnt for a duration and intensity that was beyond the experience of communities and fire managers1. Many Australians endured five months of smoke pollution that breached national air-quality standards. Usually, people would experience shorter bouts covering smaller areas2.
The extraordinary scale and intensity of the fires were driven by climate conditions not seen in a century: three years of drought, including three consecutive, anomalously dry winters3. This weather is consistent with predictions that global warming will result in conditions that increase the risk of fire4,5. Studies have linked extreme bush-fire seasons over the past few years to anthropogenic climate change
Debate over the cause of the bush fires became politically charged. Fire scientists and managers had to stem misinformation from politicians and the media suggesting that the fires were not unusual historically and were not linked to climate change. There were even suggestions that the fires were the result of arson, or of inappropriate land management8_10. Staggering environmental consequences were claimed, including greenhouse-gas emissions that were exceeded only by those in China, the United States, India, Russia and Japan, and the loss or displacement of more than one billion native vertebrates."
Typhoon,"Rescuers continued to search central Japan on Monday as the death toll from the worst typhoon to hit the country in seven years climbed to 26.
Typhoon Talas, later downgraded to a tropical storm, lashed coastal areas at the weekend before moving offshore into the Sea of Japan. Fifty-two people were missing and thousands stranded as the typhoon washed away bridges, railways and roads.
The scenes of destruction were an unwelcome reminder of Japan's vulnerability to natural disasters as the country attempts to recover from the 11 March earthquake and tsunami.
The prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, who was sworn in a day before the storm, said the government would provide assistance as quickly as possible.
His predecessor, Naoto Kan, was forced out of office chiefly because of public anger over the government's response to the tsunami, which left nearly 21,000 people dead or missing and sparked the world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986."
drought,"Once the wettest place on Earth, Cherrapunji, a town in northeastern India, has faced a drought each winter for the past few years. Kerala, a state in the southwest, flooded devastatingly in 2018, but saw its wells run dry soon after.
Chennai, a growing south-Indian metropolis, was inundated by rains in 2015—but this summer, waiting for the monsoon, its 11 million residents have watched three of its four reservoirs run dry. Meanwhile, across India, the groundwater that provides an invaluable buffer between monsoons is severely depleted and in danger of being irreversibly lost.
Welcome to the new India: hot and desiccated and wet and flooded, all at once, with the fates of 1.3 billion people and rich biodiversity hotspots riding upon increasingly unpredictable rains.
The southwest monsoon, which usually drenches India from June to September, has come ten days late this year, bringing 30 percent less rain than normal for the month of June. In the north, Delhi has thus far seen almost no rain, while in southern India reservoir levels in southern India are running dangerously low. Headlines in newspapers scream “zero-day” and “running dry” and “historic drought.”
Chennai, a megacity now dependent on tanker trucks, leads the grim news. But Bangalore, India’s answer to Silicon Valley, is not far behind. There are murmurs that this burgeoning, bulging city will have used all its groundwater by 2020.
The dire predicaments of these two urban areas is a cautionary tale—a symptom of the larger malaise that plagues water management in a country that is soon to be the most populous on Earth."
drought,"Djibouti is one of the smallest countries on the African continent. Situated between Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia, the total population is approximately 820,000 people. These factors alone make it an easy country to overlook in the context of the current drought. Next to the emergency crises in Kenya and Somalia, the needs of the drought-affected population may seem insignificant. Yet this is not a sufficient reason to neglect Djiboutians who are asking for help.
The IFRC together with the Djibouti Red Crescent have been undergoing an assessment throughout the country, and the needs are quite real. In Garabtisan village, northern Djibouti, there are approximately 1500 people - including 300 children - who have been facing a drought for the past five years.
“There is no public school for our children”, explained Madina, a mother of nine children. “We used to have a Koranic school, but the last wind storm knocked down the tree where lessons took place. Now, there is no place for children to learn.” It is a symbolic loss for this community who are on the brink of an emergency crisis.
In Garabtisan village, women such as Madina have only 40 litres of water for a period of 2 to 3 days to support the needs of an entire family. The nearest water source requires that women walk the distance of 23km, or they wait for water delivery from the military stationed nearby. But with a community of 1500 people, it is simply impossible for the military to adequately service the needs of Garabtisan village without support. In addition to high food prices, geographical isolation and the depletion of livestock, their situation is increasingly desperate.
Access to health care is another critical problem for women and children in Garabtisan village. When a child falls ill, the community is unable to respond. Each month there are approximately 6 to 7 births, with a loss of 2 to 3 children. The mobile health clinic provided by the Ministry of Health faces significant logistical challenges to reach the community as needed.
Yet the people of Garabtisan have dignity. Their cultural traditions practice basic hygiene such as washing children’s hands before eating, or defecating away from the home. Madina clearly wants to be a good mother, and meet the basic needs of her children.
The Djibouti Red Crescent and IFRC recognise the clear needs in drought-affected areas such as Garabtisan village. The Government of Djibouti has claimed there are 120,000 in need of critical assistance in rural areas. This indicates that 1 out of 8 persons are in need of emergency aid.
However the response cannot be successful by one agency or government ministry alone. Joint action is needed in Djibouti, in order to meet the challenges of drought-affected communities. Although the figures may be comparatively small to the rest of the Horn of Africa, women and mothers in desperate need, such as Madina, should be enough to take action."
Typhoon,"Tropical storm Arthur tracks NC coast. Cyclone Amphan threatens India/Bangladesh Tropical storm Arthur, the first named storm of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, formed at the weekend off the coast of Florida as an early reminder of the months to come. Arthur remains a weak tropical storm and is expected to near the North Carolina coast but then curve out to sea. Meanwhile, a much more dangerous tropical cyclone named Amphan is set to bring dangerous conditions to India and Bangladesh later this week, with the Category 4 equivalent strength storm set to bring hurricane force winds and a storm surge to a region populated by millions of people. Tropical storm Arthur: First, tropical storm Arthur which became an early pre-season tropical storm, as we suggested it would on Friday. Tropical storm Arthur is moving north in-line with the eastern seaboard of the United States, passing the Carolina’s. Tropical storm Arthur is forecast to come closest to the North Carolina coast around the Outer Banks, but then curve out into the Atlantic. Tropical storm Arthur currently has sustained winds of around 45 mph, with higher gusts, with tropical storm force winds extending out some 90 miles from the centre of the storm. The National Hurricane Center warns of tropical storm force winds for parts of the North Carolina coast, with how close Arthur eventually gets driving the strength of any wind gusts. In addition, rainfall of 1 to 3 inches is widely expected across parts of North Carolina, with isolated maximum amounts of 5 inches. Even if tropical storm Arthur came closer to shore, or made a landfall, it will not strengthen significantly before its closest pass to the North Carolina region it now seems. Arthur does not pose any real threat to insurance or reinsurance market interests at this time. But the storm is an early reminder of the season to come and will ensure reinsurance and insurance-linked securities (ILS) markets remain focused on the wind risk component of their renewals at this time of year."
earthquake,"Magnitude 6.9 Quake Hits Northeastern Japan, Shakes Tokyo A magnitude 6.9 quake hit off the coast of northeastern Japan, briefly triggering a tsunami advisory for Miyagi prefecture and causing shaking in Tokyo. Initial damage reported from the earthquake that occurred Saturday evening were minor compared to the magnitude 7.3 quake that struck about a month ago further south on Japan’s Pacific coast. About 200 buildings in Miyagi prefecture were left without power, Tohoku Electric Power Co. said, while broadcaster NHK said some bullet train services in the region were suspended. No abnormalities were reported at Fukushima’s Dai-ichi and Dai-ni nuclear plants, according to Tokyo Electric Power Co. Tohoku Electric Power said no irregularities were reported at its Onagawa nuclear plant."
drought,"One northwestern New Mexico city is trying to curb water use as the region deals with persistent drought.
The Farmington City Council passed a resolution Tuesday enacting a water shortage advisory that calls for residents to cut their use by 10%. The advisory will remain in place until further notice.
Lake Farmington supplies the city with drinking water and is fed by the Animas and San Juan rivers. City officials say low stream flows and the likelihood of continued dryness will prevent the community’s water supplies from being replenished so they’re trying to lower overall demand on the system.
The latest map shows severe to extreme drought centered over the area. All but a tiny sliver in northeastern New Mexico is grappling with some form of drought, making for a worse situation than just three months ago and much worse than the same period last year.
Some parts of the state received much needed rain and snow overnight Tuesday, but forecasters are expecting below normal precipitation later this fall.
The city of Farmington is urging residents to take shorter showers and not let the water run when brushing teeth or shaving. They’re also asking people to limit outdoor watering to certain hours, repair any leaks immediately and refrain from washing vehicles at home."
earthquake,"At least 31 people have been killed and more than 1,600 injured in a powerful earthquake in eastern Turkey.
The magnitude-6.8 quake centred on the town of Sivrice in Elazig province caused buildings to collapse and sent residents rushing into the street.
Forty-five people have been rescued so far, with more than 20 feared to remain trapped, officials say.
Earthquakes are common in Turkey - about 17,000 people died in a quake in the western city of Izmit in 1999.
Friday's quake struck at about 20:55 local time (17:55 GMT).
Tremors were also felt in neighbouring Syria, Lebanon and Iran.
More than 400 aftershocks were recorded, Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (Afad) said.
Rescue teams worked through the night, using their hands, drills and diggers to try to find people in the rubble of fallen buildings. They also brought beds and tents for those displaced, and warned residents against returning to damaged buildings because of the danger of aftershocks.
Afad said that most of the casualties were in Elazig province, and deaths were also reported in the neighbouring province of Malatya.
Some 1,607 people were injured by the earthquake, according to the latest count."
other,"After more than a decade of dominance the era of Usain Bolt is over and someone other than the Jamaican great will be crowned men's 100m champion at the Tokyo Olympics.

Bolt will go down as one of the greatest athletes of all time having stormed to 100m victory at the Beijing, London and Rio Games, adding three successive 200m golds for good measure.

But the world record holder retired from athletics in 2017, finally giving someone else a chance of glory.

With time having also caught up with 2004 gold medallist Justin Gatlin, and world champion Christian Coleman serving an 18-month anti-doping ban, this feels very much like the start of a new era in the Olympics' traditional blue riband event."
other,"UNHCR rushing to help displaced after volcano eruption in DR Congo This is a summary of what was said by UNHCR spokesperson Boris Cheshirkov _ to whom quoted text may be attributed _ at today's press briefing at the Palais des Nations in Geneva. Following the eruption of the Mount Nyiragongo volcano in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) on 22 May, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is assessing the needs of affected communities in the city of Goma. Thousands of people fled their homes on foot on Saturday night, carrying mattresses and other belongings as lava flowed towards Goma, burning down villages on the way. Many of them were welcomed by host families in Goma and surrounding areas, while several thousand fled across the border into Rwanda."
wildfires,"Wildfires, peat fires and controlled burns on farming lands kill 339,000 people worldwide each year, said a study released on Saturday that is the first to estimate a death toll for landscape fires.
Most of those deaths are concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa, where an estimated 157,000 people die as a result of being exposed to such fires annually, with southeast Asia ranking second with 110,000 deaths.
""I was surprised at our estimate being so high when you consider that the exposure to fire smoke is quite intermittent for most people,"" said lead author Fay Johnston of the University of Tasmania.
""Even in southeast Asia and Africa, (fire) is a seasonal phenomenon. It is not year round,"" Johnston said at the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting in Vancouver where she presented her research.
The study, which Johnston said was the first of its kind to attempt to estimate a death toll from wildfires and landscape burns, was published Saturday in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives.
Researchers looked at the number of deaths from all causes in areas that were exposed to heavy smoke and landscape fire between 1997 and 2006.
They used satellite data and chemical transport models to assess the health impacts of particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers, a major byproduct of landscape fire smoke.
The number of deaths from wildfires came in far below the previously estimated global tolls for indoor air pollution at two million people per year and urban air pollution at 800,000.
However, the study authors said their findings indicated that ""fire emissions are an important contributor to global mortality.""
The research also suggested a significant link between climate and fire mortality.
About twice as many people died during El Nino years when the surface ocean temperature rises in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean (averaging 532,000) as during cooler La Nina years (averaging 262,000)."
Typhoon,"Four people were killed while 67 — including 53 fishermen and nine mountaineers — remained missing as Typhoon Utor left for the South China Sea after a deadly 24-hour landfall in Luzon on Monday.
Reynaldo de la Cruz, 53, drowned in Nueva Vizcaya, northern Luzon on Tuesday, a day after Typhoon Utor entered Aurora Province causing floods, landslides and toppling trees and power lines, said Undersecretary Eduardo del Rosario, head of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC).
Del Rosario added that Joemar Salicong, 22, died in a landslide in Tuba, Benguet, also in northern Luzon on Monday.
Earlier on Saturday Dolores Montero, 68 and her granddaughter Erica Montero Sim, 8, drowned when their motorboat was destroyed off Buenavista coastal village in Cagnion, Surigao, central Philippines, another affected area, said del Rosario.
He said the two victims were identified by NDRRMC’s provincial office.
Meanwhile, a ground report from northern Luzon said that Benny Labio, 40, died when his house was swallowed by the Cagayan River in Maand village, San Agustin town, meaning the number of fatalities could reach five.
“We hope this is the final list of casualties,” del Rosario said, adding the number could change dramatically in the storm’s aftermath.
Some 35 fishermen from the western Pangasinan towns of Infanta and Bolinao were reported missing after they failed to return home from sailing on August 5 and 8, said del Rosario, adding that five of the fishermen were not yet identified.
Some 23 fishermen from Camarines Norte and Catanduanes in Bicol, southern Luzon, remained missing after they set sail last week, before Typhoon Utor was seen in the Pacific Ocean, said del Rosario, adding they were part of a group of 75 fishermen who sailed to the sea, 52 of whom managed to return safely on Sunday.
Meanwhile, nine mountaineers were reported missing after they failed to return from Mount Tarak in Alas-asin village, in Bataan on Saturday, Bataan Governor Albert Garcia said, adding that Typhoon Utor might be responsible for their disappearance. Their names were not released.
Some 30 kilometres of road was flooded in Dilasalag, Aurora, the hardest hit province in northeastern Luzon, where three towns, Casiguran, Dilasag, and Dinalungan were declared in a state of calamity, said del Rosario.
Ninety per cent of crops were damaged in Dilasalag due to floods, confirmed Mayor Victorio Briones.
Almost all roads were impassable due to floods and landslides in many towns of Aurora, said Aurora Governor Gerardo Noveras, adding that power came back 24 hours after rains and winds toppled electric poles in these towns.
Seventy three houses were damaged while five were destroyed in Aurora, said Noveras, adding the typhoon’s wrath is still being assessed in Aurora’s tow other towns such as Dingalan and Dipaculao.
People stranded on riverbanks were evacuated in coastal towns of Nueva Vizcaya, another hard hit area in northern Luzon, TV footage showed.
In other submerged areas, rising rivers swept animals, crops, and houses, the same report said.
Floods isolated several towns in Isabela province although it was not directly hit by the typhoon, said Isabela Gov. Faustino Dy III.
People rejoiced when nine passengers and a driver emerged alive from a vehicle that was buried by a landslide in Itogon town, northern Luzon on Tuesday morning, said Chief Inspector Fernando Botangen of the Itogon police.
A four-metre high flood occurred in Baguio City’s Camp Lagoon. The northern Luzon summer capital also suffered power outage, telecommunications failure, and road closures due to rockfalls.
The typhoon dumped most of its 24-hour rain in northern Luzon’s Baguio City; central Luzon’s Dagupan and Cabanatuan cities and Iba town, Zambales, said the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa), a government run weather station.
Typhoon Utor left the Philippines early on Tuesday morning, Pagasa confirmed.
A total of 20 storms enter the Philippines every year."
wildfires,"The Rough Fire in the Sierra National Forest in Fresno County is 29 percent contained at more than 119,000 acres. It is the largest active wildfire in California.
""The Rough Fire is now the 18th largest fire in our state's history and over the past several months has been primarily burning in the national forest,"" says Daniel Berlant, with Cal Fire.
Berlant says Cal Fire crews will work with U.S. Forest Service firefighters as the fire spreads. 
""Now it is starting to come off of the national forest and threaten private lands that we are responsible for protecting,"" says Berlant. ""We are bringing in additional resources to help keep the communities in Fresno County safe and to do our part to assist in containing this fire."" 
New evacuations and road closures were issued Friday.
There are more than 2,200 firefighters working the Rough Fire, which was started by lightning in July.
Unhealthy air quality, including smoke from the Rough Fire, is affecting eight counties in the San Joaquin Valley.
The San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District has issued an air alert and health warning for poor air quality.
The U.S. Forest Service says ""unhealthy to hazardous [air quality] conditions are expected in communities near the fire.""
Another downside to the smoke: It may limit the use of air resources, which drop retardant on the fire."

wildfires,"California is in the death grip of a historic drought, and the situation is only getting worse as fire season is evolving into a year-round event.
Cal Fire fire captain Mike Mohler told NBC News with the lack of moisture, “You get explosive fire growth.”
The peak for California’s wildfires is usually summer into early fall, intensifying by late-September or October due to Santa Ana and Diablo winds, weather.com senior meteorologist Jon Erdman explained in an earlier story. The threat typically diminishes in the winter, which is considered the region's ""wet"" time of year, because of growing mountain snowpack and returning moisture. 
But during the last two winter seasons, the rain and mountain snow totals in the region were well below average. The lack of moisture is no more apparent anywhere else than it is in the California's Sierra Nevada mountain range, where snowpack has plunged to record lows.
“The outlook in California is pretty dire,” Wally Covington, a leading fire ecologist at Northern Arizona University told Grist. “It’s pretty much a recipe for disaster.”
In fact, while the national wildfire tally has been below average this year, the average in California has been 38% above average, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Over 4,000 acres have burned in California this year, which is almost double the amount at the same time last year. 
The community of Swall Meadows, nestled in the Eastern Sierra, is one example of the growing hazard of explosive fires, as they experienced a blaze that burned 35 homes and swept over 7,000 acres of land this past winter, San Jose Mercury News reported."
earthquake,"Magnitude 7.7 earthquake strikes off the coast of Jamaica and is felt as far away as Miami A magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck Tuesday about 80 miles from Jamaica, shaking people in the Caribbean and as far away as Miami. A tsunami of 0.4 feet was recorded in the Cayman Islands at George Town, but no tsunami was observed at Port Royal, Jamaica, or Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic. There were several aftershocks, including one the US Geological Survey said had a magnitude of 6.1. ""Based on all available data, there is no significant tsunami threat from this (6.1) earthquake. However, there is a very small possibility of tsunami waves along coasts located nearest the epicenter,"" the National Weather Service's Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said. The quakes come three weeks after a magnitude 6.4 earthquake struck Puerto Rico. A tsunami threat alert was lifted Tuesday afternoon, a few hours after the quake. Earlier, a tsunami of 0.4 feet was recorded in the Cayman Islands at George Town, but no tsunami was observed at Port Royal, Jamaica or Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic. Alec Pultr, who lives in Ogier, Grand Cayman, said it wasn't the first earthquake he's experienced but it was the biggest ""by far.""

Typhoon,"Tropical Storm Gonzalo approaches the Caribbean, could strengthen into a hurricane Tropical Storm Gonzalo is accelerating as it moves towards the southern Caribbean, the National Hurricane Center said Friday morning. Gonzalo formed on Wednesday in the central Atlantic Basin, and forecasts show there's a chance it could strengthen into a hurricane. A hurricane watch is in effect for the islands of Barbados, St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Those islands plus St. Lucia are also under a tropical storm warning. As of 11 a.m. Friday, Gonzalo had maximum sustained winds near 50 mph, with higher gusts, and was moving to the west at about 18 mph. The storm is forecast to reach the southern Lesser Antilles by Saturday. Meanwhile, in the eastern Pacific Ocean, a hurricane may threaten Hawaii by Saturday. Hurricane Douglas reached major hurricane strength — Category 3 — with winds of 130 mph as of late Thursday, located 1,250 miles east-southeast of Hilo, Hawaii. Douglas is forecast to weaken as it approaches Hawaii by later Saturday into Sunday morning. It may still be a hurricane or strong tropical storm when it reaches Hawaii. It will likely pass just north of the Big Island and possibly make landfall Sunday as a hurricane or tropical storm on Maui. Watch for heavy rain, flash flooding and winds gusting over 75 mph. If it Douglas does make landfall as a hurricane, it would only be the third time in record-keeping history that Hawaii has seen a landfalling hurricane."
Typhoon,"Typhoon Nuri weakened to a severe tropical storm as it landed in Hong Kong on Friday, bringing strong winds and rainfall but inflicting little damage.
No major destruction was reported, unlike in the Philippines, where Nuri killed seven people and triggered landslides and floods in the north.
But with Nuri landing in Hong Kong late Friday afternoon, the Hong Kong Observatory said it had weakened from a typhoon to a severe tropical storm. By late Friday night, the storm was headed northwest toward the southern Chinese city Guangzhou.
In Hong Kong, a man went missing while swimming off a local beach and 11 people were injured during the storm, with three in serious condition, the government said in a statement.
There also were reports of toppled trees, collapsed walls and scaffoldings.
The Hong Kong Observatory issued its second-highest tropical cyclone warning.
Flights, bus and ferry services were canceled, and offices, schools and financial markets were closed. At least 388 passenger flights were either canceled or delayed and another 15 diverted, the government said in a statement.
Officials have evacuated 87,000 people and recalled more than 45,000 vessels in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
The bad weather didn't affect the Olympic equestrian competition, which finished late Thursday."
drought,"Over the past two years, drought has severely affected much of Brazil. According to a bulletin from the National Center for Monitoring and Alerts on Natural Disasters (Cemaden), an agency of the Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovations and Communications, rainfall has been below historical averages in the center-west, south and part of the southeast regions of the country, including in the state of S?o Paulo.
The phenomenon became more evident in 2012. “Severe drought started in the northeast and lasted almost seven years,” says Cemaden researcher Adriana Cuartas. “Then, in 2014, water supply was in critical conditions in the Greater S?o Paulo area. Now the focus of concerns turns to the south, where rainfall has been below average for almost two years.”
Scientist Ant?nio Donato Nobre, author of the report “The Future Climate of Amazonia,” is emphatic: “South America is drying up as a result of the combined effects of deforestation and climate change.”
Low precipitation has an immediate impact on agriculture. The next affected are water supply and power generation. Water levels in the reservoirs of several dams have been low, including Itaipu, the world’s second-largest hydroelectric power plant. “The water that comes from the rivers to the reservoir is below the minimum level recorded in 1993. It’s a critical situation,” Cuartas says. “The Itaipu basin is used not only for power generation, but also for water supply.”
Recent rains in the south may bring temporary relief to agriculture, but water conditions take time to return to normal. “Rainfall would have to be at average levels or above for several months for the water system to start recovering and resume expected levels,” Cuartas says.
Agribusiness has been suffering losses as a result of drought, but it also contributes to the changes in the water regime. Deforesting the Amazon to establish cattle ranches, plantations and logging reduces precipitation in Brazil and other Latin American countries. With deforestation increasing, agribusiness and power generation may collapse in Brazil.
The Amazon Forest works as a cooling system. On a single day, a robust tree with its 20-meter (66-foot) canopy pumps around 1,100 liters (290 gallons) of water into the atmosphere. These masses of air carrying vapor from the forest’s transpiration are called “flying rivers.” They take humidity from the Amazon Basin to Brazil’s center-west, southeast and south regions as well as to neighboring countries. With fewer trees in the forest, there is less humidity in the air. And that leads to drought."

Authorities in central Japan say 47 people are now confirmed to have died from the deadliest volcanic eruption in post-war Japan. Police earlier said the number of dead was 48, but later corrected the figure. Authorities in Nagano prefecture believe all of the known victims have been recovered after the surprise eruption of Mount Ontake, which occurred Saturday. Most of the bodies of hikers have been found near the summit where a shrine attracts visitors. The remains of others were discovered at a slightly lower elevation where there is little place to hide. Hundreds of survivors were trapped on the mountain until Saturday evening, many of them having suffered serious cuts, bruises and bone fractures."

Most of the destruction happened in the southeastern section of town, where half the homes were consumed by flames Sunday. The mall, town hall and many downtown businesses were destroyed.
The fire was still considered out of control as of 6 p.m. MT Monday.
Almost all 7,000 residents have been evacuated from the town, hundreds going to evacuation shelters in Athabasca, Westlock and Edmonton.
As of Monday evening, about 800 to 1,000 people were at the Athabasca shelter, 195 were in Edmonton and 46 people were staying in Westlock. Provincial officials said there is room for more people in all three locations.
Premier Ed Stelmach toured the fire zone Monday afternoon. He said the province will help fire victims but that people need to be patient before they return.
""I know it's difficult because everybody's really concerned about their home and whether there's damage, or burnt to the ground and what's salvagable,"" he said.
""It has to be done orderly, because it is a very large area and we want to make sure that anybody coming back here is safe.""
Stelmach struck a task force of governmental ministries and agencies to deal with the immediate needs of the community and to provide support services to the residents of Slave Lake over the coming days, weeks and months.
Stelmach said he spoke with Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who offered assistance. Stelmach said provincial employees are at the evacuation centres to get an idea of what sort of help the burned-out residents need.
Reporters were also taken on a tour of the town Monday, where they saw homes burned to their foundations, charred rubble and at least 100 burned-out vehicles."

Typhoon,"Heavy rainfall was expected all through the weekend in northern and northeastern Taiwan due to the approach of Typhoon Fitow, the Central Weather Bureau said Saturday.
The bureau issued a land warning for Taipei, New Taipei, Keelung and Yilan Saturday afternoon, though it added that torrential rain was possible as far south as Taichung and Nantou County.
At 9 p.m. Saturday, Fitow was located about 440 kilometers east of Taipei and moving west-north-west at a speed of 19 km per hour, according to the weather bureau. The storm was packing sustained winds of 137 km per hour with gusts of up to 173 km per hour. The storm’s route was 20 to 40 km more southerly than originally expected, which meant Taoyuan and Hsinchu could eventually also be covered by the land warnings, reports said.
By early Sunday afternoon, the center of the storm would have moved to 240 km northeast of Taipei over the ocean, the bureau said. The eye of the typhoon was unlikely to make landfall but nevertheless, forecasters still cautioned residents to be prepared for strong winds and heavy rains as well as flooding and mudslides, even in southern mountain areas.
The total amount of rainfall in the north could reach 350 millimeter over the next 24 hours, according to the bureau. The highest amount of rain Saturday until 9:20 p.m. was the 151 mm recorded in New Taipei City’s Wulai District.
Sea warnings were also in effect on Taiwan’s east side and in most of the Taiwan Straits with the exception of the Kaohsiung and Pingtung coastal areas. Strong waves were expected to hit most coastal areas, including those of Orchid Island and Green Island in the southeast, the bureau said.
The typhoon would leave Taiwan behind on Monday, but another storm was already on the way, according to the bureau.
The next tropical storm on the horizon, Danas, was unlikely to speed up sufficiently to combine forces with Fitow, experts said. Fitow was expected to make landfall in China Monday and to weaken considerably thereafter, while Danas was likely to move in the direction of Japan, though it was not clear yet how serious its impact on Taiwan might be. Some forecasters have suggested that the storm might affect the island’s Double Ten National Day celebrations Thursday.

Typhoon,"Millions of residents were affected as a rainstorm hit a large swathe of eastern China on Tuesday, flooding downtown areas and snarling traffic.
The storm, triggered under the influence of Typhoon Fitow, continued to strike Shanghai and Zhejiang province, forcing both to raise the rainstorm alarm to the highest level of red on Tuesday morning.
In the 12 hours up to 11 am on Tuesday Shanghai reported average rainfall of more than 100 millimeters, while on the outskirts of the city 200 mm fell.
Zhang Ruiyi, a chief service officer at the Shanghai Meteorological Bureau, said the storm was caused by the remaining depression from Fitow encountering cold air.
The continuous rain, the rising tide and discharge of floodwater from upstream Taihu Lake caused the Huangpu River, which runs through Shanghai, to rise past the warning line on Tuesday.
According to the city's flood control headquarters, the river burst its flood control wall in suburban sections. No deaths were reported in the region.
In Zhejiang, Yuyao, a city with a population of about 850,000, was one of the hardest hit. More than 70 percent of the city's downtown area was flooded, forcing public transportation to be suspended.
The city's power and tap water supplies were also interrupted, and residents are short of food and clean water. Soldiers rushed in large trucks and speedboats to help with disaster response.
But relief for residents in the region is on the way, with forecasters in Shanghai predicting cloudy weather on Wednesday and clear skies from Thursday.
Meteorological authorities in Zhejiang lowered the red rainstorm alarm at 12:30 pm on Tuesday, saying that most areas of the province will remain cloudy on Wednesday and Thursday, with showers in some areas.
Typhoon Danas, following on the heels of Fitow, has turned northeast in the Pacific and is unlikely to make landfall on the Chinese mainland. Meteorologists warned that high winds will hit the east coast although Danas has been weakening.
The death toll from Fitow and the rainstorm it generated has risen to six with another four missing in Zhejiang.
Figures from the provincial flood control headquarters show that by 6 pm on Monday more than 6.31 million people had been affected, with 4,000 houses flattened.
Floods also damaged hundreds of thousands of hectares of crops, killed more than 11,000 livestock, disrupted traffic and telecommunications, put dams and reservoirs at risk and caused direct economic losses of 8.4 billion yuan ($1.37 billion) in Zhejiang.
Li Minji, an official at Hangzhou's flood control department, said flooding was reported in 31 communities and 58 sections of roads in the city on Tuesday, with emergency workers busy clearing floodwaters and bringing in traffic controls.
The water level at popular tourist attraction West Lake rose to 7.48 meters on Tuesday, 0.18 meters higher than the danger level.
In Shanghai, pictures posted by Internet users showed a flooded classroom at Tongji University, two residents in Songjiang district rowing a boat on a flooded road, and a bus nearly submerged in a low-lying area.
Cheng Xu, 40, was just one of many people caught out by the floods on Monday. Her flight, due to arrive at Hangzhou airport at 7 am, was delayed for four hours. A shuttle bus then took two and a half hours to make a journey usually taking 45 minutes.
After she got off the bus, it took her another two hours to get close to her home, with traffic controls in place on the road to her apartment building because of the flooding.
""No cars were allowed on that road. I dragged my suitcases, weighing almost 20 kilograms, and walked in heavy rain from the street to my apartment,"" she said.
Zhu Zheng, who lives in Hangzhou's Yuhang district, said he woke up to find floodwater inside at least 12 cars in the area.
Flood control departments in Zhejiang launched an emergency response system to help deal with the flooding and urged regional governments to pay close attention to mountain torrents, mudslides, landslides, flash floods in cities and house collapses."

Despite marginal conditions for development _ sea surface temperatures (SSTs) near 25 degrees Celsius (77°F), moderate wind shear, and dry air _ TD 5 managed to intensify into Tropical Storm Edouard at 11 p.m. EDT July 5. By 11 a.m. EDT July 6, Edouard had intensified to 45 mph winds as it sped northeast at 37 mph over the open Atlantic. Edouard was the earliest fifth Atlantic named storm formation on record, beating the record set by Emily on July 12, 2005. The fifth named storm of the year typically does not occur until August 31, so we are nearly two months ahead of climatology. None of this year’s named storms have been hurricanes, and the first hurricane of the season usually arrives by August 10. According to the Colorado State University real-time hurricane activity site, the North Atlantic has had about 340% of the usual amount of Accumulated Cyclone Energy, or ACE, by July 6: 6.5 units, compared to the 30-year average of 1.9 units. For comparison, the Northeast Pacific has had 3% of its average ACE expected by that same date; the Northwest Pacific 17%; and the North Indian Ocean 234%. All told, the Northern Hemisphere is running at less than half of its usual activity up as of July 6, as the Pacific normally produces the great majority of the hemisphere’s ACE up to that date."

Minor disruptions could occur during shutdowns, but service will likely resume quickly if no damage is found. Utility outages are possible, particularly near the earthquake's epicenter."
Typhoon,"At least 17 people have been killed in Japan by powerful typhoon Wipha, according to media reports.
The typhoon hit Izu Oshima, an island south of Japan’s capital city Tokyo, on Wednesday morning. It threw life out of gear by causing landslides and flooding in the island. More than 80 centimetres of rain fell in a span of 24 hours in the island.
Around 50 people have been reported missing.  Japan Meteorological Agency had earlier called the typhoon as once-in-a-decade-event.
The typhoon has been downgraded to a “tropical storm” and is heading north-east. Reports also say that Fukushima nuclear plant, which was badly hit when a tsunami and an earthquake struck simultaneously in March 2011, did not face much damage. Nuclear plant authorities were quoted saying, “the typhoon has caused no new damage to the plant”.
It has also been reported that many houses have been buried in mudslides, triggered by the rain, trapping people underneath. Rescue operations are on and flights and trains in Tokyo have been cancelled."
wildfires,"Strong winds and low humidities from Tropical Storm Lee without the benefit of any rain have created conditions ripe for wildfires in Texas. The Texas Forest Service is reporting that approximately 429 homes have been destroyed in the 38 large fires that are currently burning.
On Sunday Texas mobilized additional National Guard Blackhawk helicopters and Texas Intrastate Fire Mutual Aid System (TIFMAS) strike teams as well as a heavy airtanker from South Dakota. At this time dozens of firefighting aircraft are being used, including four heavy airtankers, 15 single-engine airtankers, 12 helicopters, and 13 aerial supervision aircraft. A Type 1 incident management team has been requested to assist with the Bastrop County Complex.
The strong winds are expected to continue over the east half or more of the state along with drier relative humidities into the 10 to 20 percent range across much of the state. High temperatures will be in the upper 70s to lower 80s over a large portion of North Texas to near 100 over Deep South Texas near the Mexico border. The stronger winds are expected to weaken over most of the state Monday night."
wildfires,"A lightning-sparked fire near Las Vegas has grown to nearly 14,000 acres as it burns through bone-dry trees and vegetation.
Officials say the uncontrolled blaze prompted evacuations of more than 500 people and left a blanket of smoke over the city.
U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Julie Thomas says no injuries or damage to structures were reported.
The Clark County Department of Air Quality extended a health advisory for smoke and ground-level ozone through Sunday around Las Vegas.
Some 600 firefighters were battling the blaze with the help of an aerial assault involving five helicopters and five air tankers, but they’re hampered by steep, rugged terrain, temperatures in the upper 90s and wind gusts of up to 40 mph.
The fire advanced to within a mile of homes and Thomas says evacuees will not be allowed to return until crews gain the upper hand."
wildfires,"Thousands of people have fled their homes in northern Alberta where two out-of-control wildfires breached a town's defences and have burned down hundreds of buildings, including the town hall, police station and the radio station.
The RCMP said the Town of Slave Lake is on fire and many homes have burned down. The fire is apparently out of control, engulfing about half of the town.
The fires are in the north and east portion of the town, but winds are slowing down, giving officials hope the fires could be brought under control.
But residents are describing chaos.
""It's horrible; it's just going to spread because houses are ten feet apart,"" Myrna Franklin told CTV Edmonton. ""Our house is out of town, I don't know if it's gone yet or not.""
The Town of Slave Lake has issued a mandatory evacuation order and there have been reports that police are arresting anyone who does not comply.
""We are asking people who are able to travel and have the fuel to get to Athabasca, to leave the community,"" Mayor Karina Pillay said. ""If they do not have transportation or fuel we are asking them to come down to the Northern Lakes College (evacuation centre) and register with us.""
Earlier Sunday, the highways leading out of the town were blocked, forcing officials to tell people to flee to parking lots, the beach or any other wide-open green space.
But one highway is running late Sunday, and residents are now told to get out. Traffic is moving out, but at a slow pace.
There have been no reports of injuries yet, but communication is troublesome as power keeps going out. The local radio station was issuing emergency reports until it succumbed to fire.
There are about 200 firefighters in the town but conditions are lined up against them. Wind gusts of up to 100 kilometres an hour, have made water-bombers ineffective.
The first fire broke out to the southwest of Slave Lake, at about noon local time on Saturday.
The second blaze started to the east of Slave Lake in the Poplar Lane and Mitsue area.
The town has declared a local state of emergency and set up evacuation centres for those without a place to stay."
other,"How Guatemala has dealt with volcanoes over the centuries June 8, 2018 7.33pm AEST When the Fuego volcano near Antigua, Guatemala erupted on June 3, it wasn’t immediately apparent to the people living on its slopes quite how dangerous this event would be. The explosive nature, speed and direction of the eruption were all unexpected. Entire villages were destroyed, and houses covered in thick ash. The death toll stands at at least 99, hundreds of people are missing, and further volcanic activity is hindering rescue efforts. Guatemalans have come together in solidarity with the victims and are responding generously to calls to donate basic necessities and money. Celebrities, foreign governments and aid organisations are all pledging their help. This is the worst volcanic eruption in Guatemala for more than a century, but it’s not an isolated event _ Fuego is an active volcano that erupts with some regularity. As one official put it, at first this seemed like “one of those normal eruptions that people are used to”. Several teenagers died because they wanted to take in the spectacle of the eruption, not realising that this one was different."
drought,"A recent JRC article warns that the extreme drought conditions that affected central and northern Europe's 2018 spring/summer growing season could become the norm within 25 years, and calls for innovative adaptation measures to deal with extremes.
The 2018 spring and summer months were marked by a unique combination of drought conditions in central and northern Europe, and unusually wet conditions in southern Europe.
For instance, Germany was affected by a 6-month drought which lasted the whole spring and summer, while the spring was particularly wet in the Iberian Peninsula.
Both extremes affected crop yields. The droughts resulted into total reductions in the main crop yields of up to 50%.
This was partially offset by southern Europe's yield gains of up to 34%.
This juxtaposition of opposite climate anomalies  _ droughts in the Northern part of Europe and unusually wet condition in the South, sometimes referred to as the ""water seesaw"" _ was  a unique phenomenon of the last 500 years.
 Future climate projections, based on high resolution global models, show that southern Europe is less likely to experience such favourably wet conditions for crop growth in the future.
On the other hand, droughts similar to those of 2018 could become common as early as 2043."
Typhoon,"THE DEATH TOLL from the powerful typhoon that hit the Philippines yesterday has risen to 20.
The BBC reports that Typhoon Nesat is now on its way to China and will reach Hainan Island tomorrow evening or early Friday.
In the Philippines, the clean-up operations have started with emergency services and residents working to restore electricity and resume normal life in the capital Manila.
On Tuesday, the mighty storm slammed Manila and the main island of Luzon, unleashing floodwaters and fierce winds of up to 150km/h. According to the BBC, most deaths occurred in and around the capital.
Another 35 people are unaccounted for, said the Philippine disaster agency. About 108 people were rescued from the floodwaters as residents and local authorities responded quickly _ forcing evacuations of low-lying areas and setting up temporary shelters in safer grounds."
earthquake,"Japan's huge earthquake brought super-modern Tokyo to a standstill Friday, paralyzing trains that normally run like clockwork and stranding hordes of commuters carrying mobile phones rendered largely useless by widespread outages.
The magnitude-8.9 quake off Japan's northeastern coast shook buildings in the capital, left millions of homes across Japan without electricity, shut down the mobile phone network and severely disrupted landline telephone service. It brought Tokyo's train system to a halt, choking a daily commuter flow of more than 10 million people.
""This is the kind of earthquake that hits once every 100 years,"" said restaurant worker Akira Tanaka, 54.
He gave up waiting for trains to resume and decided - for his first time ever - to set off on foot for his home 12 miles (20 kilometers) north of the capital. ""I've been walking an hour and 10 minutes, still have about three hours to go,"" he said.
Tokyo prides itself on being an orderly, technologically savvy, even futuristic city. Residents usually can rely on a huge, criss-crossing network of train and subway lines. But after the mid-afternoon quake, authorities were forced to scan the entire web for quake damage and canceled nearly all train service for the rest of the day.
Tens of thousands of people milled at train stations, roamed the streets or hunkered down at 24-hour cafes, hotels and government offices offered as emergency accommodations."
drought,"A two-decade-long dry spell that has parched much of the western United States is turning into one of the deepest megadroughts in the region in more than 1,200 years, a new study found.
And about half of this historic drought can be blamed on man-made global warming, according to a study in Thursday’s journal Science.
Scientists looked at a nine-state area from Oregon and Wyoming down through California and New Mexico, plus a sliver of southwestern Montana and parts of northern Mexico. They used thousands of tree rings to compare a drought that started in 2000 and is still going — despite a wet 2019 — to four past megadroughts since the year 800.
With soil moisture as the key measurement, they found only one other drought that was as big and was likely slightly bigger. That one started in 1575, just 10 years after St. Augustine, the first European city in the United States, was founded, and that drought ended before the Pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock in 1620.
What’s happening now is “a drought bigger than what modern society has seen,” said study lead author A. Park Williams, a bioclimatologist at Columbia University.
Daniel Swain, a UCLA climate scientist who wasn’t part of the study, called the research important because it provides evidence “that human-caused climate change transformed what might have otherwise been a moderate long-term drought into a severe event comparable to the ‘megadroughts’ of centuries past.”"
wildfires,"There are 285 active fires burning in Alaska that have charred 1.7 million acres, according to the Alaska Interagency Coordination Center. Of those 285 fires, 41 are staffed and the other 244 are being monitored.
The National Interagency Coordination Center reports that the firefighting resources assigned to fires in Alaska include: 106 hand crews, 33 engines, and 29 helicopters.
A fun fact — a Bureau of Land Management Type 3 helicopter (H-173BH) recently completed a four-day trip to an assignment in Alaska. It took off from Rifle, Colorado on June 23 and arrived in Fairbanks June 26. The BLM sent other Type 3 helicopters, one each, from Montana, Wyoming and Utah. Two Forest Service Type 2 helicopters were also recently dispatched from the lower 48 states. In addition, a Type 1 CWN helicopter, Croman 701, an S-61, was also sent to Alaska."
earthquake,"Early on Tuesday morning, a powerful magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck near the coast of Northern Chile. The first seismic activity recorded was located 48km from Huasco at 5.30am (UK time), according to US Geological Survey (USGS). Bolivia, Chile and Argentina were all affected.
The GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences reported that had been some damage and minor landslides but no apparent fatalities. Communities close to the coastline were evacuated, though fortunately, a tsunami was not triggered.
After the initial quake, aftershocks between magnitudes 5 and 6.1 were reported. Many more could be expected in the coming days, and even weeks. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no tsunami threat from the earthquake.
Chile's National Emergency Office of the Ministry of the Interior and Public Security said the event was unlikely to cause major disruption to services or infrastructure, though some places were disturbed. An image shared on social media shows a shaken supermarket after the event.
The quake was revealed to be at a depth of 10km (which equates to around 6.2 miles), and connected to underlying fault movement along a subduction zone."
wildfires,"Portuguese fire-fighters are battling just one wildfire after some 650 firefighters managed to contain two other fires blazing in the country’s north since Friday, rescue services said yesterday.
More than 500 fire-fighters and 75 soldiers used over 100 vehicles, three helicopters and a waterbombing plane to contain a fire raging in Sao Pedro do Sul, in the Viseu region, civil defence services said on its website.
Three people suffered slight injuries on Saturday and a fireman was killed on Monday when a truck transporting him, rolled over.
Another fire raging since Friday in Tabuaco, also in the Viseu area, was contained by 150 fire-fighters, 40 vehicles and two helicopters.
Civil defence services said firefighters were now battling only one “significant” fire, burning since Saturday near the national park of Peneda-Geres in the northwest region of Braga."
Typhoon,"Experts say Typhoon Haiyan was about as strong as it could theoretically get when it swept through the Philippines, killing thousands of people and driving hundreds of thousands from their homes. But intensity limits have been rising over decades past — and climate models suggest they will keep rising over the decades to come, with the potential for bigger and more devastating storms.
""The tragedy of this particular storm is that it reached its limit just about the time it made landfall,"" Kerry Emanuel, a climate scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told NBC News.
Based on satellite imagery, the U.S. military's Joint Typhoon Warning Center estimated that Haiyan's winds reached a sustained peak as high as 195 mph shortly before it made landfall, with gusts rising to 235 mph. Estimates from Philippine weather officials were lower, suggesting that the storm packed sustained winds of 147 mph and gusts of 170 mph when it hit land. Either way, the typhoon ranks among the world's strongest tropical storms and appears to have been more powerful than Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
If the higher estimates are correct, the warning center said Haiyan's maximum strength would exceed that of its previous record-holder: Hurricane Camille, which hit the northern Gulf Coast in 1969 with sustained winds of 190 mph.
""This is at the top end of any tropical system that we've seen on our planet,"" said Bryan Norcross, The Weather Channel's hurricane specialist.
The definition of that top end has been shifting, Emanuel said. He was part of a team of researchers who predicted climate change could make tropical storms more intense, particularly in the Pacific.
""That part of the ocean, the Western Pacific, in November is pretty juicy,"" he said. ""It has a high thermodynamic limit. That limit has been going up in time, perhaps in response to global warming. It's a little hard to say that for sure."" 
Although the maximum intensity of tropical storms is projected to rise, the climate models suggest a scenario that's more complex than merely turning up the dials. ""It doesn't mean there'll be more storms,"" Emanuel said. ""In fact, the weaker storms might be less frequent, but it's not the weaker storms that do the damage. In the end, we're much more concerned about what happens at the high end. It's those guys that do all the terrible destruction."""
earthquake,"A magnitude-5.2 earthquake occurred in central Papua New Guinea, at around 2016 Dec. 18. The epicenter was in northeastern Morobe Province, approximately 67 km (42 miles) northeast of Lae. The tremor occurred at a depth of about 47 km (29 miles). Weak-to-light shaking was probably felt throughout Morobe Province, eastern sections of Eastern Highlands Province, southeastern areas of Madang Province, and western parts of Western New Britain Province. There have been no initial reports of damage or casualties as a result of the earthquake. It could take several hours until authorities can conduct comprehensive damage assessments, especially in remote areas. Aftershocks are possible over the coming days.
Officials may temporarily shut down transportation infrastructure in the tremor zone to check for damage. Minor disruptions could occur during shutdowns, but service will likely resume quickly if officials find no damage. Utility outages are possible, particularly near the earthquake's epicenter and coastal areas of affected provinces. Landslides are possible in mountain areas and could block roads, exacerbating ground transport disruptions."
Typhoon,"Last night (August 10, 2013), Typhoon Utor intensified into a Super Typhoon with winds estimated around 130 knots, or roughly 150 miles per hour. It is pushing to the northwest into the Philippines today, and made landfall around 3 a.m. according to local clocks there on Monday, August 12, 2013. Heavy rain, flash flooding, storm surge over 20 to 30 feet, and damaging winds are likely for the Philippines as the storm bears down on the northern island of Luzon.
Super Typhoon Utor, also known as Typhoon Labuyo in the Philippines, has been going through an eye wall replacement cycle. These cycles typically occur when storms become intense. The eye wall is where the strongest winds are located in the system, and when it becomes so strong, the eye wall typically collapses and reorganizes into another eye wall. During this transition phase, the cyclone becomes slightly weaker. The latest imagery from the storm does not indicate a visible eye, which could be good news for the the island of Luzon. However, the impacts are still expected to cause major problems.
Once Super Typhoon Utor pushes through the Philippines, it is expected to weaken into Category 1 or 2 storm. It will continue to push to the northwest and later impact parts of southeast China, and possibly skirting just to the south and west of Hong Kong. Forecasting the intensity of a tropical cyclone can be difficult, meaning everyone across the region should pay close attention to this typhoon over the next several days. However, it looks like there is potential for the storm to intensify after it pushes over the Philippines and emerges back over warm waters."
Typhoon,"The devastation caused by Hurricane Iota became clearer Wednesday as images emerged showing piles of wind-tossed lumber that used to be homes and concrete walls that were pounded into pieces by the second Category 4 storm to blast Nicaragua’s Caribbean coast in two weeks.
Nicaragua Vice President and first lady Rosario Murillo on Wednesday raised the nation’s death toll to 16. The victims were spread across the country, swept away by swollen rivers or buried in landslides.
Rescuers searched at the site of a landslide in northern Nicaragua, where the local government confirmed four deaths and neighbors spoke of at least 16. A short video from the nation’s emergency management agency showed a massive bowl-shaped mountainside shrouded in clouds that collapsed. Police blocked media access to the site on the Macizo de Pe?as Blancas, a mountain in Matagalpa province, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) north of Managua.
There were seven confirmed dead at the mountain, and the search continued, Murillo said.
Miguel Rodríguez, who works on a ranch next to the site, said he saw at least seven bodies.
“The landslide came with all the dirt, and it became like a river going down. It took all of the little houses that were there. There were five homes, five families,” Rodríguez said.
One home was spared on the other side of the slide. But it was in a precarious position, and rescuers were trying to reach it, he said."
earthquake,"A strong earthquake with a magnitude of 7.0 jolted eastern and northeastern Japan on Sunday, but there were no immediate reports of injuries or damages and no tsunami warning was issued.
The earthquake measured 4 in central Tokyo, Fukushima and their surrounding areas on the Japanese intensity scale, which measures ground motion, according to Japan Meteorological Agency, which uses a different measuring system than the U.S. Geological Survey.
A spokesman for Tokyo Electric Power said there were no reports of any abnormalities at the tsunami-crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plan following the quake.
Some high-speed train services in northern Japan were suspended after the earthquake, but soon resumed operations, Kyodo news reported.
The 7.0 magnitude earthquake, at a depth of nearly 217 miles, was recorded off Japan’s southeastern Izu islands on Sunday at 0527 GMT, the U.S. Geological Survey reported.
The Hawaii-based U.S. Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has not issued a tsunami warning following the earthquake located south-southwest of Hachijo-jima in the Izu islands.
Earthquakes are common in Japan, one of the world’s most seismically active areas. The country accounts for about 20 percent of the world’s earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater.
On March 11, 2011, the northeast coast was struck by a magnitude 9 earthquake, the strongest quake in Japan on record, and a massive tsunami, which triggered the world’s worst nuclear crisis in 25 years since Chernobyl.
The disaster left up to 23,000 dead or missing."
drought,"The drought and the massive displacement of people in the Horn of Africa, in addition to conflict and violence, high food prices, and dwindling resources, has resulted in one of the most dramatic global humanitarian crises.
According to the latest reports by the World Food Programme, some 10 million people are affected by the Horn of Africa's worst drought in 60 years.
Two consecutive rainy seasons have failed, producing a decline of more than 25% of rain for pastoral areas in Somalia, Northern and Eastern Kenya, Southern and Eastern Ethiopia and Djibouti. As a result harvests have failed, livestock mortality has soared, and food and water have become extremely expensive.
The price of food for essential cereals like maize has increased 2,5 times in Eastern Kenya, Eastern Ethiopia and Southern Somalia. Millions of people in the region cannot meet basic survival needs, and emergency levels of acute malnutrition are widespread.
In most areas affected by the drought, malnutrition is affecting over 30% of people, which is more than double the internationally recognized emergency threshold. Those who can are leaving their land and their homes to walk long distances trying to find food and water. Many Somalis are crossing borders to do that. An estimated 3,000 people a day are arriving in Kenya and Ethiopia from Somalia in search for a help.
The crisis is expected to worsen over the coming three to four months. ""If we don't act now, famine will spread to all eight regions of southern Somalia within two months, due to poor harvests and infectious disease outbreaks,"" told Mark Bowden, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Somalia. 
Recovery is not expected until next year, given the expected late and below-average harvests, the depletion of pasture and water and the high prices of food, water, and fuel. This is why the rapid scaling-up of the emergency response is vital to address the humanitarian needs and to prevent further deterioration."
Typhoon,"Typhoon Bolaven caused severe damage to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), leaving 48 people dead and 21,180 homeless, the official news agency KCNA reported on Monday.
As of Sunday, it was confirmed that Typhoon Bolaven, which swept the country last Tuesday and Wednesday with strong wind and heavy rain, has destroyed 6,700 houses across the country, the KCNA said.
The typhoon damaged at least 50,000 hectares of crops and 45,320 hectares of rice paddies. More than 16,730 trees fell down, 880 industrial and public buildings were ruined, and tens of educational and medical service buildings were destroyed, according to the KCNA.
Bolaven, the strongest storm to hit the Korean Peninsula in almost a decade, left 25 people dead or missing and 222 homeless in South Korea, according to the state disaster authority."
earthquake,"At Least 78 Dead After Friday's Earthquake in Indonesia Indonesian rescue teams have pulled more bodies from the rubble of residential and commercial buildings toppled by a strong earthquake that hit Sulawesi island last week, killing at least 78 people, authorities said on Sunday. More than 800 people have been injured. Thousands of others were left homeless. The 6.2 earthquake, with an epicenter 36 kilometers south of West Sulawesi province’s Mamuju district and at a depth of 18 kilometers, struck after 2 a.m. on Friday, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Rescue teams, aided by heavy equipment, have worked around the clock searching for survivors in the hardest-hit city of Mamuju and the neighboring district of Majene. Power supplies and telephone service have improved since Friday, aiding rescue operations. On Thursday, a 5.9-magnitude undersea quake struck the same region, damaging several homes but causing no casualties. Earthquakes, volcanos and tsunamis are common in Indonesia due to its location on the “Ring of Fire,” which is one of the world's most seismically active areas. In 2018, a 7.5-magnitude_earthquake_and a tsunami that followed in Palu on Sulawesi killed more than 4,000 people."
wildfires,"Impossibly fast and ferocious blazes burned a staggering 4.1m acres, making for an‘astonishing and horrifying’ year
On a deadly 24-hour march through the Sierra Nevada in September, the flames of what would become the North Complex fire raced through more than 200,000 acres of dense timber, destroyed a historic schoolhouse and overtook a beloved camp for children with cancer.
Also in its path was the remote settlement of Berry Creek, where Daniel Salazar, 27, found himself once again facing an unprecedented, out of control blaze. Less than two years earlier, Salazar had escaped the Camp fire, which killed his grandparents and 83 others in and around the town of Paradise.
In the Sierra Nevada and across California in late summer and early fall this year, firefighters and residents fought a losing battle against impossibly fast and ferocious blazes.
It was the state’s worst wildfire season on record. By the end of it, the flames had killed 31 people, destroyed or damaged more than 10,000 buildings and burned a staggering 4.1m acres. The North Complex fire was responsible for more than 300,000 acres of scorched land, killing 16 people in its wake."
wildfires,"Catastrophic and unprecedented bushfires in Australia have killed more than 28 people, destroyed hundreds of homes and burned hundreds of thousands of hectares of land, causing massive devastation to wildlife, ecosystems and the environment. The fires come after Australia's hottest, driest year on record. They have led to hazardous air quality in major cities throughout Australia, impacted New Zealand and sent smoke drifting thousands of kilometres across the Pacific to South America.
The fires have led to hazardous air quality in major cities throughout Australia, impacted New Zealand and sent smoke drifting thousands of kilometres across the Pacific to South America. 
The long range transport of smoke reached both Argentina and Chile on 6 January, according to the national meteorological and hydrological services.
Wildfires release harmful pollutants including particulate matter and toxic gases such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and non-methane organic compounds into the atmosphere. The fires have already released approximately 400 megatonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, according to the European Union's Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service (CAMS). On 2 January CAMS saw that the highest concentrations of atmospheric carbon monoxide in the world were over the ‘clean’ South Pacific Ocean, having come from fires in New South Wales. Taking Australia as a whole, carbon dioxide emission hasn’t been particularly high this wildfire season, but emissions from New South Wales are many times higher than the 2003_2018 average."
drought,"Hundreds of millions of people could be left without access to water as climate breakdown causes Asia’s vast glaciers to shrink, researchers have found.
When the rains fail, glaciers in the high-mountain regions around the Himalayas are a life-saver, releasing 36 cubic kilometres of water _ the equivalent of 14 million Olympic swimming pools _ to drought-prone areas every summer.
Glacial loss in the region has been going on for a few decades. However, the rate has increased _ between 2000 and 2016, glaciers were shrinking 1.6 times faster than the period between 1951 to 2007.
“A lot of the climate projections suggest the melt will continue to accelerate,” lead researcher Dr Hamish Pritchard, a glaciologist from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), told The Independent.
Using climate projections, Dr Pritchard believes the glacier melt will start to slow in around 2050.
He added: “As we start to get drought stress hitting, there will be crop failures and a loss of livestock. It could cause people to migrate and if you can’t migrate, it might cause conflict as people will need to fight with their neighbours for food.”
This will hit areas such as the fertile Indus Valley, which has been inhabited by human civilisations for many thousands of years and today feeds 237 million people.
The increase in glacier melt is also causing a glut of water to come down, causing an increase in water consumption."
wildfires,"Powerful winds pushed flames through Southern California canyons early Thursday as an out-of-control wildfire burned near homes and forced residents to flee.
The blaze in Orange County’s Silverado Canyon began late Wednesday as a house fire that quickly spread to tinder-dry brush as gusts topped 70 mph (113 kph).
It exploded in size throughout the night and as the sun came up, an enormous plume of smoke was visible for miles.
Firefighters struggled in steep terrain amid unpredictable Santa Ana winds that have raised fire danger for much of the region.
Orange County Fire Authority Captain Thanh Nguyen said crews were scrambling to stay ahead of flames that jumped major roads.
“We’ve seen the wind change also drastically, so that’s what we’re telling all our personnel to be aware of — that constantly changing wind,” he told CBS LA TV.
Evacuations were ordered for several canyon neighborhoods near the city of Lake Forest and residents of other nearby areas were told to be ready to get out. It was not immediately known how many people were affected or if any homes were damaged.
Numerous studies have linked bigger wildfires in America to climate change from the burning of coal, oil and gas. Scientists have said climate change has made California much drier, meaning trees and other plants are more flammable.
The Bond Fire about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of Los Angeles is burning near the same area of October’s Silverado Fire, which forced tens of thousands of people to evacuate.
The new blaze broke out as Southern California utilities cut the power to tens of thousands of customers to avoid the threat of wildfires during the notorious Santa Anas.
Red flag warnings of extreme fire danger through Saturday were in place because of low humidity, bone-dry brush and the winds, which sweep down from the interior, the National Weather Service said.
Utilities in the populous region began cutting power Wednesday to customers as a precaution to prevent gusts from blowing tree limbs into electrical equipment or knocking down power lines, which have sparked devastating wildfires in recent years.
Southern California Edison cut power to about 15,000 homes and businesses by late Wednesday night and was considering de-energizing lines serving about 271,000 customers in seven counties throughout the windy period, which could last into Saturday."
earthquake,"The most-powerful earthquake in Japan's recorded history struck off the country's northeast coast on Friday, leaving hundreds of people dead, injured or missing.
The 8.9-magnitude earthquake triggered a deadly tsunami that washed far inland, swamping towns, sweeping away a train and sparking massive fires that burned through the night.
The exact death toll was not immediately clear, but there were reports that 200 to 300 bodies were found in the northeastern coastal city of Sendai alone. Another 547 are missing and 798 people were injured, police said.
Kaoru Ishikawa, the Japanese ambassador to Canada, told CBC News that officials haven't determined how many people had died after the devastating quake and tsunami.
""We are trying indeed to check what's going on, but unfortunately the scope of the casualties we don't know yet,"" he said.
Local media are reporting that the death toll is expected to climb and could pass 1,000.
The offshore quake struck at 2:46 p.m. local time at a depth of 24 kilometres about 125 kilometres off the coast, according to the U.S. Geological Survey."

As the red glow of Mount Nyiragongo tinged the Saturday night sky above the lakeside city of about two million, thousands of Goma residents carrying mattresses and other belongings fled the city on foot - many toward the frontier with Rwanda."
wildfires,"In the last 48 hours, 852 homes have been consumed in the flames of Texas wildfires as dozens of blazes continue to sear the drought-plagued state, according to the Texas Forest Service.
Officials say more than 1,000 homes have been destroyed and over 115,000 acres have burned in the past seven days.
The largest wildfire is raging just east of Austin and has burned at least 600 homes and blackened 30,000 acres.
Texas Gov. Rick Perry set aside his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination to focus attention on the emergency at home. He cut short a campaign stop in South Carolina and returned to Texas on Monday. He says his participation in Wednesday's debate in California is a ""fluid situation.""
""I'll be real honest with you, I'm not paying any attention to politics right now,"" Perry said. ""There's plenty of time to take care of that. People's lives and their possessions are in danger. That's substantially more important.""
""I have seen a number of big fires in my life ... this one is as mean looking as I've ever seen,"" he added.
The wall of smoke and flames, 16 miles long and 4 miles wide, has resulted in the evacuation of more than 5,000 people. Five shelters have been set up across the affected area.
The massive wildfire began Sunday afternoon in Bastrop County and is zero percent contained. Texas Forest Service spokeswoman Victoria Koenig said that they expect the wind that has been fueling the flames to die down today, but that it is still a ""tough, tough fire.""
The emergency is not limited to the one fire about 30 miles east of Austin. Roughly 35 other fires are actively burning across this drought-stricken state.
Many Texans prayed Tropical Lee would bring rain, but instead only gusty winds made Texas' most active fire season ever that much worse. The state is experiencing its worst drought since the 1950s.
In the past nine months, Texas has experienced six of the ten largest wildfires in its history and since November 3,523 homes and structures have been lost to the flames, according to the Texas Forest Service."
earthquake,"Turkey earthquake: Search efforts continue for third day as death toll rises Rescue teams in the Turkish port city of Izmir are continuing to search for survivors of Friday's powerful earthquake, as officials say the death toll has increased to at least 64. Sixty-two deaths have been confirmed in Turkey, while two teenagers died on the Greek island of Samos. Dozens of people remain unaccounted for following the quake. A 70-year-old man was pulled from the rubble of a building in Izmir after being trapped for some 33 hours. The US Geological Survey (USGS) said Friday's quake was 7.0 magnitude, but Turkey put it lower at 6.6. The shallow tremor triggered tidal waves that hit coastal areas and islands in both Turkey and Greece."
Typhoon,"Hurricane Hanna makes landfall in Texas Hurricane Hanna battered southern Texas with sustained winds of 75 mph and continued to deliver heavy rain and flash flooding as it moved inland late Saturday. The Category 1 hurricane was moving west at about 8 mph when it made landfall at Padre Island, about 15 miles north of Port Mansfield, around 5 p.m. local time on Saturday. Very heavy rain, strong winds and storm surge impacted the south Texas coast, the worst of it south of Corpus Christi, down to the mouth of the Rio Grande River. While wind and storm surge were notable along the coast during the afternoon, very heavy rain and the potential for widespread flash flooding across the Rio Grande Valley was the biggest concern into Saturday night. Rainfall totals over extreme southern Texas to the Mexico border could lead to dangerous flash flooding. ""Any hurricane is an enormous challenge, this challenge is complicated and made even more severe seeing it is sweeping through an area that is the most challenged area in the state for COVID-19,"" said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. ""We cannot allow this hurricane to lead to a more deadly event by stoking COVID-19 leading to more fatalities."" Abbot said disaster declarations have been made in 32 counties. The National Weather Service in Brownsville reported ""significant structural damage"" in nearby Port Mansfield and a gust up to 83 mph. As is usually the case with land-falling tropical systems, isolated tornadoes are possible along the southern Texas coast through Saturday evening. Hanna will begin to rapidly weaken Saturday tonight and Sunday morning as it moves into northern Mexico. However, it will continue to bring widespread heavy rain and the threat of dangerous flash flooding across the Rio Grande Valley even as the wind speeds go down."

wildfires,"Firefighters in Australia are struggling to contain a massive bushfire on Fraser Island, one of the country's most popular tourist spots.
The fire has been raging through the Unesco World Heritage site off the east coast for six weeks, destroying large swathes of its unique forests.
Travel there was stopped on Friday and guests at the island's largest resort are being evacuated.
It comes as south-east Australia is experiencing a blistering heatwave.
On Fraser Island, just north of Brisbane off the eastern coast of the state of Queensland, there are fears that the high temperatures - forecast to reach up to 34C (93F) in the region in the coming days - will further fuel the blaze.
Firefighters are also being hindered by limited access to the bushfire on the island's remote north.
Authorities say the fire is burning on two fronts, with the island shrouded in smoke."
Typhoon,"Chinese authorities say at least three people have died and 1,200 homes have collapsed as Typhoon Fitow slammed into the country's east coast.
Typhoon Fitow barrelled into China's east coast early on Monday, packing winds of more than 200 kilometres an hour, state media reported.
At least three people were reported killed, all of them near the city of Wenzhou in Zhejiang province, the state broadcaster CCTV said.
One of the victims, 55-year-old Ni Wenlin, died ""after strong wind blew him off a hill"" late Sunday, Xinhua news agency said, citing municipal flood control authorities.
Another person died of electric shock, CCTV said.
In the hard-hit county of Cangnan in Wenzhou, more than 1,200 homes collapsed and damages amounted to hundreds of millions of yuan, China National Radio said.
The threat of the storm has forced about half a million people from their homes in China's Zhejiang province and tens of thousands more in the country's Fujiian province.
Thousands of fishermen were recalled to port and transport services in 35 cities have been affected with the suspension of train services."

Lightning was seen striking around the volcano's ash clouds as it erupted."
wildfires,"The Texas wildfires are adding economic trauma to a state that has already suffered billions of dollars in agricultural damages from an ongoing drought.
Wildfire damages to homeowners could exceed $100 million, a record high for the state, according to Mark Hanna, spokesman for the Insurance Council of Texas.
""The fire losses for 2011 are already the worst on record in Texas,"" said Hanna in a press release. ""These wildfires over the Labor Day weekend will only add to what has become a catastrophic year for Texas.""
This is above and beyond the economic damages of at least $5.2 billion from the drought, according to Travis Miller, professor in the soil and crop sciences department at Texas A&M University. He said the multibillion-dollar figure applies to year-to-date losses as of Aug. 15, and the true cost has ""surely exceeded that by now.""
The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas painted a grim portrait of the drought's impact on agriculture:
""Comments from bankers noted widespread negative impacts of the dry conditions -- low or nonexistent yields for many dryland crops, stress to irrigated crops and very poor pasture conditions,"" the bank said in its second-quarter survey of credit conditions.
The Dallas Fed also noted that many ranchers are sending their cattle to the slaughterhouse earlier than they normally would, pressured by bone-dry pastureland.
""Respondents in several regions mentioned that farmers will likely collect crop insurance money to offset drought losses,"" the bank said. ""There were numerous reports of ranchers liquidating their cattle herds due to inadequate grazing conditions and a lack of surface water.""
Miller said farmers are slaughtering cattle so they don't have to keep feeding them, since the Texas hay harvest has been ravaged by the drought.
""Ranchers are trying to sell their cattle because they don't have feed or hay,"" he said. ""Feed prices are just ridiculous. We're trucking hay in from Missouri. It just doesn't make economic sense to keep feeding cattle at those prices."""
Typhoon,"A powerful typhoon has battered the northern Philippines, toppling power lines and dumping heavy rain across mountains, cities and food-growing plains. At least one man was killed in a landslide and 45 fishermen are missing.
Typhoon Utor, described as the world's strongest so far this year, touched land in the mountainous eastern Aurora province with sustained winds of 109mph (175kmh) and gusts of up to 130mph.
Footage from ABS-CBN TV network showed a woman being swept away by a raging river in neighbouring Isabela province. The woman waved her hands for help as she struggled to hang on to debris while being buffeted by huge waves in the muddy waters. It was not immediately clear what happened to her.
""We have no official report yet, and we do not know if up to this time she has not been rescued,"" said Norma Talosig, a regional civil defence director. She said the woman lived alone in a low-lying area in San Agustin town and had refused to be evacuated.
In mountainous Benguet province, a 22-year-old man died on the way to hospital after he was pulled from a landslide that hit the roadside canal he was clearing, said regional civil defence official Andrew Alex Uy.
The typhoon triggered waves of up to 2.5 metres (8ft) and left scores of fishermen missing.
In northern Pangasinan province, 25 fishermen on board three boats failed to return home, said a provincial police spokesman, Senior Inspector Ryan Manongdo.
Twenty people from the eastern provinces of Catanduanes and Camarines Norte were also unaccounted for. Authorities were hoping they had taken shelter in coves and on nearby islands, said Bernardo Alejandro IV, the regional director for the office of civil defence.
""I hope they're just waiting for the typhoon to pass and will show up as soon as the weather clears,"" he said.
As of Monday afternoon, the typhoon had crossed the Philippines' main northern island of Luzon and was off the country's north-west coast with winds of 87mph and gusts of 106 mph, government weather forecaster Jun Galang said.
He said the typhoon may intensify over the South China Sea as it moves toward China. He said the storm carried a lot of rain but was moving fast, so the rainfall was not concentrated in one area. Utor was forecast to make landfall in Guandong, China, on Wednesday.
About 1,000 residents in the Bicol region of the central Philippines spent the night in shelters, while Aurora province was without power, the national disaster agency said. Radio stations reported roofs being blown off and a covered basketball court was washed away in Dinalungan town.
About 1,100 travellers remained stranded as passenger and cargo ferries were grounded. School classes in towns and cities on the typhoon's path were suspended, including in Manila, the capital. Several domestic flights were cancelled.
Utor, the Marshellese word for a squall line, is the 12th of about 20 storms and typhoons expected to hit the Philippines this year."

earthquake,"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN)At least 36 people died and more than 1,607 have been hospitalized in eastern Turkey after an earthquake rattled the region on Friday evening, according to state broadcaster TRT Haber.
The 6.7-magnitude quake struck near the town of Sivrice, in eastern Elazig province, causing at least 10 buildings to collapse, Interior Minister Sulyman Soylu said.
About 1,607 people were hospitalized, Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management President (AFAD) said on Sunday.
At least 45 people have been rescued from collapsed buildings, AFAD said, adding that 1,521 buildings have been inspected, with 76 found to be collapsed and 645 heavily damaged.
Most of the injured were in Elazig province, the epicenter of the earthquake.
Video from Turkey's IHA Broadcasting Services shows emergency crews rescuing injured people from a collapsed building.
The earthquake caused five buildings to collapse in Elazig and heavy damage to a number of buildings in the area, Minister of Environment and Urbanization Murat Kurum told reporters.
Preliminary reports say the earthquake lasted 40 seconds, AFAD said, adding that 3,699 search and rescue personnel have been deployed.
Fifteen aftershocks have been felt in the wake, with the strongest registering at 5.4 magnitude, Soylu said. The quake struck at a relatively shallow depth of 10 km (6 miles), according to the US Geological Survey (USGS), which enhances the shaking felt at the surface.
About 500,000 people felt strong to very strong shaking, the USGS reported. The earthquake was felt in several other countries, including Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.
The quake interrupted a live broadcast of Edessa TV. Video of the broadcast shows four anchors talking while everything shakes around them.

Typhoon,"American forces were dispatched to the Philippines as the Pacific island country struggled to cope Sunday after one of the most powerful storms in recorded history killed thousands — possibly as many as 10,000 — and wreaked damage far worse than expected.
“At the request of the government of Philippines, Secretary Hagel has directed U.S. Pacific Command to support U.S. government humanitarian relief operations in the Philippines in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan,” the Department of Defense said in a statement late on Saturday night.
The first wave of U.S. force — a team of 90 Marines and sailors — flew to Philippines on Sunday to assist with search and rescue operations and provide air support, the Marines said in a statement.
On Sunday afternoon, U.S. President Barack Obama released a statement saying:
“Michelle and I are deeply saddened by the loss of life and extensive damage done by Super Typhoon Yolanda. But I know the incredible resiliency of the Philippine people, and I am confident that the spirit of Bayanihan (communal work) will see you through this tragedy. The United States is already providing significant humanitarian assistance, and we stand ready to further assist the government’s relief and recovery efforts. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the millions of people affected by this devastating storm.”"
drought,"Drought is a pretty complicated climate extreme to define. Most commonly, it is defined as a precipitation deficit - much less precipitation falls than what is typically expected for a given time period.
But drought can be observed in lots of ways: lack of snowpack, low flows in rivers and streams, dry soils, higher evaporative losses, low lake/reservoir levels, etc. Because the climate varies all the time, it’s a safe assumption to say that all areas experience drought similarly because all areas will see times when precipitation is (or the other water variables) less than average.
But drought is not equally distributed across the U.S. Just as there are climatologically wetter areas and drier areas across the country, the same could be said about the occurrence, frequency, and severity of drought.
So, some might be asking, ""where are the most 'drought-prone' areas?
Drought-Prone States
First, let's look at the states that experience drought most often, according to data from the U.S. Drought Monitor.
The Drought Monitor has been tracking drought conditions across the country since 2000.
Each week, the map is updated with the latest conditions ranging from none, to D0 (which is an “abnormally dry” category), to D1-D4 (which represents increasing severities of drought categories).
How the map is made is a big process that includes analysis of data that encompasses local/regional variability in all the water variables and adds a human component, like impacts."

The quake, which occurred 1918km SSE of Cape Town, hit at around 5.10 pm, according to the US Geological Survey.
With its epicentre at a depth of 10 kilometres, there were no tsunami warnings or reports of damage.
The Koeberg nuclear power plant outside Cape Town and Astron Energy, which owns Caltex, have assured locals that there was no immediate danger and no need to evacuate.
The City of Cape Town has confirmed that they have received reports of tremors but are still awaiting official confirmation.
“Reports have come from numerous suburbs of a tremor that was experienced,” said Charlotte Powell, the head of Public Awareness and Preparedness.
“The Disaster Risk Management Centre is not in a position to provide comment on the apparent seismic event until it has been confirmed by the South African Council for Geoscience.
“We can however confirm at this stage that the tremor did not appear to cause any impact on infrastructure of public safety.
“The City urges the public to report any potential impacts to our Public Emergency Communication Centre by dialing 021 480 7700 from a cellphone or 107 from a landline,” she said.

A total of 275,000 people were displaced by drought this year, 52,000 more than the number who fled conflict, with more than two million threatened by the effects of water shortages.
Reports from the UN and aid charities described farmers lacking seeds to sow, following crop failures in some areas, and livestock dying from the lack of anything to eat。
Afghanistan, where nearly 20 million people rely on farming, has suffered a 45 per cent drop in agricultural output this year as drought hit the country, officials at the ministry of agriculture have said.
At least 120,000 people fleeing the drought arrived in the town of Qala-e-Naw, in Badghis province, in the week leading up to 9 September, the UN humanitarian office reported.
A second UN report, which contained data covering August, said more than 100,000 people may have moved to Herat city for the same reason by the end of last month.
The report estimated 2.2 million Afghans would be affected by the drought this year.
In Qala-e-Naw, where there are an estimated 66,500 drought-displaced people, supplies and humanitarian aid are already insufficient to meet the needs of newly arrived families.
The UN cited an assessment by aid charity World Vision International, which said 99 per cent of people in Badghis thought their food situation was worse or a lot worse than a year ago.
Most farmers lost last season’s harvest and nearly all of them lacked seeds for the new planting season, the UN study said, noting reports saying around 40 percent of livestock have been lost in Badghis due to a lack of pasture and fodder."

drought,"Rivers ravaged by a lengthy drought may not be able to recover, even after the rains return. Seven years after the Millennium drought baked southeastern Australia, a large fraction of the region’s rivers still show no signs of returning to their predrought water flow, researchers report in the May 14 Science.
There’s “an implicit assumption that no matter how big a disturbance is, the water will always come back — it’s just a matter of how long it takes,” says Tim Peterson, a hydrologist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. “I’ve never been satisfied with that.”
The years-long drought in southeastern Australia, which began sometime between 1997 and 2001 and lasted until 2010, offered a natural experiment to test this assumption, he says. “It wasn’t the most severe drought” the region has ever experienced, but it was the longest period of low rainfall in the region since about 1900.
Peterson and colleagues analyzed annual and seasonal streamflow rates in 161 river basins in the region from before, during and after the drought. By 2017, they found, 37 percent of those river basins still weren’t seeing the amount of water flow that they had predrought. Furthermore, of those low-flow rivers, the vast majority — 80 percent — also show no signs that they might recover in the future, the team found."

Over 250 hikers were at the peak when the volcano which lies about 130 miles west of Tokyo, began spewing rocks, ash and thick smoke. Most managed to find their way to safety but 45 remained missing. The Japanese Red Cross immediately dispatched seven Disaster Medical Assistance Teams (DMAT) to the area to care for survivors. They also distributed over 400 blankets and 35 sleeping kits to hikers coming off the mountain."
Typhoon,"Cyclonic storm Tauktae intensified overnight into a ""very severe cyclonic storm"", the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) said. 100 rescue teams have been deployed in Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Goa.
Cyclone Tauktae is ""very likely to intensify further"" during the next 12 hours, the weather office said, adding it may cross Gujarat coast between Porbandar and Mahuva in Bhavnagar district on Tuesday morning.
""Ignore rumours, stay calm and don't panic,"" the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said as it advised people to follow weather updates on radio, TV and newspaper.
Fishermen have been asked not to venture out in the sea."
earthquake,"YEREVAN (RFE/RL) — A major earthquake struck Yerevan and surrounding areas on Saturday, February 13, causing many of their residents to rush out of their homes. The earthquake measured at magnitude 4.7 at its epicenter 8 kilometers southeast of Armenia’s capital, reported the national seismic protection agency. It said tremors were also felt in five of the country’s ten provinces. According to the Armenian Ministry of Health, the quake did not kill or injure anyone. The ministry reported only minor injuries sustained by three people “as a consequence of panic caused by the earthquake.” The Ministry of Emergency Situations urged local residents to stay outdoors shortly after Yerevan was jolted by the quake at around 3:30 p.m. local time. It said it has registered 46 aftershocks. In another statement issued at 7 p.m., the ministry told people to return to their homes. “The analysis of available data shows that the likelihood of a powerful earthquake is low,” it said. The quake appeared to have caused no serious material damage in or outside Yerevan. The Ministry of Emergency Situation reported tentatively that it damaged only one house and three buildings in the city of one million."
wildfires,"A helicopter pilot fighting fires in northern Alberta died on Friday after his chopper went down in the waters of Lesser Slave Lake, not far from where crews have been battling massive wildfires that have forced thousands from their homes.
The male pilot has not been identified, but officials say that he was declared dead at the scene of the crash.
""This is a very tragic event and it does have an impact,"" said Len MacCharles, the incident commander.
""It has an impact on everybody who's involved in putting this community back together. This is a resilient community and they continue to put forth the effort that is needed.""
The chopper was privately contracted by the Alberta government. According to preliminary reports, the helicopter is operated by Campbell Helicopters Limited in Abbotsford, B.C.
Crews from out-of-province have been taking part in the massive fire fighting campaign, and an official with the Transportation Safety Board confirmed that the Bell 212 helicopter was fighting fires in the region.
Just after the crash at 3:30 p.m. local time, an air ambulance was dispatched to the scene, which is near Canyon Creek, about 20 kilometres west of the town of Slave Lake.
The chopper crashed about 30 metres offshore in about two metres of water, and attempts to get to the pilot resulted in some emergency crew members being treated for hypothermia.
Officials with the Alberta's Sustainable Resources, which is in charge of the firefighting effort, said that a full internal review will be undertaken, and that the TSB would be leading the investigation. The cause of the crash isn't known yet."
earthquake,"Earthquake off Russia's Kuril Islands prompts tsunami warning A magnitude 7.5 earthquake has hit off the coast of the Kuril Islands, in eastern Russia. The US Geological Survey has warned the event could ""generate a destructive tsunami"" in the North Pacific. According to the United States Geological Survey the earthquake hit a depth of 59 kilometres (37 miles), around 1,400 kilometres (around 850 miles) northeast of the Japanese city of Sapporo. ""This earthquake has the potential to generate a destructive tsunami in the source region,"" the US Tsunami Warning Center said, adding that it was ""analyzing the event to determine the level of danger""."
wildfires,"In the tinder-dry U.S. West, where campfires, fireworks and even lit cigarettes are banned across public lands, another fire-starting culprit remains free of most restrictions: guns.
This year, officials believe target shooting or other firearms use have sparked at least 21 wildfires in Utah and nearly a dozen in Idaho. Shooting is also believed to have caused fires in Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico.
Officials have been asking the public to scale back shooting as legions of firefighters contend with one of the busiest and most destructive wildfire seasons to ever hit the West.
But many in the region avid proponents of the Second Amendment right to bear arms, so most state lawmakers are hesitant to enact any formal restrictions.
""We're not trying to pull away anyone's right to bear arms. I want to emphasize that,"" said Louinda Downs, a county commissioner in fire-prone Davis County, Utah. ""We're just saying, target practice in winter. Target practice on the gun range. When your pleasure hobby is infringing or threatening someone else's right to have property or life, shouldn't we be able to somehow have some authority so we can restrict that?""
The state's Republican Gov. Gary Herbert took the unusual step of authorizing the top state forest official to impose gun restrictions on public lands after a gunfire-sparked fire. Herbert said his decision doesn't limit gun rights, but is a common-sense response to dry conditions."
other,"At least one person has been killed and four remain missing after an explosion at a chemical plant in Germany.
Officials in the city of Leverkusen say 16 people were injured in the blast, which happened at 09:40 local time (07:40 GMT).
The explosion triggered a fire that took several hours to put out. Plumes of black smoke were seen in the area.
Police have told local residents to stay inside and close windows and doors.
The cause of the blast at the Chempark waste incineration site is not yet known.
""We are deeply saddened by this tragic accident and the death of an employee,"" Lars Friedrich, head of Chempark said.
Rescuers are searching for the missing.
Two of the injuries are thought to be serious, according to Chempark operator Currenta. All of those affected worked at the site."
earthquake,"Magnitude 6.9 earthquake strikes near Ishinomaki, Ishinomaki Shi, Miyagi, Japan Just 11 minutes ago, a 6.9-magnitude earthquake struck near Ishinomaki, Ishinomaki Shi, Miyagi, Japan. The tremor was recorded early evening on Saturday 20 March 2021 at 6:09 pm local time, at an intermediate depth of 73 km below the surface. The event was filed by the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ), the first seismological agency to report it. A second report was later issued by the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC), which listed it as a magnitude 6.9 earthquake as well. Based on the preliminary seismic data, the quake should have been widely felt by almost everyone in the area of the epicenter. It might have caused light to moderate damage. Moderate shaking probably occurred in Ishinomaki (pop. 117,200) located 50 km from the epicenter, Yamoto (pop. 32,000) 57 km away, _funato (pop. 35,400) 68 km away, Shiogama (pop. 59,500) 75 km away, Furukawa (pop. 76,300) 80 km away, Ichinoseki (pop. 63,000) 81 km away, Sendai (pop. 1,063,100) 90 km away, and Mizusawa (pop. 61,300) 98 km away.

Typhoon,"Cyclonic storm Tauktae has intensified and may hit the Gujarat coast by Tuesday, the weather office said on Saturday. Gujarat and Diu coasts are under a cyclone watch. This is the first cyclonic storm this year as India fights a deadly second wave of Covid, which has led to a frightening surge in the country's caseload over the last two months.
The cyclone could also bring ""very heavy to extremely heavy rainfall"" triggering flash floods and landslides over the coastal districts of Kerala, Karnataka and Goa till Sunday. Mumbai can expect showers from Sunday afternoon, officials said.
""Cyclone Tauktae is very likely to intensify further into a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm during next 12 hours and intensify further. It is very likely to move north-northwestwards and reach Gujarat coast in the morning of 18th and cross Gujarat coast between Porbandar and Naliya around 18th May Afternoon / evening,"" the IMD said in its latest update.
More than 50 teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) are on duty in five states - Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Maharashtra. 
The Western Railway said it has cancelled 56 trains either originating or terminating in Gujarat''s Saurashtra region as a precaution.
In Delhi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi reviewed the preparedness of states, central ministries and agencies tasked with dealing with the situation arising out of cyclone Tauktae and asked them to take every possible measure to ensure that people are safely evacuated.
Heavy rain was reported in Maharashtra's coastal Ratnagiri district on Saturday, said K S Hosalikar, head SID, Climate Research and Services, IMD, Pune.
The IMD has issued an ""orange alert""' which means heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely over entire Konkan and hilly areas of western Maharashtra, mainly Kolhapur and Satara on Sunday and Monday, she said.
Visuals showed rescue teams helping residents in Kerala's Kochi, which was hit by heavy rainfall on Friday.
Red and orange alerts have been sounded in various parts. Low-lying areas of the Islands of Lakshadweep are likely to get flooded.
The cyclone is likely to cause heavy rainfall in the coastal districts of Gujarat - pegged at ""extremely heavy"" in Junagadh and Gir Somnath and ""heavy to very heavy rain"" at a few places in the districts of Saurashtra, Kutch and Diu especially Gir Somnath, Diu, Junagadh, Porbandar, Devbhoomi Dwarka, Amreli, Rajkot, Jamnagar, the the India Meteorological Department has said.
Fishermen have been asked to avoid heading to Arabian Sea till Tuesday, tourism activities have been restricted and necessary precautions have been advised for naval operations in anticipation of rough sea.
The cyclone is likely to cause rain - of varying intensity -in parts of Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan too.
The Indian Air Force said it has kept 16 transport aircraft and 18 helicopters in readiness to deal with the situation that could arise out of cyclone Tauktae.
Indian Navy's ships aircraft, helicopters, diving and disaster relief teams are on standby for ""rendering full support to state administrations as the cyclonic storm approaches western coasts,"" the spokesperson has asserted."
earthquake,"A magnitude 6.4 earthquake struck near Petrinja, Croatia, about 30 miles southeast of the capital of Zagreb, on December 29, 2020 at about 6:20 am Eastern Time (12:20 pm local time). Seismic instruments indicate the earthquake originated at a depth of about 6 miles (10 kilometers).
This is the largest earthquake to occur in Croatia since the advent of modern seismic instruments. An earthquake of similar size occurred in 1880 near Zagreb and three magnitude 6 and larger earthquakes have occurred within 125 miles (200 kilometers) of the December 29, 2020 earthquake since 1900. A magnitude 5.6 earthquake on November 27, 1990, about 110 miles (175 kilometers) to the southeast, injured 10 people.
The USGS has posted an event page providing more details. Perceived shaking for the earthquake was very strong. The preliminary PAGER report is Orange for economic losses, indicating significant damage is likely and the disaster is potentially widespread. This event was also felt in Germany, Italy, Hungary and other nearby countries."

The eruption affected over 1.7 million people in Sacatepéquez, Escuintla, and Chimaltenango departments. On 5 June a new violent descent of pyroclastic lava flow led to new evacuations and casualties. A new lahar (volcanic mudflow) formed on 7 June and is descending through the valleys of Santa Teresa, Mineral, and Taniluya. Some 12,407 people have been evacuated and over 4,000 are living in emergency shelters. Urgent shelter, health, food, and WASH needs have been identified."
wildfires,"Wildfires can cause overwhelming stress: The red-orange hues beyond the plumes of smoke seemed so far away, but now threaten the only place some have ever called home. Communities of people told they're not in danger one moment are put on high alert the next. There's not always time to grab family photos, your grandmother's ring or your beloved pets. It only takes a few minutes for fires to grow at an incomprehensible velocity, forcing people out of their homes, says Scott Vest, spokesman for the Red Cross' Ogden, Utah, Northern Chapter. He was stationed in Middletown, California, which is about two hours north of San Francisco, for about two weeks _ just days after emergency officials announced on Sept. 15 that 23,000 people had been displaced by wildfires in Northern California this year. More than 300,000 acres have burned in California so far in 2015, and the fires continue.
“When everything has been destroyed and all you have is a pile of ashes, you don’t really have anything to hold on to,” Vest says.
The notion that there's a specific wildfire season is a thing of the past, says Merritt Schreiber, an associate professor of clinical emergency medicine and director of psychological programs at the Center for Disaster Medical Sciences at the University of California—Irvine Medical Center and School of Medicine_. ""The last few years, fire season has become all year long. It's seriously aggravated by the drought, and the drought is a big stressor in the area,"" says Schreiber, who's also director for pediatric trauma psychology consultation services _there.
When Distress Gets Serious
Grant Marshall, a senior behavioral scientist at the RAND Corporation in Santa Monica, California, has focused his research on trauma resulting from wildfires and other disasters. In August, he and other researchers published a study in EcoHealth that examined the psychological distress faced by 1,387 of the 6,000 households displaced by wildfires that burned 733 square miles in Apache County, Arizona, from May through June 2011.
""We found relatively high rates _ 35 percent _ of people who were still experiencing emotional distress that could be indicative of a mental health problem even months after the event took place,"" Marshall says.
Those experiencing such an event might feel more irritable, nervous or anxious or even depressed, Vest says._ They might have detailed memories of the evacuation or witnessing the fire raging toward their community.
Schreiber adds there are two trajectories people tend to take when they've experienced a wildfire or similar disaster that displaces them: distress with resilience and distress without resilience.
""Many people have distress, and many people who have distress are going to have resilience. They're going to bounce back to how they were doing before in a relatively short period of time,"" Schreiber explains, adding that the other group who can't seem to deal may have a greater risk for developing a condition such as _depression or post-traumatic stress disorder.
How a person responds may depend on whether he or she had a chance to prepare to evacuate their home, whether the evacuation was during daylight or in the middle of the night and if there was an opportunity to collect belongings and pets."
wildfires,"Firefighters in New Mexico and Colorado are battling wildfires that have spread quickly in all directions, forcing hundreds of people to flee from their homes across both states.
In Colorado, at least 18 structures, including homes, have been destroyed, while one person is missing and feared dead, according to authorities. Flames have torched more than 30 square miles in two days.
""If you talk about worst-case scenario, this is our worst-case scenario,"" Larimer County Sheriff Justin Smith said.
Hundreds of residents have been evacuated. Authorities sent at least 2,575 evacuation notices to phone numbers but it wasn't clear how many residents had to leave, according to ABC News Station KMGH-TV in Denver. About 500 people had checked in at Red Cross shelters, according to The Associated Press.
Some residents said they didn't receive any notice and their only warning was hearing the fire coming toward their doorsteps.
""It was terrible. It sounded like a hurricane,"" said Sandra Mullen, according to KMGH. ""I think everything will be gone. My husband is 78 and I'm 75, so when you're that old, it's too hard to start over.""
Resident Joanne Hertz said, ""It looked like Armageddon. I have absolutely no clue if my house is still standing.""
Resources are spread thin in Larimer County as other western states need tankers, helicopters and ground crews to battle their own wildfires, sheriff's spokesman Nick Christensen told KMGH."
Typhoon,"A powerful typhoon was ripping through Japan on Sunday and authorities were warning people to brace for heavy winds and rain in areas that include those devastated by a previous storm.
Many flights were canceled at major airports throughout Japan, including Tokyo’s Narita and Haneda, as Typhoon Trami approached. The storm destroyed power lines on the southwestern islands of Okinawa on Saturday.
In its projected course are regions hit earlier this month by Typhoon Jebi, which caused landslides, floods and shuttered a major airport. The strongest typhoon to hit Japan in 25 years, Jebi caused 11 deaths in and around Osaka.
Trami was expected to hit Tokyo late Sunday, and slam northern Japan on Monday.
In July, heavy rain in western Japan killed 221 people, setting off landslides and flooding."
Typhoon,"Hurricane Sally made landfall near Gulf Shores, Alabama in the early hours of Wednesday morning as a Category 2, bringing a storm surge and more than 2 feet (60cm) of rain.
The northern eyewall brought hurricane-strength winds across the Gulf coast from Pensacola Beach in Florida through to Dauphin Island, Alabama.
Almost 650,000 customers are without power across three states.
The slow speed of the system, moving at just 3mph, and the amount of rain falling, could seriously exacerbate flooding, which is already widespread across the region. A flash flood emergency remains in place until 5.30pm CDT and people are advised to not travel unless fleeing an area subject to flooding.
Pensacola, Florida, currently has between three and four feet of water in its streets and more rainfall is expected. Much of downtown is impassable, and part of the brand-new Three Mile Bridge to the city of Gulf Breeze is now ""missing,"" according to the National Weather Service (NWS) forecast office in Mobile. A barge has reportedly also struck the bridge.
FEMA has pre-positioned more than 1.8 million meals and 1.5 million bottles of water in response to the hurricane. 
It is the eighth named storm to reach landfall on American shores this year, reportedly breaking a 104-year old record last set when seven storms landed in 1916’s storm season."
wildfires,"Australia is currently engulfed with smoke. The wildfires that the country is experiencing at the moment are a result of man-induced global warming.
There have been quite a few human casualties and the bushfires have burned nearly 5 million hectares of land. Australia saw the hottest and driest season this year with the temperature reaching almost 50 degrees celsius in the last month.
The bushfires are also having an extreme effect on the wildlife of Australia. According to reports over 8,000 koalas, which is approximately 30 per cent of the total population in NSW's mid-North Coast region have been lost to fire.
Ecologists from the University of Sydney believe, over 480 million birds, animals and reptiles have already been lost because of the fires.
Netizens have also taken to the internet to share images and videos of the bushfires to show the world what exactly is happening in Australia and it is a heart-breaking sight."
wildfires,"Last week featured one of the worst June heat waves in decades across the West, shattering hundreds of daily records, as well as several all-time hottest temperatures recorded for the month.
Death Valley soared to a blistering 128 degrees, and Denver saw a rare hat trick of three 100-degree days in a row.
Tucson saw eight straight days of temperatures 110 degrees or higher, breaking the record for the number of consecutive days above that barrier and making it the city's hottest week. Phoenix endured a record-setting six straight days of temperatures 115 or higher.
All of this heat contributed to a high fire danger which came to fruition over the weekend when multiple blazes broke out in several Western states including California, Colorado, Arizona and Oregon.
The Willow Fire in Monterey County, which forced evacuations Friday, continued to burn over the weekend sending smoke billowing into the Bay Area.
The Cow Fire in Shasta County also prompted evacuation orders, and at one point Sunday required a large air tanker to be diverted off the Willow Fire for increased firefighting efforts.
On Monday, 7 million people were under red flag warnings across six Western states where the combination of hot temperatures, wind gusts to 40 mph and bone-dry humidity lead to a critical fire threat.
Las Vegas was included in the risk zone for the fire danger.
The most recent heat wave was focused over portions of the Four Corners, desert Southwest and Southern and Central California. Next week, however, the area of most exceptional heat could park over northern California and the Pacific Northwest."
Typhoon,"China was on its highest alert for Typhoon Fitow Sunday, with tens of thousands evacuated as the storm was set to slam into the east coast as early as Sunday night.
The National Meteorological Centre issued a red alert for the storm, saying it was expected to make landfall in China late Sunday or early Monday somewhere between the south of Zhejiang province and the north of Fujian province.
The storm, which the centre classified as ""strong"" with winds up to 151 kilometres (94 miles) an hour, was located Sunday afternoon about 280 kilometres southeast of the city of Wenzhou in Zhejiang and moving at a speed of 18 kilometres an hour.
Zhejiang has so far evacuated more than 130,000 people ahead of the expected landfall, state news agency Xinhua said.
""We must not leave anybody in danger,"" said Li Qiang, the provincial governor.
He urged local authorities to increase inspections of dams and reservoirs as well as safety checks of chemical plants and other important facilities, Xinhua reported.
Fitow was expected to bring heavy rain and strong winds, Xinhua added, quoting the weather centre as saying it was unusual for a typhoon to come ashore in China's southeast during October. It urged authorities and residents to be especially alert.
Chinese maritime authorities also issued red alerts, warning of storm tides and waves kicked up by Fitow.
Fishermen were urged to return to port and local authorities were told to prepare harbour facilities and sea walls for high tides.
Fitow, named after a flower from Micronesia, comes just two weeks after Typhoon Usagi wreaked havoc in the region.
The storm, which Xinhua described as the 23rd to hit China this year, passed through Japan's southern Okinawan island chain, forcing flight cancellations and causing power outages.
Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau issued a warning over the storm Sunday morning as it was
barrelling past the north of the island.
A total of 103 international flights were cancelled in Taiwan while 14 flights were delayed. Seventeen ferry services between Taiwan and offshore islands were also terminated.
Some 670 mountain climbers were advised to scrap their plans as the bureau forecast torrential rain in mountainous areas in the north and northeast.
The Taiwan weather bureau said the typhoon had brought up to 400 mm (16 inches) of rainfall although it was not likely to make landfall on the island.
Taiwan's military has ordered more than 20,000 troops on standby."

Interior Minister Rui Pereira told a news briefing the situation in the arid northern woodlands ""is comparable to a true theatre of war"".
He also praised firefighters for their bravery after two died and several were badly injured in forest fires this week.
He said the government had activated the European Union's Civil Protection Mechanism to get additional firefighting equipment and was doing all in its power to prevent wildfires from spreading further. Scorching heat and winds were ""particularly adverse"" this year, he said.
In total, fire brigades were combating more than 30 fires in Portugal on Thursday afternoon.
Officials said some 120 firemen with 20 trucks and four aircraft were working to put out the flames that threatened the homes of those evacuated in Vilar de Soente, in the Peneda-Geres reserve not far from the border with Spain's Galicia region.
In the mountainous Serra de Estrela nature reserve, the Tour of Portugal international cycling event was forced to shorten the day's route by 40 km (25 miles) due to fires in the area, organisers said.
Television footage showed airplanes and heavy helicopters dumping tonnes of water on the burning forest while police and firefighters blocked roads nearby, with flames arching above the melting asphalt. Pereira said hundreds of fires were registered every day in the country. Firefighters put out 95 percent of them the same day.
Many districts in the north have raised the fire threat level to the highest possible this week. Hundreds of troops were deployed to help the fire brigades.
Forest fires are common in Portugal and southern Europe in the summer months, caused by high temperatures, recklessness and often arsonists. The area of the forest destroyed by wildfires so far lags last year, which was a four-year record."

The company, which belongs to Israeli shipping magnate Eyal Ofer, said it was working to establish what had happened.
It added that the vessel was now ""sailing under the control of her crew"" and heading to a safe location with a US naval escort.
The UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) naval authority said it was investigating the incident, which occurred near the Omani island of Masirah, and confirmed that ""coalition forces"" were assisting the vessel.
The tanker had been travelling in the northern Indian Ocean to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from Dar es Salaam in Tanzania.
According to Zodiac Maritime, it had no cargo on board at the time of the incident."
earthquake,"7.7-magnitude earthquake generates small South Pacific tsunami NOUMEA: A 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck in the South Pacific on Thursday (Feb 11), generating a small tsunami that caused no damage to island nations in the region before authorities gave the all clear. The quake struck at just after midnight on Thursday local time (9.20pm on Wednesday, Singapore time) about 415 kilometres east of Vao in New Caledonia at a depth of 10 kilometres, according to the US Geological Survey. The US government's NWS Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said ""hazardous tsunami waves"" were forecast for some coasts. It said waves reaching between 0.3 and one metre above the tide level were possible for Fiji, New Zealand and Vanuatu. A wave of 0.3 metres struck Fiji, according to the Twitter feed of the island nation's seismology department. However, Fiji Seismology later cancelled its tsunami warning. ""The seismology observatory upon its assessments has now verified and confirmed the cancellation of the warning and 'all clear information' (is) issued to the whole Fiji group,"" it said. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology confirmed in a tweet that a tsunami had been generated. The bureau warned of a threat to Lord Howe Island, which is about 550 kilometres east of Australia's mainland, but said there was no need for evacuations. Locals in the Vanuatu capital Port Vila said they felt the quake but there was no damage from either the shake or subsequent waves. The New Zealand National Emergency Management Agency warned of ""strong and unusual currents"" in northern coastal areas but said there was no tsunami risk. ""There isn't a threat to land so we haven't issued a tsunami alert,"" the disaster agency's acting director Roger Ball told Radio New Zealand. He advised those in affected areas to ""stay out of the water and stay off the beaches"" but said the danger posed was not enough to warrant a nationwide warning. ""Waking everybody up at 4:00 or 5:00 am in the morning with emergency mobile alerts we didn't feel was a proportionate response,"" he said. There were no initial reports of casualties or damage from the tsunami or the quake, which was initially recorded by USGS at magnitude 7.5 before being revised to 7.7. The Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", where tectonic plates collide, experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity. In 2018, a 7.5-magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami on Indonesia's Sulawesi island left more than 4,300 people dead or missing. A 9.1-magnitude quake struck off the coast of Indonesia's Sumatra island in 2004, triggering a tsunami that killed 220,000 throughout the region. The death toll included around 170,000 in Indonesia - one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history."

Warnings of Tsunami Though there were no casualties reported during the earthquake. A more significant warning is knocking at the door. The authorities are predicting a tsunami which got its cancellation later. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre (PTWC) said tsunami waves could hit within 1000 km of the epicentre of the earthquake. But after some time, the authorities denied it and said quakes of this magnitude made the Tsunami go far away from the epicenter. In addition to that, they added that only tiny tsunami waves were present. Therefore, there is no threat to Russia, as of now."

More than 1,000 people had to be evacuated on Monday night from villages in the province of Vastmanland, about 140 kilometers (87 miles) northwest of the capital Stockholm. Thousands more locals have since been put on alert and told to prepare to leave their homes.
A truck driver was also hospitalized with severe burns after his vehicle was surrounded by flames.
""It was thick with smoke and I heard the forest was blazing. They were water bombing just above where we live,"" Tommy Persson, one of the evacuees, told Swedish news agency TT.
Emergency services estimate it could take some weeks to bring the fire under control.
Firefighters are currently being aided by 13 helicopters doing water drops over the affected area, but thick smoke and difficult terrain have hampered their efforts. Italy and France have sent firefighting aircraft to help fight the blaze.
It's unclear what sparked the fire - one of the largest seen in Sweden in recent decades. Hot, dry weather conditions are making it tricky for firefighters to bring the flames under control."

The 7.3-magnitude quake struck shortly before midnight on Saturday and cracked walls, shattered windows and set off a landslide in Fukushima, the area closest to the epicentre. The Japan Meteorological Agency said the quake was believed to be an aftershock from the 9.0-magnitude Mar 11, 2011 earthquake that set off a tsunami and the world's worst nuclear accident in 25 years. The agency warned of aftershocks for several days."
earthquake,"Powerful 7.7 earthquake strikes in Caribbean between Cuba and Jamaica A magnitude 7.7 earthquake in the Caribbean Sea, followed by a series of strong aftershocks, shook a large stretch from Florida to Mexico on Tuesday but apparently caused no major damage or casualties.  The initial tremor struck at 2:10 p.m. Eastern Time and was centered 86 miles northwest of Montego Bay, Jamaica, and 87 miles west-southwest of Niquero, Cuba, the U.S. Geological Survey said. The quake's depth was relatively shallow at 6 miles beneath the surface. The USGS initially estimated the quake's magnitude at 7.3 before upgrading it to 7.7. The ensuing aftershocks so far have topped out at a magnitude 6.1. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said any tsunami threats from the earthquake have passed and no other ones are foreseen. There have been no immediate reports of damage or injuries. However, the earthquake caused very strong to severe shaking in portions of far western Jamaica, capable of moderate to heavy damage, the USGS said. It also said moderate shaking was felt on Grand Cayman Island, while light shaking was reported on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. Other affected countries include the Bahamas, Haiti and Honduras. Gov. Carlos Joaquín González of Mexico’s Quintana Roo, which is home to Cancun, Tulum and other popular Caribbean beach resorts, said the earthquake was felt in multiple parts of the state. In total, five states in Mexico felt the tremor, the country's seismological service reported. The quake was also felt as far away as South Florida, and buildings in Miami were evacuated as a precaution. Stenette Davis, a psychiatrist at a Cayman Islands hospital, said she saw manhole covers blown off by the force of the quake, and sewage exploding into the street, but no more serious damage."
wildfires,"The brush fire is under control, but a crew stayed on scene well into the night, just to make sure it stays down.
As the sun went down on Pittsburg, firefighters gained control of what they called an unusual fire.
""It's burning on top of the water. Fire on water,"" said George Laing from the Contra Costa Fire Protection District.
Flaming tule reeds, eight to 10 feet high, burned over a boggy marsh filled with three to four feet of water. Firefighters relied on catwalks to get to the flames, but when the catwalks caught fire they had to slog through the marsh.
The Pittsburg power plant is currently non-operational. So there was no threat of a major power outage. The real threat came from transmission lines above.
""The PG&E transmission lines contain high voltage and in some cases smoke and particulate matter burning from fires can cause arcing between the lines and down to the ground, and that was a concern,"" said Laing.
Willow Pass Road was closed for about two hours preventing people from getting to work and home.
""Last summer we had the other side of the road catch on fire and we had pretty much the same situation and we were stuck out here. It was around the Fourth of July,"" said Steve Sebastian, a truck driver.
But that was July when vegetation is expected to be dry.
""We're all surprised at aggressive fire behavior that causes a three-alarm fire in the tules in March. We're concerned about the kind of fire behavior we're going to get this summer,"" said Laing.
This fire consumed a lot of fresh green grass and by July it'll all be dead, so another fire like this could spread a lot faster and jump the roads. Investigators are still trying to figure out the cause of this fire.
Capt. Robert Marshall said the blaze threatened a few power lines connected to the nearby NRG Energy, Inc. natural gas power plant but was not a threat to any structures at the plant, including large tanks previously used for fuel storage.
No injuries were reported."
wildfires,"A fast-growing wildfire along the Pacific Coast Highway northwest of Los Angeles nearly doubled in size Friday and was threatening more than 4,000 homes as crews battled strong winds, tinder-dry conditions and record-breaking temperatures.
The Springs Fire had burned more than 28,000 acres of rugged, brush-covered terrain by late afternoon and was 20% contained, the state's fire agency reported.
Forecasters said a weekend of increased humidity should help teams fighting the early-season blaze make gains Saturday.
""It's a total turnaround from what we had,"" said Kurt Kaplan, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Oxnard. ""It should be a much better day for firefighters tomorrow.""
At midday Friday, the temperature hit a record 96 in Camarillo, where the blaze began, about 50 miles north of Los Angeles.
Thousands of residents had already evacuated the Ventura County fire, including 118 families ordered from a premier Navy base because of heavy smoke after flames jumped the scenic highway.
The fire began Thursday during the morning rush hour near U.S. 101, which is the major commuter route into Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley. After reaching the coast overnight, the fire headed back inland Friday.
The fire had damaged 15 homes and destroyed at least 25 outbuildings and other property by midday. Large animals and livestock were being taken to the county fairgrounds.
No operations were affected Friday morning at the sprawling Naval Base Ventura County, which was already operating on an ""essential mission"" basis. The base has a population of more than 19,000 personnel and operates two runways, a sea-test range and deep-water port.
The evacuation order only affected the San Miguel housing unit for the Point Mugu air station. ""This is due to smoke, rather than fire, concerns,"" public affairs officer Kimberly Gearhart announced on the base's Facebook page."
earthquake,"Earthquake injures 3 in Argentina; tremor also felt in Chile Authorities say a 6.4-magnitude earthquake struck in northwestern Argentina near the border with central Chile, injuring at least three people BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- A 6.4-magnitude earthquake struck in northwestern Argentina near the border with central Chile, injuring at least three people, authorities said Tuesday. Two children and an adult were hospitalized in San Juan province in Argentina after the quake hit just before midnight Monday, provincial Gov. Sergio U_ac said. The shaking caused the collapse of a house, damage to roads and some other buildings in several cities, as well power and water cuts, he said. The U.S. Geological Survey said the epicenter was 27.6 kilometers (17 miles) southwest of the Argentine town of Porcito and struck at a depth of 14 kilometers (nearly nine miles). The quake was followed by a magnitude 5.0 aftershock about 15 minutes later and then at least five more strong aftershocks in the next hour ranging from magnitude 5.3 to 4.8, the USGS said. Strong shaking was felt in Chile’s capital, Santiago. Chilean officials said there were no immediate reports of damage."
Typhoon,"An ominous tweet appeared on a historic North Carolina community’s Twitter feed about 2 a.m. Friday.
It came as rivers swelled, tides crested and the rain wouldn’t stop. And that’s when people found themselves trapped in their homes as the water rose.
“WE ARE COMING TO GET YOU,” the tweet said. “You may need to move up to the second story, or to your attic, but WE ARE COMING TO GET YOU.”
More than 360 people had been rescued by midafternoon Friday, hours after then-Hurricane Florence swept through, but another 140 were still waiting for help, city spokeswoman Colleen Roberts told The Associated Press.
Crews from the city and the Federal Emergency Management Agency were working with citizen volunteers to get people to dry ground, Roberts said. There had been no reports of injuries or fatalities, though most of the city was without power and thousands of buildings had been damaged, she said.
Sixty-seven-year-old Sadie Marie Holt was among those rescued Friday.
Holt, who has diabetes and clogged arteries, said she stayed for doctor’s appointments that were canceled at the last minute. She tried to row out of her neighborhood Thursday night with a boat that was in her yard after her home began to flood, but had to retreat because of the poor conditions."
wildfires,"The province is escalating the fight against an out-of-control wildfire threatening Zama City in northwest Alberta.
""We do have a Type 1 team mobilizing to the site,"" said Heather Hawkins with Sustainable Resource Development. ""They are the most experienced and most well trained fire managers.""
The fire is estimated at more than 100,000 hectares, but heavy smoke makes it difficult to be more precise, she said.
Firefighters are holding a fire about 10 kilometres from the oil and gas hamlet of Zama City, about 930 kilometres northwest of Edmonton.
About 130 people were evacuated from their homes to hotels and a school in High Level, Alta., late Tuesday night when winds picked up and began pushing the fire south towards the hamlet.
""The high pressure ridge that was sitting over northern Alberta started to break down which means we had some strong winds start to pick up,"" said SRD spokesperson Rob Harris. ""That's what really fanned the fires.""
SRD recommended the hamlet evacuate immediately and Mackenzie County agreed to issue a mandatory evacuation order, he said.
Zama resident Janet Hackett said she got a sense around 4 p.m. Tuesday that people would have to leave. The family had their bags packed and ready to go when the evacuation order was issued.
""The town was becoming really, really smoky, and the skies were really red and grey, so we knew that it was getting pretty intense,"" she said.
The family then drove along a dirt road for two hours to reach High Level.
Hackett's husband, Richard, is Zama's fire chief. He returned to the hamlet Wednesday morning."
Typhoon,"Hurricane Irma is the strongest Atlantic basin hurricane ever recorded outside the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. It lasted as a hurricane from August 31 until September 11. The storm, which stretched 650 miles from east to west, affected at least nine US states, turning streets into rivers, ripping down power lines, uprooting trees and cutting off coastal communities.
On September 6, Hurricane Irma left a string of small Caribbean islands devastated. The eye of the hurricane passed over Barbuda, damaging about 95% of the buildings on the island.
The hurricane hit southwest Florida on September 10, battering the state's lower half and leaving a trail of tornadoes and storm-surge flooding as its core slowly moved inland.
The massive storm triggered evacuation orders for 5.6 million people before it made two landfalls.
On Monday, Irma was downgraded to a tropical storm as it lumbered through Georgia to parts north.
By Tuesday, Irma had left a trail of deadly devastation throughout the Southeast, flooding major cities including Jacksonville, Florida, and Charleston, South Carolina, and leaving millions without power."

The quake was said to be long and violent, with some roads and bridges reported to be damaged.
One woman was reported to have been killed and a young child injured when a house collapsed in Cagayan de Oro city, on the main southern island of Mindanao, officials said."
other,"President Joe Biden says US forces will end their combat mission in Iraq by the end of this year, but will continue to train and advise the Iraqi military.
The announcement came after Mr Biden held talks with Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi at the White House.
There are currently 2,500 US troops in Iraq helping local forces counter what remains of the Islamic State group.
Numbers of US troops are likely to stay the same but the move is being seen as an attempt to help the Iraqi PM.
The US presence in Iraq has become a major issue since top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani and the leader of an Iran-backed Shia Muslim militia were killed in a US drone strike in the capital Baghdad last year.
Political parties aligned to Iran have demanded the withdrawal of all forces from the US-led global coalition against IS, despite the continuing threat posed by the Sunni jihadist group.
Shia militias have meanwhile been accused by the US of carrying out hundreds of rocket, mortar and drone attacks on Iraqi military bases that host coalition forces in an apparent attempt to pressure them to leave.
For the US president, the announcement marks the end of another war that began under former President George W Bush. This year he said US troops would leave Afghanistan."
Typhoon,"Hurricane Delta, which made landfall about 11 miles (about 18 kilometers) from where the devastating Hurricane Laura hit a little more than a month earlier, cost 2.9 billion in the United States and was linked to six deaths in the U.S. and Mexico, according to a report from the National Hurricane Center.
The report released Tuesday details the hurricane’s origins, trajectory and things such as wind speed and storm surge when it made landfall in southwestern Louisiana.
The Center releases similar reports on every named storm that hits during a season. The reports on some of the 2020 season’s most devastating hurricanes - including Laura, Iota and Zeta - have yet to be published.
In the United States, two people died as a direct result of Delta — a 19-year-old woman and a 49-year-old man who both drowned in rip currents near Destin, Florida — and there were two indirect deaths associated with electrocutions and fires. In Mexico, there were two indirect deaths — an electrocution and a fall — linked to the hurricane.
The Center classifies deaths as direct or indirect. Direct deaths are those considered directly tied to the storm such as drowning in storm surge or being in a house that collapses from wind. Someone who dies of a heart attack during a storm or is electrocuted by a downed power line, for example, is considered an indirect death.
The hurricane came ashore as a Category 2 storm with winds of 97 miles per hour (156 miles per hour) and produced a storm surge that got up to nine feet (2.7 meters) in some areas east of where it made landfall near Creole, the report said. While Laura’s earlier damage came through devastating winds, Delta produced huge rain totals in some areas particularly between Lake Charles and Alexandria. Nearly 18 inches of rain fell in LeBleu Settlement northeast of Lake Charles, the report said.
The Center also released a report Tuesday on Hurricane Marco. That storm, which came days before the much more destructive Laura made landfall on August 27, was originally thought to have made landfall at the mouth of the Mississippi River on Aug. 24 based on satellite imagery. But in the report, the Center said further research suggests it stayed just south and did not actually make landfall. There were no reports of casualties linked to the storm and only minor damage.
The 2020 Atlantic hurricane season set multiple records while producing a record 30 named storms. There were so many that the list of 21 conventional names was exhausted and the Greek alphabet was used for only the second time. The season also saw the second-highest number of hurricanes on record after 13 of the storms reached hurricane status."
drought,"Millions of people in the Horn of Africa are facing severe shortages of food as the worst drought in the region for six decades withers crops and kills livestock, as the BBC's world affairs correspondent Mike Wooldridge reports.
""I had a herd of 200 cows. I took them to Ethiopia when the drought started. All the cows I had taken there died and I came back without a single cow.""
That story told by a resident of Wajir district in northern Kenya might not immediately appear to symbolise the humanitarian emergency increasingly gripping swathes of East Africa and the Horn of Africa - in the way that the rapidly growing number of acutely malnourished children trekking out of Somalia does.
But the distress being experienced by pastoralist communities across the affected region also goes a long way in explaining the severity of the current drought, its impact and the limits to the strategies people use to try to protect their livelihoods in such circumstances.
The Wajir cattle herder acted when he saw the grazing for his precious animals drying up.
But in the area of Ethiopia he took them to there turned out to be no greater chance of saving them. They started dropping dead, he says, one by one.
Aid officials estimate that up to half a million cattle have been lost in Ethiopia this year.
It often takes pastoralists at least two years to recover from a severe drought, particularly where it means building up a milking herd again.
This year's drought has hit hard when many people have not yet recovered from the last serious drought in 2009.
And the more marginalised the communities - and many of them are - the more likely people are to be pushed over the edge."
drought,"Namibia is facing a ""natural disaster"" because of poor rains, President Hage Geingob says.
He has declared a state of emergency - the second in three years - over the situation, mobilising all government agencies to respond to the drought.
The lack of rain has already left 500,000 people - one in five Namibians - without access to enough food, the government says.
The sparsely-populated country has seen a succession of droughts since 2013.
The government had set aside 40m (30m) to buy food and water tanks, and to transport livestock to and from grazing areas.
Prime Minister Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila has appealed for international help.
""We... call on all Namibians and development partners to assist in any way possible, so that we provide to our people who are affected, as well as the livestock,"" she said in the national assembly.
At least 60,000 domestic animals have died in the past six months.
Those affected are facing severe food shortages following the prolonged drought, the prime ministers's office, which is coordinating the response, has said.
President Geingob blamed a poor rainy season, which is usually comes between January and March, for being behind the problem.
Rivers have dried up in the north of the country, and people are depending on food and water relief from the government, journalist Tuyeimo Haidula told the BBC.
Livestock have been worst affected by the drought, she said.
Information and Communication Minister, Stanley Simataa, has asked farmers to reduce livestock to reasonable numbers that they can build when the situation changes, national broadcaster NBC reports.

Typhoon,"Chinese state media report that the death toll in the northeast of the country has risen to 37 since floods began on August 10.
Liaoning province reported 12 flood-related deaths after downpours on Friday and Saturday, 14 were killed in Jilin province, and officials in Heilongjiang province said 11 had died, according to the official Xinhua news agency.
Xinhua reported that the flooding in the area was the worst in several decades, displacing some 140,000 people and destroying more than 2,500 houses. Railways and highways were cut off and bridges damaged.
Losses have been put at 7.13 billion yuan ($1.17 billion, 874 million euros).
Meanwhile, Southern China is recovering after being battered by Typhoon Utor last week. Xinhua said 10 people were dead and four others missing in the southern province of Guangdong and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
Flood of the century
Across the border in Russia, flooding has also caused widespread devastation in the country's far east, though no casualties have been reported so far.
The floods have been declared a natural disaster in the worst-affected regions of Amur and Khabarovsk. Authorities say the floods are the worst in more than a century.
Tens of thousands of emergency services workers and civilians have been struggling to contain the waters of the Amur River on Russia's border with China. The minister of Regional development, Viktor Ishayev, said more than 17,000 people had been evacuated and that this figure could rise to as many as 100,000.
""The damage is extensive, but the most significant achievement is there have been no casualties ... we cannot relax, there is still a lot of work to be done,"" Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a televised address on Saturday.
The Interfax news agency reported that Prime Minister Dimitry Medvedev had earmarked 3.2 billion rubles (73 million euros, $97 million) for the affected regions, though the bill for damage is expected to be much higher.
The flooding occurred after massive rains since the end of July caused the Amur River, and one of its tributaries, the Zeya, to burst their banks."

Typhoon,"U.S. forecasters say Hurricane Iota has strengthened to a catastrophic Category 5 storm as it nears landfall with Nicaragua.
In its latest report, the National Hurricane Center says Iota is closing in on Nicaragua, where it is expected to bring “catastrophic winds, life-threatening storm surge, and torrential rainfall.”
Iota, currently packing maximum sustained winds of 260 kilometers per hour, is expected to make landfall in almost the exact location where Hurricane Eta came ashore two weeks ago.
Authorities in Honduras and Nicaragua rushed to evacuate their respective citizens from coastal areas Monday ahead of the storm.
""What's drawing closer is a bomb,"" Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez said at a news conference alongside Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei.
Hurricane Eta killed at least 50 people, destroyed buildings, knocked out power and caused flooding and landslides.
Iota is the record-breaking 30th named storm of the 2020 hurricane season. Along with Eta, it marks the first time that two major hurricanes have formed in the month of November.

earthquake,"A magnitude 6.4 earthquake has struck Argentina's west-central province of San Juan on Monday night, according to a preliminary report from the United States Geological Survey.
A series of aftershocks around the country followed. A magnitude 5.0 aftershock struck 27 kilometers (about 16.8 miles) south-southwest of Nueve de Julio, around 1,000 km (620 miles) east of the first quake and almost 20 minutes later.
Then, a magnitude 4.9 quake came in the same area as the first, followed by a magnitude 5.3 aftershock.
The 4.9, 5.0 and 5.3-magnitude quakes are considered aftershocks as they are smaller in magnitude than the main quake and in the same area.
No injuries have been reported so far, according to San Juan Governor Sergio U?ac. Based on available data, there is no tsunami threat at this time, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC).
Speaking at a press conference early Tuesday, U?ac said local authorities are still analyzing the damage, which impacted streets and highways in the province. Some locations experienced power cuts, and homes experienced damage in the town of Caucete. Four people had to be evacuated from their homes in the town of Zonda, in San Juan.
The governor added that the electricity service is now gradually being reestablished. No public buildings have been damaged; some hospitals reported broken glass, but experienced no major structural damage.
U?ac urged people to stay calm after the quakes hit. ""Let's put into practice all the measures that we have learned to prevent incidents, while we are committed to knowing the impact of the (earthquake) to collaborate in everything necessary,"" he tweeted.

Typhoon,"Michele Vincent’s home was largely intact in spite of hurricanes Laura and Delta But tears streamed down her face as she looked at her church’s broken windows and shattered pews.
“It’s hard to come back and see it again and then to know there’s another (hurricane) that’s out there,” Vincent, of Cameron told The Advertiser of Lafayette. “It’s tough.”
She said people leave with every hurricane that batters Louisiana's lightly populated southwest coast.
“Yeah, our house is still there, but do you know how lonely this place is going to be?” she said.
Coastal Cameron Parish had about 9,800 residents when Hurricane Rita hit in 2005. The next census, in 2010, found about 6,800 people in the parish, Louisiana's equivalent of a county elsewhere.
“I don’t know what’ll happen now, with these two storms,” said Scott Trahan, vice president of the parish police jury.
Hurricane Laura made landfall in Cameron on Aug. 27 and Delta came in Friday near Creole, just 13 miles (21 kilometers) to the east, where Trahan lives.
“Everywhere you look it's destruction around here,” he said in a phone interview Monday with The Associated Press. “Leave Cameron Parish and go into Calcasieu it's bad there too. You can run from the water but you can't run from the winds.”

drought,"The water crisis along the California-Oregon border went from dire to catastrophic this week as federal regulators shut off irrigation water to farmers from a critical reservoir and said they would not send extra water to dying salmon downstream or to a half-dozen wildlife refuges that harbor millions of migrating birds each year.
In what is shaping up to be the worst water crisis in generations, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation said it will not release water this season into the main canal that feeds the bulk of the massive Klamath Reclamation Project, marking a first for the 114-year-old irrigation system. The agency announced last month that hundreds of irrigators would get dramatically less water than usual, but a worsening drought picture means water will be completely shut off instead.
The entire region is in extreme or exceptional drought, according to federal monitoring reports, and Oregon’s Klamath County is experiencing its driest year in 127 years.
“This year’s drought conditions are bringing unprecedented hardship to the communities of the Klamath Basin,” said Reclamation Deputy Commissioner Camille Calimlim Touton, calling the decision one of “historic consequence.” “Reclamation is dedicated to working with our water users, tribes and partners to get through this difficult year and developing long-term solutions for the basin.”
The canal, a major component of the federally operated Klamath Reclamation Project, funnels Klamath River water from the Upper Klamath Lake just north of the Oregon-California border to more than 130,000 acres (52,600 hectares), where generations of ranchers and farmers have grown hay, alfalfa and potatoes and grazed cattle.
Only one irrigation district within the 200,000-acre (80,940-hectare) project will receive any water from the Klamath River system this growing season, and it will have a severely limited supply, the Klamath Water Users Association said in a statement. Some other farmers rely on water from a different river, and they will also have a limited supply.
“This just couldn’t be worse,” said Klamath Irrigation District president Ty Kliewer. “The impacts to our family farms and these rural communities will be off the scale.”
At the same time, the agency said it would not release any so-called “flushing flows” from the same dam on the Upper Klamath Lake to bolster water levels downstream in the lower Klamath River. The river is key to the survival of coho salmon, which are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. In better water years the pulses of water help keep the river cool and turbulent — conditions that help the fragile species. The fish are central to the diet and culture of the Yurok Tribe, California’s largest federally recognized tribe."
wildfires,"There was a time when fire season in California started around May and went through September. Now, thanks to a drought that’s stretching into its fourth year, the state seems to have become a year-round tinderbox.
The long running drought has “created explosive fire conditions,” said Mike Mohler, a fire captain with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE). “Five years ago without a drought in California you would still get wildland fires. But the vegetation wouldn’t burn as quickly. Now there’s zero moisture and you get explosive fire growth.”
The drought has fed into a trend that’s been developing for over the past decade, said Daniel Berlant, chief of public information for CAL FIRE.
“Since 2000 we’ve been seeing larger and more damaging fires,” he said. “What we’re seeing now is that the rain is starting later and stopping much earlier. The fires are burning at explosive speed because the vegetation is so dry and that allows them to get much larger.”
It’s not just the low precipitation that’s the problem, Berlant says. It’s also the higher temperatures.
Those high temperatures are baking the moisture out of the soil and air, leaving vegetation especially dry and vulnerable to catching fire, said Park Williams, an assistant research professor at the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University.
Rising temperatures alone can boost the risk of wildfires, Williams said. “When you see wildfires in the Sierra Nevada and Northern Coast Ranges occurring early in the season it’s a testament to how warm conditions have become in spring,” he adds.
In a recent study published in the International Journal of Wildland Fire, Williams found that, in the Southwest, rising temperatures raised fire risk even in wetter years. That finding is likely to hold true for California, too, he said.
“Forests are excellent gauges of climate because they are not irrigated and they live for a very long time, allowing for tree-ring records and other aspects of forests to tell us how recent conditions fit into a long-term context,” Williams said. “As temperatures rise, the amount of water necessary to reduce a forest’s flammability goes up. In the absence of substantial increases in precipitation, warming causes increased flammability, and that very reliably translates to increased areas of forest burned.”"
Typhoon,"A typhoon that officials said was the most powerful to hit Vietnam in 20 years blew away from the country on Thursday after setting off landslides, sinking boats and knocking out power to at least 1.7 million people. At least 35 people were killed and more than 50 were missing, state media said.
The immediate focus for rescuers was on three villages in the country’s central region where landslides killed at least 19 people and are suspected of burying more than 40 others in thick mud and debris.
Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung traveled to the site of one landslide where soldiers were working to clear debris with bulldozers and he ordered officers to urgently send more troops to help with the efforts."
drought,"“I once rescued a friend from drowning when he was swept away by the force of the current as we were swimming in the Diyala river,” says Qasim Sabti, a painter and gallery owner in Baghdad.
“That was 50 years ago,” he recalls. “I went back there recently and the water in the Diyala is so shallow today that a man could walk across it with his dog.”
The rivers of Iraq, above all the Tigris and Euphrates, are drying up. The country is becoming more arid, and desertification is eating into the limited amount of agricultural land.
Dams built upriver in Turkey, Syria and Iran since the 1970s have reduced the flow of water that reaches Iraq by as much as half and the situation is about to get worse.
“On 1 July, Turkey will start filling the Ilisu dam on the Tigris and this will cause another decline in the inflows to our country of about 50 per cent,” Hassan Janabi, minister of water resources, told The Independent.
He says that Iraq used to get 30 billion cubic metres of water a year from the Euphrates, but now “we are happy if we get 16 billion cubic metres”.
As Iraq begins to recover from 40 years of wars and emergences, its existence is being threatened by the rapidly falling water levels in the two great rivers on which its people depend.
It was on their banks that the first cities were established cities 8,000 years ago and where the flood stories of Gilgamesh and the Bible were first told.
Such floods are now a thing of the past _ the last was in 1988 _ and each year the amount of water taken by Iraq’s neighbours has been rising."
earthquake,"Japan jolted by magnitude 6.8 earthquake; no serious injuries reported, no tsunami alert An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.8, revised up from an earlier estimate of 6.6, jolted northeast Japan on Saturday, shaking buildings 400 kilometres away in Tokyo and raising the possibility of landslides closer to the epicentre. No tsunami alert was issued after the quake, which struck at 10.27 am Japan time (0127 GMT) off the coast of Miyagi prefecture at a depth of 51 kilometres (32 miles), the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) said. The JMA earlier estimated its depth at 60 kilometres. There were no reports of serious injuries caused by the quake, but the JMA warned of the potential for strong aftershocks for about a week, as well as the heightened risk of landslides. Tokyo Electric Power (9501.T) reported there were no issues at the devastated Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, wrecked by a massive earthquake and tsunami in northeast Japan in March 2011, and sited some 105 kilometres from the epicentre of Saturday's quake. Likewise it said there were no issues at the Fukushima Daini facility, just to the south of the wrecked plant. Closer to the epicentre, there were no issues at the Onagawa nuclear station, according to operator Tohoku Electric Power Co Inc (9506.T). Bullet train services throughout northern Japan were suspended for several hours, but had resumed by late afternoon. The coast off northeast Japan has been hit by multiple earthquakes in recent months, including a magnitude 7.2 quake in March and a similar sized one in February - both said by scientists to be aftershocks from the magnitude 9 quake a decade ago that ravaged Fukushima Daiichi and was one of the strongest temblors on record. Eneos Holdings Inc, (5020.T) Japan's biggest refining company, said its Sendai refinery, also located close to the epicentre, automatically shut down as the quake struck. Engineers were making checks after confirming there were no injuries, it said. The 145,000 barrels per day refinery had only restarted in April after being damaged by the February earthquake. That quake knocked out one fifth of Japan's refining capacity."
earthquake,"MANILA, Philippines — A 7.1 magnitude quake jolted a large part of Mindanao and was felt as far as Zamboanga City at 8:23 p.m. Thursday, sending people out of houses and buildings here, most of them not wearing their face masks.
A bulletin from the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) disclosed that the epicenter of the quake was traced at 231 kilometers southeast of Jose Abad Santos town in Davao Occidental.
The quake, which was tectonic in origin and had a depth of focus of 116 kilometers, came more than a year after the series of destructive quakes that displaced thousands in Mindanao from October to December 2019.
Intensity V was recorded in General Santos City, Intensity IV in Davao City, and Intensity II in Bislig City, Surigao del Sur, it added."
